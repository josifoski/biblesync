{1:1} There was a man of one of the two Ramathaim Zophim, of mout Ephraim, named Elkana, the sonne of Ieroham, the sonne of Elihu, the sonne of Thohu, the sonne of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
{1:2} Which had two wyues, the one called Hanna, & the other Phenenna: And Phenenna had children, but Hanna had no children.
{1:3} And this man went vp out of his citie euery yere, to worship and to sacrifice vnto the Lord of hoastes in Silo, where were the two sonnes of Eli, Hophni and Phinehes, the Lordes priestes.
{1:4} And it fel on a day, that Elkana offered, and gaue to Phenenna his wyfe, and to all her sonnes and daughters, portions.
{1:5} But vnto Hanna he gaue a worthy portion: for he loued Hanna, & the Lorde had made her barren.
{1:6} And her enemie Phenenna vexed her sore, forasmuche as she vpbrayded her, because the Lord had made her barren.
{1:7} (And so dyd he yere by yere) and as oft as she wet vp to the house of the Lord, thus she vexed her, that she wept, and dyd not eate.
{1:8} Then sayde Elkana her husband to her: Hanna, why wepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thine hearte troubled? Am not I better to thee then ten sonnes?
{1:9} So Hanna rose vp after that they had eaten and drunke in Silo. (And Eli the priest sate vpon a stoole by one of the postes of the temple of the Lorde.)
{1:10} And she was troubled in her minde, and prayed vnto the Lord, & wept sore,
{1:11} And vowed a vowe, and sayd: O Lord of hoastes, if thou wilt loke on the trouble of thyne handmayde and remembre me, and not forget thyne hand mayde, but geue vnto thyne handmayde a man childe, I will geue him vnto the Lorde all the dayes of his lyfe, and there shall no rasor come vpon his head.
{1:12} And as she continued praying before the Lord, Eli marked her mouth.
{1:13} For Hanna spake in her hearte, & her lippes did but moue onely, but her voyce was not hearde, & therfore Eli thought she had ben drunken.
{1:14} And Eli sayde vnto her: Howe long wilt thou be drunken? Put away from thee the wine that thou hast.
{1:15} Hanna aunswered, and sayde, Not so my Lord: I am a woman of a sorowful hearte, I haue drunke neither wine nor strong drincke, but haue powred out my soule before the Lorde:
{1:16} Count not thine handmayde for a wicked woman: for out of the aboundaunce of my heauynesse & griefe, haue I spoken hytherto.
{1:17} Eli aunswered her againe, and sayde: Go in peace, the God of Israel graunt thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
{1:18} She said: Let thyne handmayde finde grace in thy sight. And so the woman went her way, and dyd eate, and loked no more sad.
{1:19} And they rose vp early, & worshipped before the Lorde, and then returned, & came to their house to Ramath: And when Elkana knewe Hanna his wyfe, the Lorde remembred her.
{1:20} For in processe of time it came to passe, that she conceaued, and bare a sonne, & called his name Samuel, saying: Because I haue asked him of the Lorde.
{1:21} And the man Elkana and all his house, went vp to offer vnto the Lorde the yerely sacrifice, and also his vowe.
{1:22} Neuerthelesse, Hanna wet not vp, but sayde vnto her husband: I will tary vntill the lad be weaned, and then I will bryng hym, that he may appeare before the Lord, and there abyde for euer.
{1:23} Elkana her husband aunswered her: Do what seemeth thee best, tary at home vntyll thou hast weaned him, and I beseche the Lord to make good his saying. And so the woman abode, and gaue her sonne sucke, vntyll she weaned hym.
{1:24} And when she had weaned hym, she toke hym with her, with three bullockes, and an Epha of floure, and a bottle of wine, and brought hym vnto the house of the Lorde in Silo, and the child was young.
{1:25} And they slue a bulloke, and brought in the lad to Eli.
{1:26} And she sayd: Oh my Lorde, as thy soule lyueth my Lorde, I am the woman that stoode before thee here praying vnto the Lorde.
{1:27} For this lad I prayed, and the Lorde hath geuen me my desyre whiche I asked of him:
{1:28} And therfore I haue geuen him vnto the Lord, as long as he liueth he shalbe geuen to the Lorde. And he worshipped the Lorde there.
{2:1} And Hanna prayed, & sayde: Myne heart reioyceth in the Lorde, and myne horne is exalted in the Lorde: My mouth is wyde open ouer myne enemies, for I reioyce in thy saluation.
{2:2} There is none holy as the Lorde: for without thee is nothing, neither is there any of strength as is our God.
{2:3} Talke no more proudly, let not arrogancie come out of your mouthes: for the Lorde is a God of knowledge, and his purposes come to passe.
{2:4} The bowe with the mightie men are broken, and they that were weake haue gyrde them selues with strength.
{2:5} They that were full, haue hyred out them selues for bread, and they that were hungry, ceasse, tyll the barren hath borne seuen, and she that had many children, is waxed feeble.
{2:6} The Lord kylleth and maketh alyue, bryngeth downe to the graue & fetcheth vp agayne.
{2:7} The Lord maketh poore, and maketh ryche, bringeth lowe, and heaueth vp on hye.
{2:8} He rayseth vp the poore out of the dust, and lyfteth vp the beggar from the dounghyll, to set them among princes, and to make them inherite the seate of glory: For the pyllers of the earth are the lordes, and he hath set the worlde vpon them.
{2:9} He wyll kepe the feete of his saintes, and the wicked shall kepe scilence in darknesse, and in his owne myght shal no man be strong.
{2:10} The lordes aduersaries shal be destroyed of hym, & out of heauen shall he thunder vpon them: The Lorde shall iudge the endes of the worlde, and shall gyue myght vnto his king, and exalt the horne of his annoynted.
{2:11} And Elkana went to Ramath to his house, and the lad dyd minister vnto the Lorde before Eli the priest.
{2:12} But the sonnes of Eli were children of Belial, and knewe not the Lord.
{2:13} And the priestes custome toward the people was, that whensoeuer any man offered any offring, ye priestes lad came whyle the fleshe was a seethyng, and a fleshhoke with three teeth in his hande:
{2:14} And thrust it into the panne, kettle, caldren, or pot: and all that the fleshehoke brought vp, that the priest toke for hym self: And so they dyd vnto all the Israelites that came thyther to Silo.
{2:15} Yea, and thereto before they burnt the fat, the priestes lad came and sayde to the man that offered, Geue fleshe, that I may roste it for the priest: for he wyll not haue sodde fleshe of thee, but rawe.
{2:16} And yf any man sayde vnto hym, Let them burne the fat according to the custome, and then take as much as thyne hearte desireth: Then he would aunswere hym, Yea, thou shalt geue it me nowe: and if thou wilt not, I wyll take it with violence.
{2:17} And the sinne of the young men was very great before the Lord: For men abhorred the offering of the Lord.
{2:18} But the childe Samuel ministred before the Lorde, girded with a linnen Ephod.
{2:19} Moreouer, his mother made him a litle coate, and brought it to him from yere to yere, when she came vp with her husband to offer the yerely sacrifice.
{2:20} And Eli blessed Elkana and his wife, and said: The Lorde geue thee seede of this woman, for the petition that she asked of the Lord. And they went vnto their owne home.
{2:21} And the Lorde visited Hanna, so that she conceaued, and bare three sonnes, & two daughters: And the childe Samuel grew before the Lorde.
{2:22} Eli was very olde, and heard all that his sonnes did vnto Israel, & how they lay with the women that wayted at the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{2:23} And he saide vnto them: Why do ye such thinges? For of all these people I heare euill reportes of you.
{2:24} Oh, nay my sonnes: For it is no good report that I heare, how that ye make the Lordes people to trespasse.
{2:25} If one man sinne against another, the Iudge shall iudge it: But if a man sinne against the Lord, who will be his dayseman? Notwithstandiug, they hearkened not vnto the voyce of their father, because the Lorde would slay the.
{2:26} (The childe Samuel profited & grew, and was in fauour both with the Lord and also with men.)
{2:27} And there came a man of God vnto Eli, and sayde vnto hym, thus saith the Lorde: Dyd not I playnely appeare vnto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaos house?
{2:28} And I chose him out of al the tribes of Israel to be my priest, for to offer vppon mine aulter, and to burne incense, and to weare an Ephod before me: and I gaue vnto the house of thy father, all the offerynges made by fire of the chyldren of Israel.
{2:29} Wherfore treade ye downe my sacrifice and mine offering which I comaunded in the tabernacle, and honorest thy chyldren aboue me, to make your selues fat of the first fruites of all the offerynges of Israel my people?
{2:30} Wherefore the Lorde God of Israel saith: I sayde, that thy house and the house of thy father should walke before me for euer: But nowe the Lorde saith, That be farre fro me: For them that worship me, I wyll worship, and they that despise me, shall come to shame.
{2:31} Behold, the dayes come, that I wyll cut of thine arme, and the arme of thy fathers house, that there shall not be an olde man in thine house.
{2:32} And thou shalt see thine enemie in the habitation of the Lorde and in all the wealth which God shall geue Israel, and there shall not be an olde man in thyne house for euer.
{2:33} Neuerthelesse, I wyll not destroy euery one that come of thee from mine aulter, to make thine eyes to fayle, and to make thine heart sorowfull: And all they that be multiplied in thine house, shall dye when they be men.
{2:34} And this shalbe a signe vnto thee, that shal come vpon thy two sonnes Hophni and Phinehes: euen in one day they shall dye both.
{2:35} And I wyll stirre me vp a faythfull priest, yt shall do according to my heart and minde, and I wil builde him a sure house, and he shall walke before mine annoynted for euer.
{2:36} And all that are left in thyne house, shall come and crouch to him for a peece of siluer and a morsell of bread, and shal saye: Put me (I pray thee) in one office or other among ye priestes, that I may eate a morsell of bread.
{3:1} And the chylde Samuel ministred vnto the Lorde before Eli, and the worde of the Lord was precious in those dayes, neither was there any open vision.
{3:2} And as at that tyme Eli lay in his place, his eyes began to waxe dymme that he coulde not see.
{3:3} And yet the lampe of God went out, Samuel layde hym downe to sleepe in the temple of the Lord, where the arke of God was.
{3:4} And the Lorde called Samuel. And he aunswered, I am here.
{3:5} And he ran vnto Eli, and sayde: Here am I, for thou calledst me. And he said, I called thee not, go againe and sleepe. And he went, and layde hym downe to sleepe.
{3:6} And the Lorde called once againe, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and sayde: I am here, for thou diddest call me. And he aunswered: I called thee not my sonne, go againe and sleepe.
{3:7} Samuel knewe not yet the Lorde, neither was the worde of the Lorde yet opened vnto hym.
{3:8} And the Lorde went to, and called Samuel the thirde tyme. And he arose and went to Eli, and saide: I am here, for thou hast called me. And Eli perceaued that the Lord had called the childe.
{3:9} Therefore Eli sayde vnto Samuel: Go and sleepe, and yf he call thee, then say: Speake Lorde, for thy seruaunt heareth thee. So Samuel went, and slept in his place.
{3:10} And the Lorde came, and stoode and called as before, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel aunswered: Speake, for thy seruaunt heareth.
{3:11} And the Lorde saide to Samuel: Beholde, I wyll do a thing in Israel, that both the eares of as many as heareth it shall tyngle.
{3:12} In that day, I wyll rayse vp against Eli all thynges whiche I haue spoken concernyng his house: when I begyn, I wyll also make an ende.
{3:13} I haue tolde hym that I wyll iudge his house for euer, for the wickednesse which he knoweth: For whe the people cursed his sonnes for ye same wickednesse he hath not corrected them.
{3:14} And therfore I haue sworne vnto the house of Eli, that the wickednesse of Elies house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offeryng for euer.
{3:15} Samuel slept vntyl the mornyng, and opened the doores of the house of the Lorde: and Samuel feared to shewe Eli the vision.
{3:16} Then Eli called Samuel, and sayde: Samuel, my sonne. And he aunswered: Here am I.
{3:17} He saide: What is that the Lord hath saide vnto thee? I pray thee hyde it not from me: God do so to thee, & more also, if thou hyde any thyng from me of all that he sayde vnto thee.
{3:18} And Samuel tolde hym euerywhyt, and hyd nothyng from hym. And he saide: It is the Lord, let hym do what seemeth hym good.
{3:19} And Samuel grewe, and the Lorde was with hym, and left none of his wordes vnperfourmed.
{3:20} And all Israel, from Dan to Beerseba, wyst that faythfull Samuel was the Lordes prophete.
{3:21} And the Lorde appeared againe in Silo: for the Lorde opened him selfe to Samuel in Silo, through the worde of the Lorde.
{4:1} And Samuel spake vnto all Israel: And Israel went out against the Philistines to battell, and pitched besyde the Eben ezer, and the Philistines pitched in Aphec,
{4:2} And put them selues in aray against Israel: and when they ioyned the battell, Israel was smytten downe before the Philistines, and the Philistines slue of the armie in the fielde about a foure thousand men.
{4:3} And when the people were come into their tentes, the elders of Israel sayde: Wherfore hath the Lorde caste vs downe this day before the Philistines? let vs fetch the arke of the appoyntmet of the Lorde out of Silo vnto vs, that when it cometh among vs, it may saue vs out of the hand of our enemies.
{4:4} And so the people went to Silo, and fet from thence the arke of the appoyntment of the Lorde of hoastes, which dwelleth betweene the cherubims: And there wer the two sonnes of Eli, Hophni and Phinehes, with the arke of the appoyntment of God.
{4:5} And when the arke of the appoyntment of the Lorde came into the hoast, all Israel showted a mightie showte, so that the earth rang againe.
{4:6} And when the Philistines heard the noyse of the showte, they saide: What meaneth the sounde of this mightie showte in the hoast of the Ebrues? And they vnderstode howe that the arke of the Lorde was come into the hoast.
{4:7} And the Philistines were afraide, and saide: God is come into the hoast. And they said againe: Wo vnto vs, for it was neuer so before this.
{4:8} Wo vnto vs, who shall deliuer vs out of the hand of these mightie goddes? these are the goddes that smote the Egyptians with many plagues in the wildernes.
{4:9} Be strong and quite your selues lyke men, O ye Philistines, that ye be no seruaunts vnto the Ebrues, as they haue ben to you: Be of a manly corage therfore and fight.
{4:10} And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten downe, and fled euery man into his tent: And there was an exceeding great slaughter, for there were ouerthrowen of Israel thirtie thousand footemen.
{4:11} And the arke of God was taken, and the two sonnes of Eli, Hophni & Phinehes, were dead.
{4:12} And there ran a man of Beniamin out of the armie, and came to Silo the same day with his clothes rent, and earth vpon his head.
{4:13} And when he came, lo, Eli sat vpon a stoole by the way side, wayting: for his heart feared for the arke of God. And when the man came into the citie, and tolde it, all the citie cryed.
{4:14} And when Eli heard the noyse of the crying, he saide: What meaneth this noyse of the tumult? And the man came in hastyly, and tolde Eli.
{4:15} Eli was 98 yeres olde, & his sight failed, him that he could not see.
{4:16} And the man said vnto Eli: I am he that came out of the armie, & fled this day out of the hoast. And he said: What thing is done my sonne?
{4:17} The messenger aunswered, and said: Israel is fled before the Philistines, & there hath ben a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sonnes Hophni and Phinehes are dead, and the arke of God is taken.
{4:18} And when he made mention of the arke of God, Eli fell from of his stoole backward by the side of the gate, and his necke brake, and he dyed: For he was an olde man and heauy, and iudged Israel fourtie yeres?
{4:19} And his daughter in lawe Phinehes wyfe was with childe, and nye the birth: And when she heard the tidinges that the arke of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed her selfe, and trauayled, for her paynes came vpon her.
{4:20} And about the tyme of her death, the women that stoode about her, saide vnto her: Feare not, for thou hast borne a sonne. But she aunswered not, nor regarded it.
{4:21} And she named the childe Ichabod, saying: The glorie is departed fro Israel, (because the arke of God was taken, and because of her father in lawe and her husband.)
{4:22} And she saide againe: The glorie is gone from Israel, for the arke of God is taken.
{5:1} And the Philistines toke the arke of God, and caryed it from the Eben ezer vnto Asdod.
{5:2} Yea the Philistines toke the arke of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
{5:3} And when they of Asdod were vp in the next daye in the mornyng, beholde, Dagon was fallen vpon his face on the earth before the arke of the Lorde: And they toke Dagon, and set him in his place agayne.
{5:4} And when they were come earlie in the next morning, beholde, Dagon was fallen vpon his face on the grounde before the arke of the Lorde, and his head and his two handes cut of vpon the thresholde, that onely the stumpe of Dagon was left to him.
{5:5} And therfore is it, that the priestes of Dagon, neither any man that commeth into Dagons house, treade not on the thresholde of Dagon in Asdod, vnto this day.
{5:6} But the hand of the Lorde was heauie vpon them of Asdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerodes, both Asdod, and all the coastes thereof.
{5:7} And when the men of Asdod sawe that it was so, they saide: The arke of the God of Israel shal not abide here with vs, for his hand is sore vpon vs, & vpon Dagon our God.
{5:8} They sent therfore, and gathered all the lordes of the Philistines vnto them, and saide: What shall we do with the arke of the God of Israel? They aunswered: Let the arke of the God of Israel be caryed about vnto Gath. And they caried the arke of the God of Israel about.
{5:9} And when they had caryed it about, the hand of the Lorde was agaynst the citie with a very great destruction, and he smote the men of the citie both small and great, and they had emerodes in their secrete partes.
{5:10} Therfore they sent the arke of God to Acaron: and assoone as the arke of God came to Acaron, the Acaronites cryed out, saying: They haue brought the arke of the God of Israel to vs, to slea vs, and our people.
{5:11} And so they sent, and gathered together al the lordes of the Philistines, and saide: Send away the arke of the God of Israel, to go agayne to his owne place, that it slea vs not, and our people. For there was a destruction and death thorowout all the citie, and the hand of God was exceeding sore there.
{5:12} And the men that dyed not, were smitten with the emerodes: And the crye of the citie went vp to heauen.
{6:1} And the arke of the Lord was in the countrey of the Philistines seuen monethes.
{6:2} And the Philistines called for the priestes and the soothsayers, saying: What shall we do with the arke of the Lord? Tell vs wherewith we shall sende it home againe:
{6:3} They sayde: If you send away the arke of the God of Israel, send it not emptie: but rewarde it with sinne offeryng, and then ye shall be whole, and it shall be knowen to you, why his hand departeth not from you.
{6:4} Then sayd they: And what shalbe the sinne offering, which we shall rewarde him with? They aunswered: Fiue golden emerodes, and fiue golden myce, accordyng to the number of the princes of ye Philistines: For one plague was on you all, and on your princes.
{6:5} Wherfore ye shall make images lyke to your emerodes, & images like to your myce that corrupt the land, and ye shall geue glorie vnto the God of Israel, that he may take his hand from of you, and from of your goddes, and from of your land.
{6:6} Wherfore do ye harden your heartes, as the Egyptians and Pharao hardened their heartes? Which when he wrought wonderfullie among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
{6:7} Now therfore, make a newe cart, and take two melche kyne, on whom there hath come no yocke, and tye the kyne to the carte, and bring the calues home from them.
{6:8} And take the arke of the Lorde, and lay it vpon the cart, and put the iewels of golde whiche ye rewarde him with for a sinne offering, in a coffer by the side thereof, and send it awaye, that it may go.
{6:9} And if ye see that he go vp by the way of his owne coaste to Bethsames, then it is he that did vs this great euill: If no. we shall knowe then that it is not his hand that smote vs, but it was a chaunce that happened vs.
{6:10} And the men did euen so: And toke two kyne that gaue milke, & tyed them to the cart, and kept the calues at home.
{6:11} And they layde the arke of the Lorde vpon the cart, and the coffer with the myce of golde, and with the images of their emerodes.
{6:12} And the kyne toke the strayght way to Bethsames, & went on the strayght way: and as they went, lowed, and turned neither to the ryght hande nor to the left: And the princes of the Philistines went after them, vnto the borders of Bethsames.
{6:13} And they of Bethsames were reaping their wheate haruest in the valley: And they lyft vp their eyes, and spied the arke, and reioyced when they sawe it.
{6:14} And the carte came into the fielde of one Iehosua, a Bethsamite, and stoode still ther. There was also a great stone: And they claue the wood of the carte, and offred the kyne a burnt offring vnto the Lorde.
{6:15} And the Leuites toke downe the arke of the Lorde, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the iewels of golde were, and put them on the great stone: And the men of Bethsames sacrificed burnt sacrifice, and offered offeringes the same day vnto the Lorde.
{6:16} And when the fiue princes of the Philistines had seene it, they returned to Acaron the same day.
{6:17} And these are the golden emerodes which the Philistines gaue for a sinne offering to the Lord: for Asdod one, for Gaza one, for Ascalon one, for Gath one, and for Acaron one.
{6:18} And golden myce, accordyng to the number of al the cities of the Philistines belongyng to the fyue lordes, both of walled townes, and of townes vnwalled, euen vnto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set downe the arke of the Lorde vnto this day, in the fielde of Iehosua the Bethsamite.
{6:19} And he smote of the men of Bethsames, because they had loked in the arke of the Lorde, and he slue among the people fiftie thousand and three score and ten men: And the people lamented, because the Lorde had slaine the people with so great a slaughter.
{6:20} Wherfore the men of Bethsames said: Who is able to stand before this holie Lorde God? And to whom shall he go from vs?
{6:21} And they sent messengers to the inhabitaunts of Kiriathiarim, saying: The Philistines haue brought againe the arke of the Lord, come ye downe and fet it vp to you.
{7:1} And so the men of Kiriathiarim came and set vp the arke of the Lorde, & brought it into the house of Aminadab in the hyll, and sanctified Eleazar his sonne, to keepe the arke of the Lorde.
{7:2} And while the arke abode in Kiriathiarim, the tyme was long, for it was twentie yeres: & all the house of Israel lamented after the Lorde.
{7:3} And Samnel spake vnto al the house of Israel, saying: If ye be come agayne vnto the Lorde with all your heartes, then put away the straunge gods and Astaroth from among you, and prepare your heartes vnto the Lord, and serue him onely: For he shall ryd you out of the hand of the Philistines.
{7:4} Then the children of Israel dyd put away Baalim and Astaroth, and serued the Lorde onely.
{7:5} And Samuel sayde: Gather all Israel to Mispah, and I wyll praye for you vnto the Lord.
{7:6} And they gathered together to Mispah, and drewe water, and poured it out before the Lorde, and fasted the same day, and sayd there: We haue sinned against the Lorde. And Samuel iudged the children of Israel in Mispah.
{7:7} When the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mispah, the princes of the Philistines went vp against Israel: And when the children of Israel hard that, they were afrayde of the Philistines.
{7:8} And the children of Israel sayd to Samuel: Ceasse not to crye vnto the lord our God for vs, that he may saue vs out of the hand of the Philistines.
{7:9} And Samuel toke a sucking lambe, and offered it altogether for a burnt offering vnto the Lord, and cryed vnto the Lorde for Israel, and the Lorde heard him.
{7:10} And as Samuel offered the burnt offering, the Philistines came to fight against Israel: But the Lorde thundred a great thunder the same day among the Philistines, & scattered them, that they were slaine before Israel.
{7:11} And the men of Israel went out of Mispah, and pursued the Philistines, & smote the vntill they came vnder Bethchar.
{7:12} And then Samuel toke a stone, and pitched it betweene Mispah & Shen, and called the name thereof Eben ezer, saying: Hitherto hath the Lorde helped vs.
{7:13} And so the Philistines were brought vnder, and they came no more into the coaste of Israel: and the hande of the Lorde was against the Philistines all the dayes of Samuel.
{7:14} Therto the cities which that the Philistines had taken from Israel, were restored to Israel euen from Acaron to Gath, and the coastes of the same dyd Israel deliuer out of the handes of the Philistines: And there was peace betweene Israel and the Amorites.
{7:15} Samuel iudged Israel all the dayes of his life:
{7:16} And went about yere by yere to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mispah, and iudged Israel in all those places.
{7:17} And came againe to Rama, for there was his house, and there he iudged Israel also, & there he buylt an aulter vnto the Lorde.
{8:1} When Samuel was old, he made his sonnes iudges ouer Israel.
{8:2} The name of his eldest sonne was Ioel, and the name of the seconde Abia, and they were iudges in Beerseba.
{8:3} And his sonnes walked not in his wayes, but turned aside after lucre, and tooke rewarde, and peruerted the ryght.
{8:4} Then all the elders of Israel gathered them together, and came to Samuel vnto Rama,
{8:5} And sayd vnto him: Beholde, thou art olde, and thy sonnes walke not in thy wayes: Now therfore make vs a king to iudge vs, as all other nations haue
{8:6} But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, geue vs a king to iudge vs: And Samuel prayed vnto the lorde.
{8:7} And the Lorde saide vnto Samuel, Heare the voyce of the people in all that they say vnto thee: For they haue not cast thee away, but they haue cast me away, that I should not raigne ouer them.
{8:8} And as they haue euer done sence I brought them out of Egypt vnto this day, and haue forsaken me, and serued other gods, euen so do they vnto thee.
{8:9} Now therefore hearken vnto their voyce: howbeit yet testifie vnto them, & shewe them the maner of the king that shall raigne ouer them.
{8:10} And Samuel tolde all the wordes of the Lorde vnto the people that asked a king of him,
{8:11} And he said: This shal be the maner of the king that shall raigne ouer you, he will take your sonnes and put them to his charets, and make his horsemen of them, to run before his charet.
{8:12} And will make him of the captaines ouer thousandes and ouer fifties, and will set them to eare his grounde, and to gather in his haruest, & to make instrumentes of warre, and thinges that serue for his charets.
{8:13} And he will take your daughters, and make them appoticaries, cookes, and bakers.
{8:14} And he shall take your fieldes, and your vineyardes, and your best oliue trees, and geue them to his seruauntes.
{8:15} And he shall take the tenth of your seede, and of your vineyardes, and geue it to his eunuches, & to his seruauntes.
{8:16} And he shal take your men seruauntes, and maide seruauntes, young men, and the chiefe of your asses, and put them to his worke.
{8:17} And he shall take the tenth of your sheepe, and ye shall be his seruauntes.
{8:18} And ye shall crie out at that time, because of your king whiche ye shall haue chosen you, & the Lorde wil not heare you at that day.
{8:19} Neuerthelesse, the people woulde not heare the voyce of Samuel, but did say, Nay, not so: But there shalbe a king ouer vs,
{8:20} That we may be lyke other nations, and that our king may iudge vs, and go out before vs, and fight our battailes.
{8:21} Therfore when Samuel hearde all the wordes of the people, he rehearsed them in the eares of the Lord.
{8:22} And the Lord sayd to Samuel: Hearken vnto their voyce, and make them a king. And Samuel said vnto the men of Israel: Go euery man vnto his citie.
{9:1} There was a man of Beniamin named Cis the sonne of Abiel, the sonne of Zeror, ye sonne of Bechorath, the sonne of Aphiah, the sonne of a man that was a Ieminite, mightie in power.
{9:2} And the same had a sonne called Saul, a goodly young man and a faire, so that among the children of Israel there was none goodlier then he: From the shoulders vpwarde he was hygher then all the other people.
{9:3} And the asses of this Cis Sauls father were lost, and Cis sayd to Saul his sonne: Take one of the laddes with thee, and arise, go and seke the asses.
{9:4} And he went through mount Ephraim, and passed through the lande of Salisa: but they founde them not. Then they went through the lande of Salim, and there they were not. When they went also through the land of Iemini, they found them not.
{9:5} At the last, when they were come to the lande of Zuph, Saul sayde to his lad that was with him: Come, let vs returne, lest my father leaue caring for the asses, and take thought for vs.
{9:6} He sayde vnto him: Behold, there is in this citie a man of God, & he is an honorable man, all that he sayth, commeth suerly to passe: Now then let vs go thyther, if so be he can shewe vs what way we may go.
{9:7} Then sayde Saul to his lad: If we will go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is spent in our vessels, & there is no other present to bring the man of God: what haue we?
{9:8} And the lad aunswered Saul againe, and sayde: Behold I haue found about me the fourth part of a sicle of siluer, that will I geue the man of God, to tell vs our way.
{9:9} (Before time in Israel when a man went to seke an aunswere of God, thus wyse he spake, Come and let vs go to the Seer: For he that is now called a prophete, was in the olde tyme called a Seer.
{9:10} Then sayde Saul to his lad, wel sayd of thee: Come, let vs go. And so they wet vnto the citie where the man of God was.
{9:11} And as they went their way vp the hil to the citie, they met with damosels that came out to drawe water, and sayd vnto them: Is there here a Seer?
{9:12} And the maydens aunswered them, and sayd: yea, beholde he is before you, make hast nowe, for he came this day to the citie, for ther is an offring of the people this day in the hill.
{9:13} When ye be come into the citie, ye shall finde him strayghtway yer he go vp to the hil to eate: for ye people wil not eate vntil he come, because he doth blesse the offring, and then eate they that be bydden to the feast: Nowe therfore get you vp, for this day shal ye finde him.
{9:14} And they went vp into the citie: And when they were come into the middes of the citie, beholde Samuel came out agaynst them, for to go vp to the hill.
{9:15} But the Lorde had tolde Samuel in his eare (a day before Saul came) saying:
{9:16} To morowe this tyme I wyll sende thee a man out of the lande of Beniamin, him shalt thou annoynt to be captaine ouer my people Israel, that he may saue my people out of ye handes of the Philistines: for I haue loked vpon my people, and their crie is come vnto me.
{9:17} When Samuel therfore sawe Saul, the Lorde aunswered him: See, this is the man whom I spake to thee of, this same shall raigne ouer my people.
{9:18} Then went Saul to Samuel in the middle of the gate, and sayd: Tell me I pray thee where the sears house is?
{9:19} Samuel aunswered Saul and sayd, I am the sear: Go vp before me vnto the hil, for ye shall eate with me to day, and to morowe I wil let thee go, and wil tel thee all that is in thyne heart.
{9:20} And as for thyne asses that were lost three dayes ago, care not for them, for they are founde: And whose shall the beawtiful thinges of Israel be? Belong they not to thee, and vnto all thy fathers house?
{9:21} But Saul aunswered and sayde: Am not I the sonne of a Ieminite, of the smallest tribe of Israel? and my kinred is the lest of all the kinredes of the tribe of Beniamin? Wherfore then speakest thou so to me?
{9:22} And Samuel toke Saul and his lad, and brought them into the parler, and made the sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, whiche were vpon a thirtie persons.
{9:23} And Samuel sayde vnto the cooke: Bring foorth the portion which I gaue thee, and of which I said vnto thee, kepe it with thee.
{9:24} And the cooke toke vp the shoulder, & that which was vpon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel sayd: Behold that which is left, put it before thee and eate: for hytherto hath it ben kept for thee, saying: Also I called the people. And so Saul dyd eate with Samuel that day.
{9:25} And when they were come downe fro the hyghe place into the citie, Samuel communed with Saul vpon the top of the house.
{9:26} And when they arose earely about the spring of the day, Samuel called Saul vpon the toppe of the house, saying: Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out, both he and Samuel.
{9:27} And when they were come almost out of the towne, Samuel sayde to Saul: Bid the lad go before vs (and he went before) but stande thou stil a whyle, that I may shewe thee the worde of God.
{10:1} And the Samuel toke a vessell of oyle, and powred it vpon his head, and kissed him, and sayd: Hath not the Lord annoynted thee, to be captaine ouer his inheritaunce?
{10:2} When thou art departed from me this day, thou shalt finde two men by Rahels sepulchre in ye border of Beniamin, euen at Zalezah, and they wil say vnto thee, ye asses which thou wetest to seke, are found: And lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, & soroweth for you, saying: what shal I do for my sonne?
{10:3} Then shalt thou go foorth fro thence, & shalt come to the playne of Thabor, and ther shal meete thee three me going vp to God to Bethel, one carying three kiddes, & another carying three loues of bread, & another carying a botel of wine.
{10:4} And they wil salute thee and geue thee two loues of bread, which thou shalt receaue of their handes.
{10:5} After that, shalt thou come to the hil of God, wher is the garison of the Philistines: And when thou art come thyther to the citie, thou shalt meete a companie of prophetes comming downe fro the hyghe place, with a psalter, a timbrell, a pype, & a harpe before them, and they shal prophesie.
{10:6} And the spirite of the Lorde wil come vpon thee also, and thou shalt prophsie with them, & shalt be turned into another man.
{10:7} Therfore when these signes are come vnto thee, do what thou hast to do, for God is with thee.
{10:8} And thou shalt go downe before me to Gilgal, and I also will come downe vnto thee to sacrifice burnt sacrifices, & to offre peace offringes: Tary for me seuen dayes till I come to thee, & shewe thee what thou shalt do.
{10:9} And when he had turned his backe to go fro Samuel, God gaue him another hearte, and all those tokens came to passe that same day.
{10:10} And when they came thyther to the hill, beholde, the companie of prophetes met him, and the spirite of God came vpon him, & he prophecied among the.
{10:11} And all that knewe him before, when they sawe that he prophecied among the prophetes, they sayd eche to other: what is this that is come vnto the sonne of Cis? Is Saul also among the prophetes?
{10:12} And one of the same place aunswered, and sayde: Who is their father? And therof came ye prouerbe: What is Saul also among the prophetes?
{10:13} And whe he had made an ende of prophecying, he came to the hyghe place.
{10:14} And Sauls vncle sayde vnto him, and to his lad: Whyther went ye? He sayde, To seke the asses: And when we sawe that they were no where, we came to Samuel.
{10:15} And Sauls vncle sayde: Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel sayd vnto you?
{10:16} Saul aunswered his vncle: He tolde vs plainely that the asses were found. But of ye kingdome wherof Samuel spake, tolde he him not.
{10:17} And Samuel called the people together vnto the Lorde to Mispah,
{10:18} And sayd vnto the children of Israel: Thus sayde the Lorde God of Israel, I brought Israel out of Egypt, and deliuered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the handes of al kingdomes that troubled you.
{10:19} And ye haue this day cast away your God, who onely deliuereth you out of al your aduersities and tribulations. And ye haue sayd vnto him: No, but make a king ouer vs. Nowe therfore stande ye before the Lorde by your tribes, & your thousandes.
{10:20} And when Samuel had assembled together all the tribes of Israel, the tribe of Beniamin was taken.
{10:21} When he had assembled together the tribe of Beniamin by their kinredes, the kinred of Matri was caught, and at the last Saul the sonne of Cis was caught: And when they sought him, he coulde not be founde.
{10:22} Therfore they asked the Lord further, if the man should yet come thyther? And the Lord aunswered: Behold he hath hyd him selfe among the stuffe.
{10:23} And they ranne and set him thence, and when he stoode among the people, he was hygher then any of the people from the shoulders vpwarde.
{10:24} And Samuel said to al the people: See ye not him whom the Lorde hath chosen, and howe there is none lyke him among all the people? And all the people showted, and sayd: God saue the king.
{10:25} Then Samuel tolde the people the duetie of the kingdome, & wrote it in a booke, and laide it vp before the Lord, and sent all the people away, euery man to his house.
{10:26} And Saul also went home to Gibea, and there folowed him a band of men, whose heartes God had touched.
{10:27} But the children of Belial sayd: Howe shall he saue vs? And they despised him, and, brought him no presentes: And he helde his tongue.
{11:1} Then Nahas ye Ammonite came vp, & besieged Iabes in Gilead: And all the men of Iabes sayd vnto Nahas, Make a couenaut with vs, and we wilbe thy seruauntes.
{11:2} And Nahas the Ammonite aunswered them: In this will I make a couenaunt with you, if I may thrust out al your right eyes, and bring that shame vpon all Israel.
{11:3} To whom the elders of Iabes sayde: Geue vs seuen dayes respite, that we may sende messengers vnto all ye coastes of Israel: and then if there be no man to deliuer vs, we will come out to thee.
{11:4} Then came the messengers to Gibea of Saul, and tolde this tydinges in the eares of the people: And all the people lift vp their voyces, and wept.
{11:5} And beholde, Saul came folowing the cattell out of the fielde, and Saul sayde: what alyeth this people that thei wepe? And they tolde him the tydinges of the men of Iabes.
{11:6} And the spirite of God came vpon Saul when he heard those tydinges, & he was exceeding angrie.
{11:7} And toke a yoke of oxen, & hewed them in peeces, and sent them thorowout all the coastes of Israel by the handes of messengers, saying: Whosoeuer cometh not foorth after Saul and after Samuel, so shal his oxen be serued. And the feare of the Lord fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.
{11:8} And whe he numbred them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand men, and the men of Iuda thirtie thousande.
{11:9} And they sayd vnto the messengers that came: So say vnto the men of Iabes in Gilead, To morowe by that time ye sunne be hotte ye shal haue helpe. And the messengers came, and shewed it to the men of Iabes, which were glad.
{11:10} Therfore the men of Iabes sayde: To morowe we will come out vnto you, and ye shall do with vs all that pleaseth you.
{11:11} And on the morowe Saul put the people in three partes, & they came in vpon the hoast in the morning watche, and slue the Ammonites vntill the heate of the day: And they that remayned, were skattered, so that two of them were not left together.
{11:12} And the people sayd vnto Samuel: Who is he that sayde, shal Saul raigne ouer vs? bring those men, that we may slay them.
{11:13} And Saul sayde: There shall no man dye this day: For to day the Lorde hath saued Israel.
{11:14} Then sayde Samuel vnto the people: Come, that we may go to Gilgal, and renue the kingdome there.
{11:15} And all the people went to Gilgal, and made Saul king there before the Lord in Gilgal, and there they offred peace offringes before the Lorde: And there Saul and al the men of Israel reioyced exceedingly.
{12:1} And Samuel sayd vnto al Israel: Beholde, I haue hearkened vnto your voyce in all that ye sayde vnto me, and haue made a king ouer you.
{12:2} Nowe therfore, your king walketh before you: and I am olde and graye headed, and behold my sonnes are with you, & I haue walked before you from my childehod vnto this day.
{12:3} Beholde here I am, beare recorde of me before the Lorde & before his annoynted: Whose oxe haue I taken? or whose asse haue I taken? whom haue I done wrong to? Whom haue I hurt? Or of whose hande haue I receaued any bribe, to blind myne eyes therwith? and I will restore it you.
{12:4} They sayde: Thou hast done vs no wrong, nor hurt vs, neither hast thou taken ought of any mans hande.
{12:5} He sayd vnto them againe: The Lord is witnesse against you, and his annoynted is witnesse this day, that ye haue found naught in my handes. And they aunswered: He is witnesse.
{12:6} And Samuel sayd vnto the people: It is the Lorde that made Moyses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers out of the lande of Egypt.
{12:7} Nowe therfore stand still, that I may reason with you before the Lorde, according to all the righteousnesses of the Lorde, whiche he shewed both you and your fathers.
{12:8} After yt Iacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cryed vnto the Lord, the Lord sent Moyses & Aaron, which brought your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwel in this place.
{12:9} And whe they forgat the Lord their God, he solde the into ye hand of Sisara captayne of the hoast of Hazor, & into the hande of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
{12:10} And they cryed vnto the Lord, & sayd: We haue sinned, because we haue forsaken the Lord, and haue serued Baalim and Astharoth: Nowe therfore deliuer vs out of the handes of our enemies, and we will serue thee.
{12:11} And ye Lord sent Ierobaal, Bedan, Iephthah, and Samuel, and deliuered you out of the handes of your enemies on euerie side, and ye dwelled safe.
{12:12} And for all that, when you sawe that Nahas the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye sayd vnto me: Not so, but a king shall raigne ouer vs: when yet the Lord your God was your king.
{12:13} Nowe therfore behold the king whom ye haue chosen, and whom ye haue desired: lo, ye Lorde hath set a king ouer you.
{12:14} If ye will feare the Lorde and serue him, and heare his voyce, & not disobey the worde of the Lorde, both ye and the king that raigneth ouer you, shall folowe the Lord your God.
{12:15} If ye will not hearken vnto the voyce of the Lorde, but disobey the Lordes mouth, then shall the hand of the Lord be vpon you, and on your fathers.
{12:16} Now also stand, & see this great thing whiche the Lorde will do before your eyes.
{12:17} Is it not nowe wheate hearuest? I will call vnto the Lorde, & he shal sende thunder & rayne, that ye may perceaue and see howe that your wickednes is great which ye haue done in the sight of the Lord in asking you a king.
{12:18} And so Samuel called vnto the Lord, and the Lorde sent thunder and rayne the same day: And all the people feared the Lord and Samuel exceedingly.
{12:19} And al the people sayd vnto Samuel: Pray for thy seruauntes vnto the Lord thy God, that we dye not: for we haue sinned in asking vs a king, besyde all our other sinnes.
{12:20} And Samuel sayde vnto the people, feare not (Ye haue in deede done al this wickednesse, yet depart not from folowing of the Lorde, but serue the Lorde with all your heartes:
{12:21} Neither turne ye away, for then ye go after vayne thinges, which are not able to profite you, nor deliuer you, for they are but vanitie.)
{12:22} For the Lorde will not forsake his people, because of his great names sake: because it hath pleased the Lorde to make you his people.
{12:23} Moreouer, God forbid that I shoulde sinne against the Lord, and ceasse praying for you: but I will shewe you the good and right way.
{12:24} Therfore feare you the Lorde, & serue him in the trueth, and with all your heartes: & consider howe great thinges he hath done for you.
{12:25} But and yf ye do wickedly, then shall ye perishe, both ye and your king.
{13:1} Saul now had ben king one yere (& he raigned two yeres ouer Israel.)
{13:2} And Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel: Two thousand were with Saul in Michmas and in mount Bethel, and a thousand with Ionathan in Gibea Beniamin: and the rest of the people he sent euery man to his tent.
{13:3} And Ionathan smote the garison of the Philistines that was in the hill, and it came to the Philistines eares: And Saul blewe ye trumpet throughout al the land, saying: Let the Hebrues heare.
{13:4} And all Israel hearde say howe that Saul had destroyed a garison of ye Philistines: wherfore Israel was had in abomination with ye Pilistines. And the people gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.
{13:5} The Philistines also gathered them selues together to fyght with Israel, thirtie thousand charettes, & sixe thousand horsemen, with other people lyke the sand by the seas side in multitude, & came vp, and pitched in Michmas, eastwarde from Bethauen.
{13:6} And when the men of Israel sawe it, they were in a strayte (and the people were in a distresse) & the people hyd the selues in caues, and in holdes, and in rockes, and iin hye places, and in pittes.
{13:7} And some of the Hebrues went ouer Iordane to go vnto the land of Gad and Gilead: And Saul was yet in Gilgal, and all the people being afrayde, folowed him.
{13:8} And he taried seuen dayes, euen vnto the time that Samuel had appoynted: But Samuel came not to Gilgal, and the people were therfore skattered from him.
{13:9} And Saul sayde: Bring a burnt sacrifice to me, and peace offeringes. And he offered a burnt sacrifice.
{13:10} And assoone as he had made an ende of offering the burnt sacrifice, beholde Samuel came, and Saul went against him, to salute him.
{13:11} And Samuel sayde: What hast thou done? Saul sayde: Because I sawe that the people skattered from me, and that thou camest not within the dayes appointed, and that the Philistines gathered them selues together to Michmas:
{13:12} Therfore sayde I, The Philistines shal come downe nowe vpon me to Gilgal, and I haue not made supplication vnto the Lord: I was bolde therfore, & offred a burnt offring.
{13:13} And Samuel sayd to Saul: Thou art become a foole, thou hast not kept the commaundemet of the Lord thy God which he commauded thee: For at this time woulde the Lorde haue stablished thy kingdome vpon Israel for euer.
{13:14} But nowe, thy kingdome shal not continue: The Lorde hath sought him a man after his owne heart, and the Lord hath commaunded him to be captayne ouer his people, because thou hast not kept that whiche the Lorde commaunded thee.
{13:15} And Samuel arose, & gate him vp from Gilgal in Gibea of Beniamin, and Saul numbred the people that were found with him, and they were about a sixe hundred men.
{13:16} And Saul and Ionathan his sonne, & the people that were found with them, had their abiding in Gibea of Beniamin: but ye Philistines pitched in Michmas.
{13:17} And there came out of the hoast of the Philistines three copanies to destroye: one companie turned vnto the way that leadeth to Ophra vnto ye lande of Sual:
{13:18} And another companie turned the way to Bethoron: And the thirde companie turned to the way of the coast that is seene aboue ye valley of Zeboim toward the wildernesse.
{13:19} There was no smith founde throughout all the lande of Israel: For the Philistines sayde, Lest the Hebrues make them swordes or speares.
{13:20} But all the Israelites went downe to the Philistines, to mende euery man his share, his mattocke, his axe, & weeding hooke.
{13:21} Yet they had a file for the shares, for the mattockes, for the pickforkes, and for the axes, and for to sharpen to goades.
{13:22} And so in time of battel there was neither sword nor speare found in the handes of any of the people that were with Saul and Ionathan: But with Saul & Ionathan his sonne was there found.
{13:23} And the garison of the Philistines came out, to go ouer vnto Michmas.
{14:1} Then on a time Ionathan the sonne of Saul sayde vnto his young man that bare his harnesse: Come, & let vs go ouer to the Philistines garison that are yonder on the other syde: and he tolde not his father.
{14:2} And Saul taried in the vttermost part of Gibea vnder a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were vpo a sixe hundred men.
{14:3} And Ahia the sonne of Ahitob, Ichabods brother, the sonne of Phinehesthe sonne of Eli, was the Lordes priest in Silo, and ware an Ephod: And the people wist not that Ionathan was gone.
{14:4} And in the middes of the passage by which Ionathan sought to go ouer vnto the Philistines garison, there was a sharpe rocke on the one syde, & a sharpe rocke on the other syde: the one called Bozez, and the other Sene.
{14:5} The forefront of the one leaned northwarde towarde Michmas, & the other was southward toward Gibea.
{14:6} And Ionathan sayd to the young man that bare his harnesse: Come, and let vs go ouer vnto the garison of these vncircumcised, it may be that the Lorde will worke with vs: for it is no hardnesse with the Lord to saue either in manie or in fewe.
{14:7} And his harnesse bearer said vnto him, Do all that is in thyne heart: Go where it pleaseth thee, behold I am with thee as thyne heart lusteth.
{14:8} Then sayd Ionathan: Beholde, we go ouer vnto these men, and shall shewe our selues vnto them.
{14:9} Yf they say on this wyse to vs, Tarie vntil we come to you: then we wil stand still in our place, & not go vp vnto them.
{14:10} But and if they say, Come vp vnto vs: then we wil go vp, for the Lorde hath deliuered them into our handes: And this shalbe a signe vnto vs.
{14:11} And they both shewed them selues vnto the garison of the Philistines. And the Philistines sayde: See, the Hebrues come out of the holes where they had hyd them selues in.
{14:12} And the men of the garison aunswered Ionathan & his harnesse bearer, & sayd: Come vp to vs, and we will shewe you a thing. And Ionathan sayde vnto his harnesse bearer: Come vp after me, for the Lorde hath deliuered them into the hande of Israel.
{14:13} And Ionathan clymed vp vpon handes and feete, and his harnesse bearer after him: And they fell before Ionathan, & his harnesse bearer slue the after him.
{14:14} And that first slaughter whiche Ionathan & his harnesse bearer made, was vpon a twentie men, within the compasse as it were about an halfe aker of land which two oxen plowe.
{14:15} And there was a feare in the hoast, in the field, & among al ye people: insomuch that they that were gone out of the garrison to robbe, were afrayde also, & the earth trembled, for the feare that was sent of God.
{14:16} And the watchmen of Saul in Gibea Beniamin, sawe: And behold, the multitude were discomfited, & were smitten as they went.
{14:17} Then sayd Saul vnto the people that was with him: Searche, and see who is gone away from vs. And when they had numbred, beholde, Ionathan and his harnesse bearer were not there.
{14:18} And Saul sayd vnto Ahia: Bring hyther the arke of God. (For the arke of God was at time with the children of Israel.)
{14:19} And while Saul talked vnto ye priest, the noyse that was in the hoaste of the Philistines spred farther abrode and encreased. And Saul sayd vnto the priest: Withdrawe thyne hande.
{14:20} And Saul ioyned him selfe vnto al the people that were with him, & they came to the battell, and behold euery mans sword was against his felow, and there was a very great discomfiture.
{14:21} Moreouer, the Hebrues that were with the Philistines before that tyme, & were come with them into all partes of the hoaste, turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Ionathan.
{14:22} And all the men of Israel also, whiche had hyd the selues in mount Ephraim, assoone as they hearde howe that the Philistines were fled, they folowed after them in the battel.
{14:23} And so the Lorde saued Israel that day: and the battel continued vnto Bethauen.
{14:24} And when the men of Israel were kepte downe with hunger that day, Saul charged the people with an oth, saying: Cursed be the man that eateth any foode vntill night, till I be auenged of myne enemies. And so none of the people tasted any sustenaunce.
{14:25} And al they of the land came to a wood, where honie lay vpon the grounde.
{14:26} And the people came into the wood: And behold, the honie dropped, and no man moued his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oth.
{14:27} But Ionathan hearde not whe his father charged the people with the oth, wherfore he put foorth the ende of the rod that was in his hand, and dipt it in an honie combe, & put his hande to his mouth, and his eyes receaued sight.
{14:28} Then aunswered one of the people, and sayde: Thy father made the people to sweare, saying: Cursed be the ma that eateth any sustenaunce this day. And the people were faynt.
{14:29} The sayd Ionathan, My father hath troubled the lande: See howe myne eyes hath receaued sight, because I tasted a litle of this honie:
{14:30} Howe muche more then to day, if the people had eaten of the spoyle of their enemies whiche they found? And had there not ben then a muche greater slaughter among the Philistines?
{14:31} And they smote the Philistines that day, from Michmas to Aialon: And the people were exceeding faynt.
{14:32} And the people gat them to the spoyle, and toke sheepe, oxen, and calues, & slue them on the ground, and the people dyd eate them with the blood.
{14:33} Then men tolde Saul, saying: Behold, the people sinne against the Lorde, in that they eate with the blood. And he sayde, Ye haue trespassed: Rowle a great stone vnto me this day.
{14:34} And Saul sayde againe: Go abrode among the people, and bid them bring me euery man his oxe, and euery man his sheepe, and slay them here, and eate, and sinne not against the Lorde in eating with the blood. And the people brought euery man his oxe in his hande that night, and slue them there.
{14:35} And Saul made an aulter vnto ye Lord: And that was the first aulter that he made vnto the Lorde.
{14:36} And Saul sayde: Let vs go downe after the Philistines by night, and spoyle them, vntil it be day in the morning, and let vs not leaue one man of them. And they sayde: Do whatsoeuer thou thinkest best. Then sayde the priest: Let vs come hyther vnto God.
{14:37} And Saul asked of God: Shall I go downe after the Philistines? Wilt thou deliuer them into the handes of Israel? But he aunswered him not at that time.
{14:38} And Saul sayde: Let al the chiefe of the people come hyther, and knowe and see by whom this sinne is done this day.
{14:39} For as the Lorde liueth, whiche saued Israel, though it be in Ionathan my sonne, he shal dye the death. But there was no man among all the people that aunswered him.
{14:40} Then he sayde vnto al Israel: Be ye on one syde, and I and Ionathan my sonne will be on the other syde. And the people saide vnto Saul: What thou thinkest best, that do.
{14:41} Therfore Saul saide vnto the Lorde God of Israel, geue a perfect lot. And Saul and Ionathan were caught: but the people scaped free.
{14:42} And Saul said: Cast lot betweene me and Ionathan my sonne. And Ionathan was caught.
{14:43} Then Saul saide to Ionathan: Tell me what thou hast done. And Ionathan tolde him, and sayde: I tasted a litle honie with the ende of the rod that was in myne hand, & lo, I must dye.
{14:44} Saul aunswered: God do so & more also to me, thou shalt dye the death Ionathan.
{14:45} And the people said vnto Saul: Shal Ionathan dye, which hath so mightilie deliuered Israel? God forbid. As the Lord lyueth, there shall not one heere of his head fall to ye ground, for he hath wrought with God this daye. And so the people deliuered Ionathan, that he dyed not.
{14:46} And then Saul departed vp from folowing the Philistines: And the Philistines went to their owne place.
{14:47} And so Saul helde the kingdome ouer Israel, and fought against all his enemies on euery side, against Moab, against the children of Ammon, against Edom, against the kinges of Zoba, and against the Philistines: And whyther soeuer he turned him selfe, he put them to the worse.
{14:48} And he gathered his hoast together, & smote the Amalekites, & rid Israel out of the handes of them that spoyled them.
{14:49} The sonnes of Saul were, Ionathan, Iessui, and Melchisua: And his two daughters were thus named, the elder was called Merob, and the younger Michol.
{14:50} And the name of Sauls wife, was Ahinoa, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of his chiefe captaine, was Abner the sonne of Ner, Sauls vncle.
{14:51} And Cis was Sauls father: & Ner the father of Abner, was the sonne of Abiel.
{14:52} And there was sore warre against the Philistines all ye dayes of Saul: And whomsoeuer Saul sawe to be a strong man, and meete for the warre, he toke him vnto him.
{15:1} Samuel also saide vnto Saul: The Lord sent me to anoynt thee, to be king ouer his people, ouer Israel: Now therfore hearken thou vnto the voyce of the wordes of the Lorde.
{15:2} Thus saith the Lorde of hoastes: I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how they layed waite for them in the waye as they came vp from Egypt.
{15:3} Nowe therfore go, and smyte Amalek, and destroye ye all that pertaineth vnto them, and haue no compassion on them, slay both man & woman, infant and suckling, oxe and sheepe, camel and asse.
{15:4} And Saul gathered the people together, and numbred them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footemen, and ten thousand men of Iuda.
{15:5} And Saul came vnto a citie of Amalek, and set watch in the brooke.
{15:6} And Saul saide vnto the Kenites: Go, & depart, & get you downe from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed mercie to all the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt. And so the Kenites departed from among ye Amalekites.
{15:7} And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Heuila, as thou commest to Sur, that lyeth before Egypt.
{15:8} And toke Agag the king of the Amalekites alyue, and vtterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sworde.
{15:9} But Saul and the people spared Agag, the better sheepe, and the fatter oxen, and the lambes, and all that was good, & would not destroy them: But al that was foule & naught worth, that they destroyed vtterlie.
{15:10} Then came the word of the Lord vnto Samuel, saying:
{15:11} It repenteth me that I haue made Saul king: For he is turned from me, & hath not perfourmed my commaundementes. And Samuel was euill apayed, & cryed vnto the Lord all night.
{15:12} And whe Samuel rose early to meete Saul in the morning, it was tolde Samuel that Saul was come to Carmel, and beholde, he hath made him there a place, and is returned, and departed and gone downe to Gilgal.
{15:13} And Samuel came to Saul, & Saul said vnto him, Blessed be thou in the Lorde: I haue fulfilled the comaundement of the Lord.
{15:14} Samuel sayde: What meaneth then the bleating of the sheepe in mine eares and the lowing of the oxen which I heare?
{15:15} Saul aunswered, They haue brought them from the Amalekites: For the people spared the best of the sheepe, and of the oxen, to sacrifice them vnto the Lorde thy God, and the remnaunt haue we destroyed vtterlie.
{15:16} Samuel said to Saul: Let me tell thee what the Lorde hath saide to me this night. And he sayd vnto him: saye on.
{15:17} Samuel said: When thou wast litle in thyne owne sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lorde annoynted thee kyng ouer Israel?
{15:18} And the Lorde sent thee on a iourney, and said: Go, and vtterly destroy those sinners the Amalekites, & fight against them vntyll thou destroy them.
{15:19} And wherfore hast thou not hearkened vnto the voyce of the Lorde? but hast turned to the praye, and hast done that which is wicked in the syght of the Lorde?
{15:20} And Saul sayde vnto Samuel: Yea, I haue hearkened vnto the voyce of the Lorde, and haue gone the way which the Lord sent me vnto, & haue brought Agag the kyng of Amalek, and haue destroyed the Amalekites.
{15:21} But the people toke of ye spoyle, sheepe, oxen, and the chiefest of the thynges whiche shoulde haue ben destroyed, to offer vnto the Lord thy God in Gilgal.
{15:22} And Samuel sayde: Hath the Lorde as great pleasure in burnt sacrifices and offerynges, as when the voyce of the Lorde is obeyed? Beholde, to obey, is better then sacrifice: and to hearken, is better then the fat of rammes.
{15:23} For rebellion is as the sinne of witchcraft, and stubbernnesse is as the wickednes of idolatrie: Because thou hast cast away the worde of the Lorde, therefore he hath cast away thee also from being king.
{15:24} And Saul sayde vnto Samuel, I haue sinned: For I haue gone farther then the saying of the Lorde and thy wordes, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voyce.
{15:25} Now therfore I pray thee take away my sinne, and turne agayne with me, that I may worship the Lorde.
{15:26} And Samuel sayde vnto Saul, I wyll not returne with thee: For thou hast cast away the worde of the Lorde, and the Lord hath cast away thee, that thou shalt not be kyng ouer Israel.
{15:27} And as Samuel turned hym selfe to go away, he caught the lappe of his coate, and it rent.
{15:28} And Samuel sayde vnto hym: The Lorde hath rent the kyngdome of Israel from thee this day, and hath geuen it to a neighbour of thine that is better then thou.
{15:29} The strength of Israel wyl not beguyle, nor repent: for he is not a man that shoulde repent.
{15:30} He sayde, I haue sinned: But nowe honour me before the elders of my people and before Israel, and turne againe with me, that I may worship the Lord thy God.
{15:31} And so Samuel turned againe, and folowed Saul: and Saul worshipped the Lorde.
{15:32} Then sayde Samuel: Bryng you hyther to me Agag, the kyng of the Amalekites. And Agag came vnto hym dilicately, and Agag sayde: Truely the bitternesse of death is past.
{15:33} And Samuel sayde: As thy sworde hath made women chyldlesse, so shall thy mother be chyldlesse aboue other women. And Samuel hewed Agag in peeces before the Lorde in Gilgal.
{15:34} And then Samuel departed to Rama, and Saul went home to his house to Gibea Saul.
{15:35} And Samuel came no more to see Saul, vntyll the day of his death: Neuerthelesse Samuel mourued for Saul: and the Lorde repented that he had made Saul kyng ouer Israel.
{16:1} The Lorde sayd vnto Samuel: Howe long wilt thou mourne for Saul, seing I haue cast him away from raigning ouer Israel? Fill thyne horne with oyntment, and come, that I may send thee to Isai the Bethlemite: for I haue prouided me a king among his sonnes.
{16:2} And Samuel sayd: How can I go? For if Saul heare it, he will kill me. The Lord aunswered: Take an heyfer with thee, and saye: I am come to offer to the Lorde.
{16:3} And call Isai to the offering, and I will shewe thee what thou shalt do: And thou shalt annoynt vnto me him whom I name vnto thee.
{16:4} And so Samuel did as the Lord bade him, and came to Bethlehem: and the elders of the towne were astonyed at his comming, and saide: Commest thou peaceably?
{16:5} He aunswered: Yea, I am come to offer vnto the Lorde: Sanctifie your selues, and come with me to the offering. And he sanctified Isai and his sonnes, and bade them to the offering.
{16:6} And when they were come, he loked on Eliab, & saide: Surelye the Lordes annoynted is before him.
{16:7} But the Lorde sayde vnto Samuel: Loke not on his fashion, or on ye height of his stature, because I haue refused him: For God seeth not as man seeth. For man loketh on the outward appearaunce, but the Lorde beholdeth the heart.
{16:8} Then Isai called Abinadab, & made him come before Samuel, and he sayd: Neither hath the Lorde chosen this.
{16:9} Then Isai made Samma come, and he sayd: Neither yet hath the Lorde chosen him.
{16:10} Againe Isai made seuen of his sonnes to come before Samuel, and Samuel sayd vnto Isai: The Lorde hath chosen none of these.
{16:11} And Samuel sayde vnto Isai: Are heare all thy children? He sayde: There is, yet a litle one behind, that kepeth the sheepe. And Samuel said vnto Isai, Sende and fet him: for we will not syt downe, till he be come hyther.
{16:12} And he sent, and brought him in: And he was ruddie, and of an excellet beawtie, and wel fauoured in sight. And the Lorde said, Aryse & annoynt him: For this is he.
{16:13} Therefore Samuel toke the horne with the annoyntment, and annoynted him in the middes of his brethren. And the spirite of the Lorde came vpon Dauid from that daye forwarde: And Samuel rose vp, and went to Rama.
{16:14} But the spirite of the Lorde departed from Saul, and an euill spirite sent of the Lord vexed him.
{16:15} And Sauls seruauntes said vnto him: Beholde, an euill spirite sent of God vexeth thee.
{16:16} Let our Lorde therefore commaunde thy seruauntes (that are before thee) to seeke a man that is a cunnyng player with an harpe: that when the euill spirite of God commeth vpon thee, he may play with his hande, & thou shalt be eased.
{16:17} Saul sayd vnto his seruauntes: Prouide me a man then that can play well, and bring him to me.
{16:18} The aunswered one of his seruauntes and said: Beholde, I haue seene a sonne of Isai the Bethlehemite, that can play vpon instrumentes, and is strong, valiaunt, and a man of warre, and prudent in doing of feates, and well made, and the Lorde is with him.
{16:19} Wherefore Saul sent messengers vnto Isai, and said: Sende me Dauid thy sonne, which is with the sheepe.
{16:20} And Isai tooke an asse laden with bread, and a flacket of wine, and a kyd, and sent them by Dauid his sonne vnto Saul.
{16:21} And Dauid came to Saul, and stoode before him, and he loued him very well, & he was made his harnesse bearer.
{16:22} And Saul sent to Isai, saying: Let Dauid nowe remaine with me, for he hath founde fauour in my sight.
{16:23} And so when the euill spirite of God came vpon Saul, Dauid toke an harpe and played with his hand: and so Saul was refreshed, & did amende, and the euyll spirite departed from him.
{17:1} The Philistines gathered their hoast to battayle, and came together to Socho which is in Iuda, and pytched betweene Socho and Azekah, in the coaste of Dammim.
{17:2} And Saul & the men of Israel came together, and pytched in the valley of Elah, and put them selues in battaile aray, to meete the Philistines.
{17:3} And the Philistines stoode on a mountaine on the one syde, and Israel stoode on a mountaine on the other syde, and there was a valley betweene them.
{17:4} And there came a man betweene the both, out of the tentes of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath: sixe cubites and a handbreadth long:
{17:5} And had an helmet of brasse vpon his head, and a coate of male about him. And the weight of his coate of mayle, was fiue thousand sicles of brasse.
{17:6} And he had bootes of brasse vpon his legges, and a shielde of brasse vpon his shoulders.
{17:7} And the shaft of his speare was lyke a weauers beame, and his speare head wayed sixe hundred sicles of iron: And one bearing a shielde went before him.
{17:8} And he stoode and cryed against the hoast of Israel, and sayde vnto them: Why are ye come to set your battaile in array? am not I a Philistine, and you seruauntes to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come downe to me.
{17:9} And if he be able to fyght with me, & to kill me, then will we be your seruauntes: But if I can ouercome hym & beate him, then shal ye be our seruautes and serue vs.
{17:10} And the Philistine sayde: I defie the hoast of Israel this day, geue me a man, that we may fight together.
{17:11} When Saul and all Israel heard those wordes of ye Philistine, they were discouraged, and greatly afraide.
{17:12} Dauid was the sonne of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem Iuda, named Isai, which had eyght sonnes, & this man was taken for an olde man in the dayes of Saul.
{17:13} And the three eldest sonnes of Isai went, and folowed Saul to the battell: And the names of his three sonnes that went to battaile, were: Eliab the eldest, and the next Abinadab, and the thyrd Samma:
{17:14} And Dauid was the leaste. And the three eldest, went after Saul.
{17:15} Dauid also went, and departed from Saul, to feede his fathers sheepe at Bethlehem.
{17:16} And the Philistine came foorth in the morning and euening, and continued fourtie dayes.
{17:17} And Isai sayd vnto Dauid his sonne: Take for thy brethren an Epha of this partched corne, & these ten loaues, and runne to the hoast to thy brethren.
{17:18} And cary these ten freshe cheeses vnto the captayne, and loke howe thy brethren fare, and set out their pledge.
{17:19} And Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fyghtyng with the Philistines.
{17:20} And Dauid rose vp early in ye morning, and left the sheepe with a keper, & toke, and went as Isai had commaunded him, and came within the compasse of the hoast: And the hoast went out in array, and shouted in the battaile.
{17:21} For Israel and the Philistines had put them selues in array armie against armie.
{17:22} And Dauid left the thinges which he bare, vnder the handes of the keper of the vessels, and ran into the hoast, and came, and saluted his brethren.
{17:23} And as he talked with them, behold, there stoode a man in the middes (Goliath the Philistine by name, of Gath) out of the armie of the Philistines, & spake such wordes: and Dauid heard it.
{17:24} And all the people of Israel, when they sawe the man, ranne away from him, and were sore afrayde.
{17:25} And euery man of Israel said: Sawe ye not this man that commeth vp? euen to reuile Israel is he come: And to him that killeth him, will the king geue great ritches, and will geue him his daughter thereto, yea and make his fathers house free in Israel.
{17:26} And Dauid spake to ye men that stoode by, and sayd: What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh awaye the shame from Israel? And what is this vncircumcised Philistine, that he shoulde reuile the hoast of the liuing God?
{17:27} And the people aunswered him (after this maner) saying: So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.
{17:28} And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake vnto the men, and Eliab was angrye with Dauid, & sayde: Why camest thou downe hyther? and with whom hast thou left those fewe sheepe in the wildernes: I know thy pride and the malice of thyne heart, that thou art come downe to see the battel.
{17:29} And Dauid sayde: And what haue I nowe done? is there not a cause?
{17:30} And he departed from him into the presence of another, and spake of the same maner: and the people aunswered him againe, as before.
{17:31} And they that heard the wordes which Dauid spake, rehearsed them before Saul, which caused him to be fet.
{17:32} And Dauid sayde to Saul: Let no mans heart fayle him because of him: Thy seruaunt will go, and fight with yonder Philistine.
{17:33} And Saul sayde to Dauid againe: Thou art not able to go against yonder Philistine, to fight with him: For thou art but a childe, but he is a man of warre euen from his youth.
{17:34} Dauid aunswered vnto Saul: Thy seruaunt kept his fathers sheepe, & ther came a lion and likewise a beare, and toke a sheepe, out of the flocke:
{17:35} And I went out after him, and smote him, and toke it out of his mouth: And whe he arose against me, I caught him by the bearde, and smote him, and slue him.
{17:36} And so thy seruaunte slue both the lion, and the beare: And trulie this vncircumcised Philistine shalbe as one of them, seing he hath rayled on the hoast of the liuyng God.
{17:37} And Dauid spake moreouer: The Lord that deliuered me out of the hand of the lion, and out of the hande of the beare, he shal deliuer me also out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul sayd vnto Dauid: Go, and the Lorde shall be with thee.
{17:38} And Saul put his rayment vpon Dauid, and put an helmet of brasse vpon his head, and put a coate of mayle vpon him.
{17:39} And gyrded Dauid with his owne sword vpon his rayment, and he assayed to go, and because he neuer proued it, Dauid saide vnto Saul: I cannot go with these, for I haue not vsed my selfe thereto. And Dauid put them of him,
{17:40} And toke his staffe in his hand, and chose him fiue smoth stones out of a brooke, and put them in a shepheardes bagge which he had, that is in a scrippe, and his sling was in his hande, and he went to the Philistine.
{17:41} And the Philistine came and drewe neare against Dauid, and the man that bare the shielde went before him.
{17:42} And when the Philistine loked about & sawe Dauid, he disdayned him: for he was but young, ruddie & of a comly face.
{17:43} And the Philistine sayd vnto Dauid: Am I a dogge, that thou commest to me with staues? And the Philistine cursed Dauid in ye name of his goddes.
{17:44} And the Philistine sayde to Dauid: Come to me, and I wyll geue thy fleshe vnto the foules of the ayre, and to the beastes of the fielde.
{17:45} Then sayde Dauid to the Philistine: Thou commest to me with a sword, a speare, & a shielde: But I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hoastes, the God of the hoast of Israel, whom thou hast rayled vpon.
{17:46} This day shal the Lorde close thee into my hand, and I shall smite thee, & take thyne head from thee, & will geue the carkases of the hoast of the Philistines this daye vnto the foules of the ayre, & to the beastes of the earth, that all they which be in the worlde, maye knowe that there is a God in Israel:
{17:47} And all this congregation shal know that the Lorde saueth not with sword, & speare (For the battaile is ye Lordes) and he shall geue you into our handes.
{17:48} And when the Philistine arose to come and drawe nye to Dauid, Dauid hasted, and ran to fight against the Philistine,
{17:49} And Dauid put his hand in his bagge, and toke out a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone suncke into his forehead, and he fell groueling to the earth.
{17:50} And so Dauid ouercame the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and smote the Philistine, & slue him, euen when Dauid had no sword in his hand.
{17:51} But Dauid ran and stoode vpon the Philistine, and toke his sword, and drue it out of his sheathe, & slue him, and cut of his head therewith. And when the Philistines sawe that their champion was dead, they fled.
{17:52} And the men of Israel and of Iuda arose, and showted, and folowed after the Philistines, vntill they came to the valley, and vnto the gates of Acaron: And the Philistines fell downe wounded by the way to Saaraim, euen vnto Gath, and Acaron.
{17:53} And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and spoyled their tentes.
{17:54} And Dauid toke the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Hierusalem, but he put his armour in his tent.
{17:55} When Saul sawe Dauid go foorth against the Philistine, he sayd vnto Abner the captaine of his hoast: Abner, whose sonne is this young man? Abner aunswered: As thy soule liueth (O king) I cannot tell.
{17:56} And the king sayde: Enquire thou whose sonne the youngling is.
{17:57} And whe Dauid was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner toke him, & brought him before Saul, with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
{17:58} And Saul sayde to him: whose sonne art thou, thou young man? Dauid aunswered: I am the sonne of thy seruaunt Isai the Bethlehemite.
{18:1} And whe he had made an end of speaking vnto Saul, the soule of Ionathan was knit with the soule of Dauid, and Ionathan loued him as his owne soule.
{18:2} And Saul toke him that daye, and woulde let him go no more home to his fathers house.
{18:3} Then Ionathan and Dauid made a couenaunt, because he loued him as his owne soule.
{18:4} And Ionathan put of the robe that was vpon him, and gaue it to Dauid, and thereto his garmentes, euen to his sword, and to his bowe, and to his gyrdel.
{18:5} And Dauid went out whythersoeuer Saul sent him, and behaued him selfe wysely: And Saul set hym ouer his men of warre, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, & in the sight of Sauls seruauntes.
{18:6} And as they came againe when Dauid was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dausing, to meete king Saul, with timbrels, with ioy, and with instrumentes of musicke.
{18:7} And the women aunswered one another in their play, and sayde: Saul hath slaine his thousand, and Dauid his ten thousand.
{18:8} And Saul was exceeding wroth, and the saying displeased him, and he sayd: They haue ascribed vnto Dauid ten thousand, & to me but a thousande: and what can he more haue, saue the kingdome?
{18:9} Wherfore Saul had an eye on Dauid from that day forwarde.
{18:10} And on the morow, the euyll spirite sent of God came vpon Saul, and he prophesied in the middes of ye house: And Dauid played with his hand, like as at other tymes: & there was a iauelyn in Sauls hand.
{18:11} And Saul toke the iauelyn, and sayd: I will nayle Dauid to the wall with it. And Dauid auoyded out of his presence two times.
{18:12} And Saul was afrayde of Dauid, because the Lorde was with him, & was departed from Saul.
{18:13} Therefore Saul put him from him, and made him a captaine ouer a thousand, and he went out and in before the people.
{18:14} And Dauid behaued him selfe wisely in all his wayes, and the Lorde was with him.
{18:15} Wherefore when Saul sawe that he was so exceeding wise, he was afrayde of him.
{18:16} But all Israel and Iuda loued Dauid, because he went out and in before them.
{18:17} And Saul sayde to Dauid: Beholde my eldest daughter Merob, her I will geue thee to wife: Onely be a valiaunt sonne vnto me, & fight the Lordes battayles. For Saul thought: Mine hand shall not be vpon him, but the hande of the Philistines shalbe vpon him.
{18:18} And Dauid aunswered Saul: What am I? and what is my lyfe or the kynred of my father in Israel, that I should be sonne in lawe to the king?
{18:19} Howbeit, when the time was come that Merob Sauls daughter shoulde haue ben geuen to Dauid, she was geue vnto Adriel a Meholathite, to wife.
{18:20} Howbeit, Michol Sauls daughter loued Dauid: and they shewed Saul, and the thing pleased him.
{18:21} And Saul sayde: I will geue him her that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul sayde to Dauid: Thou shalt this day be my sonne in lawe in the one of the twayne.
{18:22} And Saul comaunded his seruautes to come with Dauid secretely, & to say: Behold, the king hath a fauour to thee, and all his seruautes loue thee: be now therefore the kinges sonne in lawe.
{18:23} And Sauls seruauntes spake those wordes in the eares of Dauid. And Dauid said: semeth it to you a light thing to be a kinges sonne in lawe? seeing that I am a poore man, and of smal reputation.
{18:24} And the seruauntes brought Saul word againe, saying: Of this maner spake Dauid.
{18:25} And Saul sayde, This wise shall ye saye to Dauid: The king careth for no other dowry, but for an hundred foreskinnes of the Philistines, to be auenged of the kynges enemies. But Saul thought to make Dauid fall into the handes of the Philistines.
{18:26} And when his seruauntes tolde Dauid these wordes, it pleased Dauid wel to be the kinges sonne in lawe: And the dayes were not expired.
{18:27} Afterward Dauid arose with his men, and went and slue of the Philistines two hundred men, and Dauid brought their foreskinnes, and they gaue them wholly to the king, that he might be the kinges sonne in lawe: Wherefore Saul gaue him Michol his daughter to wife.
{18:28} And Saul saw and vnderstoode how that the Lorde was with Dauid, and that Michol his daughter loued him:
{18:29} And he was the more afrayde of Dauid, and Saul became alway Dauids enemie.
{18:30} The Lordes of the Philistines vsed to go foorth, and whe they went foorth Dauid behaued him selfe more wysely then all the seruauntes of Saul, so that his name was much set by.
{19:1} Saul spake to Ionatha his sonne, and to all his seruauntes, that they should kill Dauid.
{19:2} But Ionatha Sauls sonne had a great fauour to Dauid, & Ionathan tolde Dauid, saying, Saul my father goeth about to slay thee: Nowe therfore I pray thee take heede to thy selfe vntyll the mornyng, and abyde in some secrete place, and hyde thy selfe:
{19:3} And I wyll go out, and stande by my father in the fielde where thou art, and wyll commune with my father of thee, and whatsoeuer I see, I wyll tell thee.
{19:4} And Ionathan spake good of Dauid vnto Saul his father, and sayde vnto him: Let not the king sinne against his seruaunt, against Dauid: for he hath not sinned against thee, and his workes haue ben to theewarde very good.
{19:5} For he dyd put his life in his hande, and slue the Philistine, and the Lorde brought to passe a great health for all Israel: Thou sawest it, and thou reioycedst: Wherfore then wilt thou sinne against innocent blood, and slay Dauid without a cause?
{19:6} And Saul hearkened vnto the voyce of Ionathan, and Saul sware, as the Lorde lyueth he shall not dye.
{19:7} And Ionathan called Dauid, & Ionathan shewed hym all those wordes: & Ionathan brought Dauid to Saul, & he was in his presence as in tymes past.
{19:8} And the warre began againe, and Dauid went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slue them with a great slaughter, and they fled from hym.
{19:9} And the euyl spirite of the Lorde was vpon Saul as he sate in his house, hauing a iauelin in his hand: And Dauid played with his hand.
{19:10} And Saul entended to smyte Dauid to the wall with the iauelyn: But he ryd him selfe out of Sauls presence, as he smote the speare into the walle: And Dauid fled & was saued the same night.
{19:11} Saul also sent messengers vnto Dauids house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: And Michol Dauids wyfe tolde it him, saying: If thou saue not thy selfe this night, to morowe thou shalt be slayne.
{19:12} And so Michol let Dauid downe through a windowe: and he went and fled, and was saued.
{19:13} And Michol toke an image, and layde it in the bed, & put a pillowe stuffed with goates heere vnder the head of it, and couered it with a cloth.
{19:14} And when Saul sent messengers to fetche Dauid, she said, he is sicke.
{19:15} And Saul sent the messengers againe to see Dauid, saying: Bring him to me bed and all, that I may slay him.
{19:16} And when the messengers were come in, behold there lay an image in the bed, with a pillowe of goates heere vnder the head of it.
{19:17} And Saul sayde vnto Michol: Why hast thou mocked me so, and sent away mine enemie, that he is escaped? Michol aunswered Saul: For he sayd vnto me, let me go, or els I will kill thee.
{19:18} And so Dauid fled, and escaped, & came to Samuel to Rama, and tolde him all that Saul had done to him: And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
{19:19} And one tolde Saul, saying: Beholde, Dauid is at Naioth in Rama.
{19:20} And Saul sent messengers to fet Dauid: And when they sawe a company of prophetes prophecying, & Samuel standing as appoynted ouer them, the spirite of God fell vpon the messengers of Saul, and they prophecied to.
{19:21} And when it was tolde Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophecied lykewyse. And Saul sent messengers yet againe the third time, and they prophecied also.
{19:22} Then went he him selfe to Rama, and came to a great well that is in Sechu, and he asked and sayde: Where are Samuel & Dauid? And one sayd: Beholde, they be at Naioth in Rama.
{19:23} And he went thyther euen to Naioth in Rama, and the spirite of God came vpon him also, and he went prophecying vntill he came to Naioth in Rama.
{19:24} And he stript of his clothes & prophecied before Samuel in lyke maner, and fell naked al that day and all that night: And therof it is that they say, Is Saul also among the prophetes?
{20:1} And Dauid fled from Naioth whiche is in Rama, and came, and said before Ionathan, What haue I done? wherin am I faultie? what is the sinne that I haue committed before thy father, that he seketh my lyfe?
{20:2} He sayde vnto him: God forbid, thou shalt not dye: Behold, my father wil do nothing either great or smal, but that he will shewe it me: And howe should my father hyde this thing from me? He will not do it.
{20:3} And Dauid sware againe, and sayde: Thy father knoweth that I haue found grace in thyne eyes, & therfore he thinketh, Ionathan shall not knowe it, lest he be sory: And in very deede, euen as the Lorde lyueth, and as thy soule liueth, there is but a steppe betweene me and death.
{20:4} Then sayde Ionathan vnto Dauid: Whatsoeuer thy soule desireth, that I will do vnto thee.
{20:5} And Dauid sayd vnto Ionathan: Beholde, to morowe is the beginning of the moneth, and I should sit with the king at meate: But let me go, that I may hide my selfe in the fieldes vnto the thirde day at euen.
{20:6} If thy father speake of me, then say: Dauid asked leaue of me, that he might go to Bethlehem to his owne citie, for there is holden a yerely feast for all the kinred.
{20:7} And if he say it is well done, then thy seruaunt shal haue peace: But and if he be angry, then be sure that wickednesse is vtterly concluded of him.
{20:8} And then thou shalt shewe mercy vnto thy seruaunt for thou hast ioyned thy seruaunt into a couenant of the Lord with thee: Notwithstandyng, if there be in me iniquitie, slay me thy selfe? for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?
{20:9} And Ionathan aunswered, God kepe that from thee: For if I knewe that wickednesse were concluded of my fathere to come vpon thee, woulde not I tel it thee?
{20:10} Then sayd Dauid to Ionathan: Who shall tell me? how shall I knowe if thy father aunswere thee cruelly?
{20:11} And Ionathan sayde vnto Dauid: Come, and let vs go out into the fielde. And they went out both of them into the fielde.
{20:12} And Ionathan sayde vnto Dauid: O Lorde God of Israel, when I haue groped my fathers mynd, as this time to morowe, or within these three dayes, and if it be wel with Dauid, and I then sende not vnto thee, and shew it thee:
{20:13} The Lord do so and muche more vnto Ionathan, But if my father haue pleasure to do thee euyll, I will shewe thee also, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace, and the Lorde be with thee, as he hath ben with my father.
{20:14} And I require not whiles I liue, for I dout not but thou wilt shewe me the mercie of the Lord, that I die not:
{20:15} But I require that thou cut not of thy mercy from my house for euer, no not when the Lord hath destroyed the enemies of Dauid, euery one from the face of the earth.
{20:16} And so Ionathan made a bonde with the house of Dauid, saying: Let the lord require it at the handes of Dauids enemies.
{20:17} And Ionathan sware againe vnto Dauid, because he loued him (For he loued him as his owne soule)
{20:18} Then sayde Ionathan to Dauid: To morowe is the first day of the moone, and thou shalt be missed, because the place where thou wast wont to sit, shall be emptie.
{20:19} Therfore thou shalt hyde thy self three dayes, then thou shalt go downe quickly, and come to the place where thou diddest hyde thy selfe when the busines was in hande, and shalt remayne by the stone Esel.
{20:20} And I wil shoote three arowes on the syde therof, as though I shot them at a marke,
{20:21} And I wil sende a lad, and byd him go seke the arrowes. And if I say vnto the lad, See, the arrowes are on this side thee, bring them: then come thou, for it is peace and no hurt, as the Lorde lyueth:
{20:22} But and if I say vnto the lad, behold the arows are beyond thee, go thy way, for the Lorde hath sent thee away.
{20:23} And as touching this which thou and I haue spoken, behold the Lorde be betweene thee and me for euer.
{20:24} And so Dauid hid him selfe in the fielde: And when the newe moone was come, the king sate him downe to eate meate.
{20:25} And the king sate as at other times vpon his seate, euen vpon his seate by the wall: And Ionathan arose, and Abner sate by Sauls syde, and Dauids place was emptie.
{20:26} Neuerthelesse, Saul sayde nothing at all that day: For he thought, Some thing hath befallen him, though he were cleane.
{20:27} But on the morowe, whiche was the second day of the newe moone, Dauids place was emptie againe: And Saul sayde vnto Ionathan his sonne, Wherfore commeth not that sonne of Isai to meate, neither yesterday nor to day?
{20:28} And Ionathan aunswered vnto Saul: Dauid asked licence of me to go to Bethlehem.
{20:29} For he sayd: Let me go I pray thee, for our kinred doth hold an offering in the citie, and my brother hath sent for me: and therfore if I haue found fauour in thyne eyes, let me go I pray thee, and see my brethren. This is the cause that he commeth not vnto the kinges table.
{20:30} Then was Saul angry with Ionathan, and sayd vnto him: Thou sonne of the wicked rebellious woman, do not I knowe that thou hast chosen the sonne of Isai vnto thyne owne rebuke, and vnto the rebuke and shame of thy mother?
{20:31} For as long as the sonne of Isai liueth vpon the earth, thou shalt not be stablished, nor yet thy kingdome: Wherfore nowe send and fet him vnto me, for he is the childe of death.
{20:32} And Ionathan aunswered vnto Saul his father, and sayde to him: Wherfore should he dye? what hath he done?
{20:33} And Saul lift vp a speare to hit him, wherby Ionathan wist well that it was vtterly determined of his father to slay Dauid.
{20:34} And so Ionathan arose from the table in a great anger, and did eate no meate the seconde day of the moneth: for he was sory for Dauid, because his father had done him shame.
{20:35} On the next morning, Ionathan went out into the fielde, at ye time appoynted with Dauid, and a litle lad with him.
{20:36} And he sayde vnto his boy: Runne, and seke out myne arrowes whiche I shote. And as the boy ran, he shot an arrowe beyond him.
{20:37} And when the lad was come to the place whyther Ionathan had shot the arrowe, Ionathan cryed after the lad, & sayd: Is not the arrowe beyond there?
{20:38} And Ionathan cried after the lad againe: Make speede, haste, & stand not still. And Ionathans lad gathered vp the arrowes, and came to his maister.
{20:39} But the lad wist nothing of the matter, only Ionathan an Dauid wist it.
{20:40} And Ionathan gaue his instrumetes vnto the lad that was with him, and sayd vnto him: Go, and carry them to the towne.
{20:41} And assoone as the lad was gone, Dauid arose out of a place that was towarde the south, & fel on his face to the ground, & bowed him selfe three times, And they kissed either other, and wept together, so long till Dauid exceeded.
{20:42} And Ionathan sayd to Dauid, Go in peace: And the thinges which we haue sworne both of vs in ye name of the lord, saying, the Lord be betweene thee & me, and betweene thy sede & myne: let them stand for euer. And he arose, & departed: And Ionathan went into the towne.
{21:1} Then came Dauid to Nob to Ahimelech the priest, and Ahimelech was astonied at the meeting of Dauid, & sayd vnto him: Why art thou alone and no man with thee?
{21:2} And Dauid said to Ahimelech the priest: The king hath commaunded me a certaine thing, and hath sayd vnto me, Let no man know wher about I send thee, and what I haue commaunded thee: And I haue appoynted my seruauntes to suche and suche places.
{21:3} Nowe therfore if thou hast ought vnder thyne hand, geue me fyue loaues of bread, or what commeth to hande.
{21:4} And the priest aunswered Dauid, and sayd: There is no common bread vnder myne hand, but here is halowed bread: if the young me haue kept them selues, specially from women.
{21:5} Dauid aunswered the priest, and sayd vnto him: Of a trueth, women hath ben separated fro vs this two or three days since I came out, & the vessels of the young men were holy: Howebeit, this way is vnpure, and howe muche more shall there be holines in the vessell?
{21:6} And so the priest gaue him halowed bread: for there was none other bread there, saue the shew bread that was taken from before the Lord, to put freshe bread there the day that it was taken away.
{21:7} (And there was there the same day a certaine man, of the seruautes of Saul, abyding before ye Lord, named Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of Sauls heardmen.)
{21:8} And Dauid sayd vnto Ahimelech: Is not here vnder thyne hand either speare or sworde? for I haue neither brought my sword nor my harnesse with me, because the kinges busines required haste.
{21:9} And the priest sayd: The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou sluest in the valley of Elah, beholde it is here wrapt in a cloth behind the Ephod: If thou wilt take that, take it: for ther is no other saue that here. And Dauid sayd: There is none to that, geue it me.
{21:10} And Dauid arose, & fled the same day from the presence of Saul, and went to Achis the king of Gath.
{21:11} And the seruauntes of Achis sayde vnto him: Is not this Dauid the king of the land? Dyd they not sing vnto him in daunses, saying: Saul hath slayne his thousand, and Dauid his ten thousand?
{21:12} And Dauid put those wordes into his heart, & was sore afrayde of Achis the king of Gath.
{21:13} And he chaunged his speache before them, and fained him selfe mad in their handes, and scrabled on the doores of the gate, and let his spettell fall downe vpon his beard.
{21:14} Then sayd Achis vnto his seruauntes: Lo, ye see that this man is besyde him selfe, wherfore then haue ye brought him to me?
{21:15} Haue I neede of mad men, that ye haue brought this felowe to play the mad man in my presence? Shall he come into my house?
{22:1} Dauid therfore departed thence, & escaped to the caue Adullam: Whe his brethren also & his fathers house heard it, they went downe thyther to him.
{22:2} And there gathered vnto him all men that were in combraunce, and in det, and troubled in their mindes, & he became a captayne ouer them: And there were with him vpon a foure hundred men.
{22:3} And Dauid went thence to Mispah in the land of Moab, and sayde vnto the king of Moab: Let my father and my mother (I pray thee) come foorth vnto you, till I knowe what God wyl do for me.
{22:4} And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the whyle that Dauid kept him selfe in the holde.
{22:5} And the prophete Gad sayde vnto Dauid: Abyde not in the hold, but depart & go into the land of Iuda. Then Dauid departed, & came into the forest Hareth.
{22:6} And Saul hearde that Dauid was discouered, and also the men that were with him: and Saul sat in Gibea vnder a tree in Rama, hauing his speare in his hande, and all his men stoode about him.
{22:7} And Saul sayde vnto his seruauntes that stoode about him, Heare I pray you, ye sonnes of Iemini: will ye sonne of Isai geue euery one of you fieldes and vineyardes, and make you all captaines ouer thousandes and ouer hundredes,
{22:8} That ye haue also conspired agaynst me, & there is none that telleth me that my sonne hath made a couenaunt with the sonne of Isai, and there is none of you yt is sory for me, or sheweth me that my sonne hath stirred vp my seruaunt to lye in wayte agaynst me as appeareth this day?
{22:9} Then aunswered Doeg the Edomite (which was appoynted by ye seruauntes of Saul) and sayd: I sawe the sonne of Isai, when he came to Nob to Ahimelech the sonne of Ahitob,
{22:10} Whiche asked councel of the Lorde for him, and gaue him vittayles, and the sword of Goliath the Philistine also.
{22:11} Then the king sent and called for Ahimelech the priest the sonne of Ahitob, & all his fathers house that is to saye the priestes that were in Nob: And they came all to the king.
{22:12} And Saul sayde: Heare nowe thou sonne of Ahitob. He aunswered: Here I am, my lorde.
{22:13} And Saul sayde vnto him: Why haue ye conspired agaynst me, thou, and the sonne of Isai, in that thou hast geuen him vittayle, and a sworde, and hast asked councel of God for him, yt he shoulde aryse against me, and lye in waite for me as appeareth this day?
{22:14} Ahimelech aunswered the king, and sayde: Who is so faithfull among all thy seruauntes, as Dauid, and therto the kinges sonne in lawe: and goeth at thy bidding, and is had in honour in thyne house?
{22:15} Haue I this day begun first to aske councell of God for him? That be farre from me: Let not the king impute any thing vnto his seruaut, nor to all ye house of my father: For thy seruaunt knewe nothing of all this, either lesse or more.
{22:16} The king sayde, Thou shalt surely die Ahimelech, thou, & al thy fathers house.
{22:17} And the king sayde vnto the footemen that stoode about him: Turne, and slay the priestes of the Lorde: both because their hand is with Dauid, and because they knewe when Dauid fled, and shewed it not to me. But the seruauntes of the king would not moue their hades to fal vpon the priestes of the Lorde.
{22:18} And the king sayde to Doeg: Turne thou, & fall vpon the priestes. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and ranne vpon the priestes, & slue that same day fourescore and fiue persons that did weare a linnen Ephod.
{22:19} And Nob the citie of ye priestes, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklinges, oxen and asses, & sheepe, with the edge of the sworde.
{22:20} And one of the sonnes of Ahimelech the sonne of Ahitob, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled to Dauid.
{22:21} And Abiathar shewed Dauid howe that Daul had slayne ye Lordes priestes.
{22:22} And Dauid sayde vnto Abiathar: I wist it the same day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would tel Saul: and I am cause of the death of all the persons of thy fathers house.
{22:23} Abyde thou with me, and feare not: For he that seketh my lyfe, he shall seke thine also, with me thou shalt be in safegarde.
{23:1} Then they tolde Dauid, saying: Beholde, the Philistines fight against Keila, and spoyle the barnes.
{23:2} Therfore Dauid asked counsell of the lord, saying: Shal I go and smyte these Philistines? And the Lord aunswered vnto Dauid: Go, and smite the Philistines, and saue Keila.
{23:3} And Dauids men said vnto him, See, we be afrayde here in Iuda: howe much more then if we come to Keila against the hoast of the Philistines?
{23:4} Then Dauid asked counsell of the Lorde agayne. And the Lorde aunswered him, and sayd: Aryse, and go downe to Keila, for I will deliuer the Philistines into thyne hande.
{23:5} And so Dauid and his men went to Keila, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattell, & smote them with a great slaughter, and so Dauid saued ye inhabitauntes of Keila.
{23:6} And when Abiathar the sonne of Ahimelech fled to Dauid to Keila, he brought an Ephod with him in his hande.
{23:7} And it was tolde Saul that Dauid was come to Keila: And Saul sayde, God hath deliuered him into myne hande: For he is shut in, now that he is come into a towne that hath gates and barres.
{23:8} And Saul called all the people together to warre, for to go downe to Keila, and to besiege Dauid and his men.
{23:9} And Dauid hauing knowledge that Saul imagined mischiefe agaynst him, sayde to Abiathar the priest: Bring the Ephod.
{23:10} Then sayde Dauid: O Lorde God of Israel, thy seruaunt hath hearde that Saul is about to come to Keila to destroye the citie for my sake:
{23:11} Will the lordes of Keila deliuer me into his hande? And will Saul come downe, as thy seruaunt hath hearde, O Lorde God of Israel: I besech thee tell thy seruaunt. And the Lorde sayde: He wil come downe.
{23:12} Then sayde Dauid: Will the lordes of Keila deliuer me and the men that are with me into the hand of Saul? And the Lorde sayde: They wil deliuer thee vp.
{23:13} Then Dauid, & his men, whiche were vpon a sixe hundred, arose and departed out of Keila, and went whyther they coulde: And it was tolde Saul that Dauid was fled from Keila, and he let the iourney alone.
{23:14} Dauid abode in the wildernesse in strong holdes, and remained in a mountayne in the wildernesse of Ziph: And Saul sought him euery day, but God deliuered him not into his hande.
{23:15} And Dauid sawe that Saul was come out to seke his lyfe: And Dauid was in the wildernesse of Ziph in the wood.
{23:16} And Ionathan Sauls sonne arose and went to Dauid into the wood, and comforted his hande in God,
{23:17} And sayd vnto him: Feare not, for the hand of Saul my father shall not finde thee, & thou shalt be king ouer Israel, and I shall be next vnto thee: and that doeth Saul my father knowe.
{23:18} And they made a bond both of them together before the Lorde: And Dauid taried still in the wood, and Ionathan went to his house.
{23:19} Then came the Ziphites to Saul to Gibea, saying: Doth not Dauid hyde him selfe fast by vs in strong holdes, in the wood in the hill of Hachila, on the right side of Iesimon?
{23:20} Nowe therfore O king, thou mayest come downe according to all the lust of thy soule, and our part shalbe to deliuer him into the kinges hande.
{23:21} And Saul sayde: Blessed are ye in the Lord, for ye haue compassion on me:
{23:22} Go I pray you and prepare yet better, knowe and see where his foote hath ben, & who hath seene him there: for it is tolde me that he is very subtyll.
{23:23} See therfore, and know al the lurking places where he hydeth him selfe, and come ye againe to me with ye certaintie, and I wil go with you: And yf he be in the lande, I will searche him out throughout al the thousandes of Iuda.
{23:24} And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: But Dauid & his men were in the wildernesse of Maon, in the plaine that is on the right hande of Iesimon.
{23:25} Saul also and his men went to seke him: And they told Dauid, wherfore he came downe vnto a rocke, and abode in the wildernesse of Maon: And when Saul heard that, he folowed after Dauid in the wildernesse of Maon.
{23:26} And Saul and his men went on the one syde of the mountayne, and Dauid & his men on the other syde of the mountaine: And Dauid made haste to get fro the presence of Saul. For Saul and his men, compassed Dauid and his men round about, to take them.
{23:27} But ther came a messenger to Saul, saying: Haste thee and come, for the Philistines haue inuaded the lande.
{23:28} Wherfore Saul returned from persecuting Dauid, and went against the Philistines: And therfore they called that place, Sela Hamnahlekoth.
{23:29} (23:28) And Dauid went thence, and dwelt in strong holdes at Engadi.
{24:1} When Saul was come againe fro folowing after ye Philistines, there were which told him, saying: Behold, Dauid is in the wildernesse of Engadi.
{24:2} Then Saul toke three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seke Dauid and his men in the heyght of the rockes where wilde goates remayne.
{24:3} And he came to the sheepe coates by the way, where there was a caue, & Saul went in to do his easement: And Dauid and his men remayned in the inward partes of the caue.
{24:4} And the men of Dauid sayd vnto him: See, the day is come, of which the Lord sayde vnto thee, Behold I will deliuer thyne enemie into thyne hand, and thou shalt do to him as it shall seeme good in thy sight. Then Dauid arose, and cut of the lappe of Sauls garment priuily.
{24:5} And afterwarde Dauids heart smote him, because he had cut of the lap of Sauls garment.
{24:6} And he sayd vnto his men: The Lorde kepe me from doyng that thing vnto my maister the lordes annoynted to lay myne hande vpon him, seing he is the annoynted of the Lorde.
{24:7} And so Dauid kept of his seruauntes with these wordes, and suffred them not to rise against Saul: But Saul rose vp out of the caue, and went away.
{24:8} Dauid also arose afterward, and went out of the caue, and cryed after Saul, saying: My Lorde king. And when Saul loked behind him, Dauid stowped with his face to the earth, and bowed him selfe.
{24:9} And Dauid sayde to Saul: Wherfore geuest thou an eare to mens wordes that say, beholde Dauid seketh euyll against thee?
{24:10} Behold, this day thyne eyes haue seene howe that the Lord hath deliuered thee this day into myne hande in the caue: And some bad me kill thee, but I had compassion on thee, and sayd: I will not lay myne handes on my maister, for he is the Lordes annoynted.
{24:11} And moreouer my father, beholde and see yet the lap of thy garment in my hand: Inasmuch as I killed thee not when I cut of the lap of thy garment, vnderstand therfore, & see that there is neither euyll nor wickednesse in me, and that I haue not sinned against thee: And yet thou huntest after my soule to take it.
{24:12} The Lorde be iudge betweene thee and me, & the Lorde auenge me of thee: but myne hande be not vpon thee.
{24:13} According as the olde prouerbe sayeth, wickednesse proceedeth fro the wicked: But myne hande be not vpon thee.
{24:14} After whom is the king of Israel come out? After whom doest thou pursue? After a dead dog, and after a flea.
{24:15} The Lorde therfore be iudge, & iudge betweene thee & me, and see & pleade my cause, & auenge me out of thyne hande.
{24:16} When Dauid had made an ende of speaking these wordes to Saul, Saul sayde: Is this thy voyce my sonne Dauid? And Saul lift vp his voyce, and wept,
{24:17} And sayde to Dauid, Thou art more righteous then I: for thou hast rewarded me with good, where as I haue rewarded thee with euyll.
{24:18} And thou hast shewed this day, howe that thou hast dealt wel with me: forasmuch as when the Lorde had closed me in thyne handes, thou killedst me not.
{24:19} For who shall finde his enemie, and let him depart into a good way? Wherfore the Lord reward thee with good, for that thou hast done vnto me this day.
{24:20} And nowe beholde, I wote wel that thou shalt be king, & that the kingdome of Israel shalbe stablished in thyne hande:
{24:21} Swere nowe therfore vnto me by the Lorde, that thou shalt not destroy my seede after me, and that thou shalt not put my name out of my fathers house.
{24:22} And Dauid sware vnto Saul, & Saul went home: But Dauid and his men gat them vp vnto the holde.
{25:1} And Samuel died, and all the Israelites gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his owne house at Rama. And Dauid arose, & went downe to the wildernesse of Pharan.
{25:2} And ther was a man in Maon, whose possession was in Carmel, and the man was exceeding mightie, and had three thousande sheepe & a thousand goates: And he was shearing his sheepe in Carmel.
{25:3} The name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wyfe was Abigail, and she was a woman of a singuler wysedome, and beautifull: But the man was churlishe, and of shrewde conditions, & was of the kinred of Caleb.
{25:4} And Dauid hearde in the wildernesse, that Nabal did sheare his sheepe.
{25:5} And Dauid sent out ten young men, and sayd vnto them: Get you vp to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greete him in my name.
{25:6} And ye shal say: So mayest thou lyue, peace be to thee, peace be to thyne house, and peace be vnto all that thou hast.
{25:7} Beholde I haue hearde say that thou hast shearers: Nowe, thy shepheardes were with vs, & we did them no spite, neither was there ought missing vnto them al the while they were in Carmel:
{25:8} Aske thy laddes, & they will shew thee: Wherfore let these young men finde fauour in thyne eyes (for we come in a good season) & geue I pray thee whatsoeuer commeth to thyne hande vnto thy seruauntes, and to thy sonne Dauid.
{25:9} And when Dauids young men came, they told Nabal all those wordes in the name of Dauid: and helde their peace.
{25:10} And Nabal aunswered Dauids seruauntes, and said: Who is Dauid? and who is ye sonne of Isai? There is plentie of seruauntes now a dayes that breake away euery man from his maister.
{25:11} Shal I then take my bread, my water, and my fleshe that I haue killed for my shearers, and geue it vnto men whom I wot not whence they be?
{25:12} And so Dauids seruauntes turned their way, and went againe, and came and tolde him all those sayinges.
{25:13} And Dauid sayd vnto his men: Girde euery man his sword about him. And they girded euery man his sword about him, and Dauid was girded with his sword: And there folowed Dauid vpon a foure hundred men, and two hundred abode by the stuffe.
{25:14} But one of the laddes tolde Abigail Nabals wyfe, saying: Beholde, Dauid sent messengers vnto our maister out of the wildernesse to salute him: and he rayled on them.
{25:15} And yet the men were very good vnto vs, and dyd vs no displeasure, neither missed we any thyng as long as we were conuersaunt with them when we were in the fieldes.
{25:16} They were a wall vnto vs both by night and day, all the while we were with them keping sheepe.
{25:17} Now therefore take heede, & see what thou shalt do: for surelie euyll will come vpon our maister and al his housholde, for he is so wicked, that a man can not speake to him.
{25:18} Then Abigail made haste, and tooke two hundred loaues, and two bottels of wine, and fiue sheepe redie dressed, and fiue measures of parched corne, and an hundred frailes of reasynges, and two hundred cakes of fygges, & laded them on asses,
{25:19} And sayde vnto her young men: Go before me, beholde I come after you. But she tolde her husband Nabal nothing thereof.
{25:20} And as she rode on her asse, she came priuylie downe the syde of the hill, and behold Dauid and his men came downe against her, and she met them.
{25:21} And Dauid saide: Surelie in vayne haue I kept all that this felow hath in the wildernes, so that nothing was missed of all that pertayned vnto him: and he hath quite me euill for good.
{25:22} So and more also do God vnto the enemies of Dauid, if I leaue of all that pertayne to him by the dawnyng of the day, any that pysseth against the wall.
{25:23} And when Abigail sawe Dauid, she hasted and lyghted of her asse, and fell before Dauid on her face, and bowed her selfe to the grounde,
{25:24} And fell at his feete, and sayde: Let this iniquitie be counted myne my lord, and let thyne handmaide I praye thee speake in thyne audience, & heare the wordes of thy handmayd.
{25:25} Let not my lorde I pray thee regarde this wicked man Nabal: For as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, & folly is with him: But I thyne handmayd sawe not the young men of my lorde whom thou sendedst.
{25:26} Now therefore my lorde, as the Lord lyueth, and as thy soule liueth, euen the Lorde that hath withholden thee from comming to shed blood, and saued thee thyne hand: So nowe, I pray God that thyne enemies, & they that intende to do my lorde euyll, may be as Nabal.
{25:27} And now this blessing which thyne handmayd hath brought vnto my lord, let it be geuen vnto the young men that folowe my lorde.
{25:28} I praye thee forgeue the trespasse of thyne handmayd: for the Lorde will make my lord a sure house, because my lorde fighteth the battailes of the Lord, and there could none euill be found in thee in all thy dayes.
{25:29} And yet a man hath rysen to persecute thee, and to seeke thy soule: but the soule of my Lorde shall be bound in the bundel of the lyuyng with the Lord thy God, and the soules of thy enemies shall God cast out, euen as out of the middle of a slyng.
{25:30} And when the Lorde shall haue done to my lord al the good that he hath promysed thee, and shall haue made thee ruler ouer Israel:
{25:31} Then shall it be no griefe vnto thee, nor offence of mynde vnto my lorde, that thou hast not shed blood causelesse, and that my lord hath not auenged him selfe: But when the Lorde shall haue dealt well with my lord, then thinke on thyne handmayde.
{25:32} And Dauid said to Abigail: Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meete me.
{25:33} Blessed is thy saying, and blessed art thou which hast kept me this day from comming to shed blood, & from auengeing my selfe with myne owne hande.
{25:34} For in very deede, as the Lorde God of Israel lyueth, which hath kept me backe from hurting thee: except thou haddest hasted and met me, surely there hadde not ben left vnto Nabal by the dawnyng of the day, any that pysseth against the wall.
{25:35} And so Dauid receaued of her hande that which she had brought him, and sayde vnto her: Go vp in peace to thyne house, beholde I haue heard thy voyce, and haue graunted thy petition.
{25:36} And Abigail came to Nabal, and beholde, he held a feast in his house lyke the feast of a king, and Nabals heart was mery within hym, for he was very drunken: Wherfore she tolde him nothyng neither lesse nor more, vntyll the morowe mornyng.
{25:37} But in the morning when the wine was gone out of Nabal, his wyfe tolde him these wordes, and his heart dyed within him, and he became as a stone.
{25:38} And vpon a ten dayes after, the Lord smote Nabal, that he dyed.
{25:39} And when Dauid heard that Nabal was dead, he sayd: Blessed be the Lord that hath iudged ye cause of my rebuke of the hand of Nabal, & hath kept his seruaunt from euill: For the Lord hath recompenced the wickednes of Nabal vpon his owne head. And Dauid sent to commune with Abigail, to take her to his wyfe.
{25:40} And when the seruauntes of Dauid were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake vnto her, saying: Dauid sent vs vnto thee, to take thee to his wyfe.
{25:41} (25:40) And she arose, & bowed her selfe on her face to the earth, and saide: Beholde, let thy handmayd be a seruaunt, to washe the feete of the seruauntes of my lorde.
{25:42} (25:41) And Abigail hasted, and arose, & gate her vpon an Asse, with fiue damosels of hers that went at her feete, and she went after the messengers of Dauid, & became his wyfe.
{25:43} (25:42) Dauid also toke Ahinoam of Iezrael, and they were both his wyues.
{25:44} (25:43) But Saul had geuen Michol his daughter, Dauids wyfe, to Phalti the sonne of Lais, which was of Gallim.
{26:1} The Ziphites came againe vnto Saul to Gibea, saying: Doth not Dauid hide him selfe in the hill of Hachilia, which is before Iesimon?
{26:2} Saul arose, & went downe to the wildernes of Ziph, hauing three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, for to seke Dauid in the wildernesse of Ziph.
{26:3} And Saul pitched in the hil of Hachilia, which is before Iesimon by the way side: But Dauid dwelt in the wildernesse, and he sawe that Saul came after him into the wildernesse:
{26:4} Dauid therefore sent out spies, & vnderstoode that Saul was come in very deede.
{26:5} And Dauid arose, & came to the place where Saul had pitched: & Dauid beheld the place where Saul lay, & Abner the sonne of Ner which was his chiefe captayne: for Saul lay in the fort, & the people pytched rounde about him.
{26:6} Then aunswered Dauid, and spake to Ahimelech the Hethite, and to Abisai the sonne of Zaruia, & brother to Ioab, saying: Who wyll go downe with me to Saul to the hoast? And Abisai saide: I wyll go downe with thee.
{26:7} And so Dauid and Abisai came downe to the people by night, and behold Saul lay sleepyng within the fort, and his speare stacke in ye grounde at his head: but Abner and the people lay rounde about hym.
{26:8} Then saide Abisai to Dauid, God hath closed thyne enemie into thyne hand thys day: Nowe I pray thee let me smite him once with my speare to the earth, & I will not smite him the second tyme.
{26:9} And Dauid saide to Abisai, Destroye him not: For who can laye his hand on the Lordes annoynted, and be giltlesse?
{26:10} And Dauid sayd furthermore: As the Lorde lyueth, the Lorde shall smyte him or his day shall come to dye, or he shall descend into battaile, and perishe.
{26:11} The Lorde kepe me from laying myne hand vpon the Lordes annoynted: But I praye thee take thou nowe the speare that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let vs go.
{26:12} And so Dauid toke the speare and the cruse of water from Sauls head, and they gat them away, and no man sawe it, nor marked it, neither awaked: For they were all asleepe, because the Lorde had sent a dead sleepe vpon the.
{26:13} Then Dauid went ouer to the other syde, and stoode on the toppe of an hill a farre of (a great space being betweene them:)
{26:14} And Dauid cryed to the people, and to Abner the sonne of Ner, saying: Hearest thou not Abner? Abner aunswered and sayd: Who art thou that cryest to the king?
{26:15} And Dauid sayde to Abner: Art not thou a man? and who is lyke to thee in Israel? Wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lorde the king? For there came one of the folke in to destroye the king thy lorde.
{26:16} It is not well done of thee: As the Lorde lyueth, ye are worthy to dye, because ye haue not kept the Lordes annoynted: And nowe see where the kinges speare is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.
{26:17} And Saul knew Dauids voyce, and sayd: Is this thy voyce my sonne Dauid? And Dauid sayde: It is my voyce my lorde, O king.
{26:18} And he sayde: Wherefore doth my lorde thus persecute his seruaunt? for what haue I done? or what euyll is in myne hand?
{26:19} Nowe therefore I praye thee, let my lorde the king heare the wordes of his seruaunt: If the Lorde haue stirred thee vp against me, let him smell the sauour of a sacrifice: But and if they be the children of men, cursed are they before the Lorde, for they haue cast me out this day from abidyng in the inheritaunce of the Lorde, saying: Go, serue other goddes.
{26:20} Now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lorde: For the king of Israel is come out to seeke a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountaynes.
{26:21} Then saide Saul, I haue sinned: Come agayne my sonne Dauid, for I will do thee no more harme, because my soule was precious in thyne eyes this day: Beholde, I haue played the foole, and haue erred exceedinly.
{26:22} And Dauid aunswered and said: Beholde the kinges speare, let one of the young men come ouer and fet it.
{26:23} The Lorde rewarde euery man according to his righteousnes, and faythfulnesse: For the Lorde deliuered thee into my hand this day, but I would not lay mine hand vpon the Lordes annoynted.
{26:24} And behold, like as thy life was much set by this day in myne eyes: so be my lyfe set by in the eyes of the Lorde, that he deliuer me out of all tribulation.
{26:25} Then Saul saide to Dauid: Blessed art thou my sonne Dauid, for thou shalt do great thinges and preuaile. And so Dauid went his way, and Saul turned to his place agayne.
{27:1} And Dauid sayd in his heart, I shall perishe one day by the hand of Saul: therefore is there nothing better for me, then to flee and saue my self in the land of the Philistines, and Saul shall ceasse and seeke me no more in all the coastes of Israel, and so shall I escape out of his hand.
{27:2} And Dauid arose, and he and the sixe hundred men that were with him, went vnto Achis the sonne of Maoch, king of Gath.
{27:3} And Dauid dwelt with Achis at Gath, both he and his men, euery man with his housholde, and Dauid with his two wiues, Ahinoam the Iezrahelite, and Abigail Nabals wyfe the Carmelite.
{27:4} And it was tolde Saul that Dauid was fled to Gath, and he sought no more for him.
{27:5} And Dauid sayde vnto Achis: If I haue now founde grace in thyne eyes, let them geue me a place in some towne in ye countrey, that I may dwell there: For why should thy seruaunt dwell in the head citie of the kingdome with thee?
{27:6} Then Achis gaue him Ziklag that same day, for which cause Ziklag pertayneth vnto the kinges of Iuda vnto this day.
{27:7} And the tyme that Dauid dwelt in the countrey of the Philistines, was foure monethes, and certaine dayes.
{27:8} And Dauid and his men went vp and inuaded the Gesurites, the Gerzites, & the Amalekites: For those natios were from the beginnyng the inhabitauntes of the lande, as men go to Sur, vnto the land of Egypt.
{27:9} And Dauid smote the lande, & left neither man nor woman alyue, and droue away the sheepe, the oxen, the asses, camelles, and clothes, and returned, and came to Achis.
{27:10} And Achis saide: Where haue ye ben a rouing this day? And Dauid aunswered: Against the south of Iuda, and against the south of the Ierameelites, and against the south of the Kenites.
{27:11} And Dauid saued neither man nor woman alyue to bring to Gath, saying: lest they should tell on vs, saying, so dyd Dauid, and so will be his maner all the whyle he dwelleth in the countrey of the Philistines.
{27:12} And Achis beleued Dauid, saying: He hath made his people Israel vtterly to abhorre him, & therefore he shalbe my seruaunt for euer.
{28:1} And in those dayes, the Philistines gathered theyr hoast together to warre, to fight with Israel: And Achis sayd to Dauid, Be sure thou shalt go out with me to battayle, thou and the men that are with thee.
{28:2} And Dauid sayde to Achis: Surelie thou shalt knowe what thy seruaunt can do. And Achis said to Dauid: Then I will make thee keper of my head for euer.
{28:3} Samuel was then dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Rama his owne citie: And Saul had put away the sorcerers, and the soothsayers out of the land.
{28:4} And the Philistines gathered together, and came, and pytched in Sunem: And Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pytched in Gilboa.
{28:5} And when Saul sawe the hoast of the Philistines, he was afrayde, & his heart was sore astonied.
{28:6} And when Saul asked councell of the Lorde, the Lorde aunswered him not, neither by dreames, nor by Urim, nor yet by prophetes.
{28:7} Then sayd Saul vnto his seruautes: Seeke me a woman that hath a familier spirite, that I may go to her, and aske of her. And his seruauntes sayd to him: Beholde, there is a woman that hath a familier spirite at Endor.
{28:8} And Saul chaunged him selfe, and put on other rayment, and then went he & two men with him, and they came to the woman by nyght, and he sayde: I pray thee coniecture vnto me by the familier spirite, & bring me him vp whom I shall name vnto thee.
{28:9} And the woman saide vnto him: Beholde, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath destroyed the sorcerers, and the soothsayers out of the land: Wherfore then layest thou a snare for my soule, to cause me to die?
{28:10} And Saul sware to her by the Lord, saying: As the Lorde lyueth, there shall no harme come to thee for this thyng.
{28:11} Then saide the woman: Whom shall I fetch vp vnto thee? He aunswered: Bring me vp Samuel.
{28:12} When the woman sawe Samuel, she cryed with a loude voyce, and spake to Saul, saying: Why hast thou deceaued me? for thou art Saul.
{28:13} And the king saide vnto her: Be not afrayd: What sawest thou? The woman saide vnto Saul: I sawe gods ascending vp out of the earth.
{28:14} He saide vnto her againe: What fashion is he of? She aunswered: There cometh vp an olde man with a mantel vpon him. And Saul perceaued that it was Samuel, and he stowped with his face to the ground, and bowed him selfe.
{28:15} And Samuel said to Saul: Why hast thou vnquieted me, to make me be brought vp? Saul aunswered: I am sore encumbred, for ye Philistines make warre against me, and God is departed from me, and aunswereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreames: And therefore I haue called thee, that thou mayest tell me what I shall do.
{28:16} Then saide Samuel: Wherefore doest thou aske of me, while the Lord is gone from thee, and is become thyne enemie?
{28:17} Trulie the Lord hath done to him, euen as he spake by my hand: For the Lorde hath rent the kingdome out of thyne hand, and geuen it thy neyghbour Dauid.
{28:18} Because thou obeyedst not the voyce of the Lorde, nor executedst his fierce wrath vpon the Amalekites, therefore hath the Lord done this vnto thee this day.
{28:19} And moreouer, the Lord will deliuer Israel with thee into the handes of the Philistines: To morrowe shalt thou and thy sonnes be with me, and the Lorde shall geue the hoast of Israel into the handes of the Philistines.
{28:20} Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afrayde because of the wordes of Samuel. And there was no strength in him: for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
{28:21} And the woman came vnto Saul, & sawe that he was sore troubled, & sayde vnto him: See, thyne handmayde hath obeyed thy voyce, & haue put my soule in my hand, and haue hearkened vnto thy wordes which thou sayedst vnto me.
{28:22} Nowe therefore I pray thee hearken thou also vnto the voyce of thyne handmayde, and let me set a morsell of bread before thee, that thou mayest eate, and get thee strength, & then go on thy iourney.
{28:23} He refused, and sayde: I will not eate. But his seruauntes and the woman together compelled him, and he hearkened vnto their voyce: And so he arose from the earth, and sat on a bed.
{28:24} The woman had a fat calfe in the house, and she hasted and killed it, and tooke floure and kneded it, and did bake vnleauened bread thereof:
{28:25} And brought them before Saul, and before his seruauntes: And when they had eaten, they stoode vp, & went away the same night.
{29:1} So the Philistines were gathered together with all their armies in Aphec: and the Israelites pytched by Ain, which is in Iezrael.
{29:2} And the princes of the Philistines went foorth by hundreds and thousandes: But Dauid and his men came behinde with Achis.
{29:3} The sayd the princes of the Philistines, what do these Ebrues here? Achis said vnto the princes of the Philistines: Is not this Dauid, the seruaunt of Saul the king of Israel, which hath ben with me these dayes, or these yeres, and I haue found no fault in him, since he fell vnto me, vnto this day?
{29:4} And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with hym, and the princes of the Philistines sayde vnto hym: Make this felowe returne, that he may go againe to his place which thou hast appoynted hym, and let hym not go downe with vs to battayle, lest in the battayle he be an aduersarie to vs: For wherewith shoulde he obtayne the fauour of his maister? shoulde it not be with the heades of these men?
{29:5} Is not this Dauid, to whom they sang in daunces, saying: Saul slue his thousande, & Dauid his ten thousande?
{29:6} Then Achis called Dauid, and sayde vnto him: As the Lorde lyueth, thou hast ben honest, and good in my sight, when thou wentest out and in with me in the hoast, neither haue I founde euyll with thee sence thou camest to me, vnto this day: Neuerthelesse, the princes fauour thee not.
{29:7} Wherefore nowe returne, and go in peace, that thou displease not the princes of the Philistines.
{29:8} And Dauid sayde vnto Achis: And what haue I done? what hast thou founde in thy seruaunt as long as I haue ben with thee vnto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lorde the king?
{29:9} Achis aunswered and sayd to Dauid: I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angell of God: Notwithstanding, the princes of the Philistines haue sayde, Let him not go vp with vs to battaile.
{29:10} Wherefore now ryse vp earlie in the morning with thy maisters seruautes that are come to thee: and whe ye be vp earlie, assoone as ye haue lyght, departe.
{29:11} And so Dauid & his men rose vp earlie, to depart in the morning, and to returne into the land of the Philistines: And the Philistines wet vp to Iezrael.
{30:1} But when Dauid and his men were come to Ziklag the third day, the Amalekites had inuaded vppon the south, euen vnto Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burnt it with fyre.
{30:2} And had taken the women that were therein prisoners, both small and great: but slue not a man, saue carryed them away, and went their wayes.
{30:3} So Dauid and his men came to the citie, and beholde it was burnt with fyre: and their wiues, their sonnes, and their daughters were taken prisoners.
{30:4} Then Dauid & the people that were with him, lift vp their voyces and wept, vntill they could weepe no more.
{30:5} And Dauids two wiues were taken prisoners also, Ahinoam the Iezrahelite, and Abigail the wyfe of Nabal the Carmelite.
{30:6} And Dauid was in great cumbraunce: For the people entended to stone him, because the heartes of all ye people were vexed euery man for his sonnes and for his daughters: But Dauid toke a good courage to him in the Lorde his God,
{30:7} And sayde to Abiathar the priest Ahimelechs sonne: I pray thee, bring me the Ephod. And Abiathar brought the Ephod to Dauid.
{30:8} And Dauid asked councel at the Lord, saying: Shall I follow after this company? shall I ouertake them? And he aunswered him: Folowe, for thou shalt suerlie ouertake them, and recouer all.
{30:9} So Dauid and the sixe hundred men that were with him, went and came to the ryuer Befor, where a parte of them abode.
{30:10} But Dauid and foure hundred men folowed: (For two hundred abode behinde, being to weery to go ouer the ryuer Befor)
{30:11} And they founde an Egyptian in the fielde, and brought him to Dauid, and gaue him bread, & he did eate, and water to drinke.
{30:12} And gaue him a fewe fygges, and two clusters of reasinges: And when he had eaten, his spirite came againe to him: For he had eaten no bread nor druncke any water in three dayes and three nightes.
{30:13} And Dauid said vnto him: To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? He sayd: I am a young man of Egypt, and seruaunt to an Amalekite, and my maister left me, because three dayes agone I fell sicke.
{30:14} We came a rouyng vpon the south of Chretus, and vpon the coast belonging to Iuda, and toward the south of Caleb, and we burnt Ziklag with fyre.
{30:15} And Dauid saide to him: Canst thou bring me to this company? And he said: Sweare vnto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliuer me into the handes of my maister, and I will bring thee to this company.
{30:16} And when he had brought him thyther, beholde they laye scattered abrode vpon all the earth, eating, and drynking, & daunsing, because of al the great praye that they had carried away out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Iuda.
{30:17} And Dauid layde vpon them from the twylight, euen vnto the euening of the next morowe: so that there escaped not a man of them, saue foure hundred young men which rode vpon cammels, and fled.
{30:18} And Dauid recouered all that the Amalekites had carryed away, and Dauid rescued his two wyues:
{30:19} So that there was nothing lacking to them, small or great, sonne or daughter, or of the spoyle of all that they had taken away, Dauid recouered them all.
{30:20} And Dauid tooke all the sheepe, and the oxen, and they draue them before his cattaile, and saide: This is Dauids pray.
{30:21} And Dauid came to the two hundred men, that were to weery for to folowe Dauid, whom they had made also to abyde at the ryuer Befor: And they came to meete Dauid & the people that were with him: And when Dauid came to the people, he saluted them.
{30:22} Then aunswered all the wicked and the vnthryftes of the men that went with Dauid, and saide: Because they went not with vs, therfore wil we geue them none of the pray that we haue recouered: But let euery man take his wife and his children, those let them carry away and departe.
{30:23} Then sayd Dauid: Ye shall not do so my brethren with that which the Lord hath geuen vs, who hath preserued vs, and delyuered the company that came against vs, into our handes.
{30:24} For who will hearke vnto you in this matter? But as his parte is that goeth downe and fighteth, so shall his parte be that tarryeth by the stuffe: they shall parte alyke.
{30:25} And so from that day forward, was that made a statute and lawe in Israel, vnto this day,
{30:26} When Dauid therefore came to Ziklag, he sent of the pray vnto the elders of Iuda and to his friendes, saying: See, there is a blessing for you of the spoyle of the enemies of the Lorde.
{30:27} He sent to them of Bethel, to them of south Ramoth, to them of Iathir,
{30:28} To them of Aroer, to them of Sephamoth, to them of Esthema,
{30:29} To them of Rachal, to them of the cities of Ierahmeel, to them of the cities of the Kenites,
{30:30} To them of Horma, to them of Chorashan, to them of Athach,
{30:31} To them that are in Hebron, and to all places where Dauid and his men were wont to haunt.
{31:1} And the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled away from the Philistines, and fell downe wounded in mount Gilboa.
{31:2} And the Philistines preassed sore vpon Saul & his sonnes, & slue Ionathan, & Abinadab, & Melchisua, Sauls sonnes.
{31:3} And when the battaile went sore against Saul, the archers with bowes found him, and he was fore afrayde of the archers.
{31:4} The said Saul vnto his harnesse bearer, Draw out thy sword, & thrust me through therewith: lest the vncircumcised come and thrust me through & mocke me. And his harnesse bearer wolde not, for he was sore afrayd: Therefore Saul toke a sword, and fell vpon it.
{31:5} And when his harnesse bearer sawe that Saul was dead, he fell lykewise vpon his sword, and dyed with him.
{31:6} And so Saul dyed, & his three sonnes, and his harnesse bearer, and al his men that same day together.
{31:7} And when the men of Israel, that were on the other syde of the valley, and they of the other syde Iordaine, sawe that the men of Israel were put to flight, and that Saul and his sonnes were dead, they left the cities, and ran away, and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
{31:8} On the morow when the Philistines were come to spoyle them that were slaine, they founde Saul and his three sonnes lying in mount Gilboa.
{31:9} And they cut of his head, and stripped him out of his harnesse, & sent into the land of ye Philistines on euery syde, that they should puplishe it in the temple of their idolles, and among the people.
{31:10} And they layed vp his harnesse in the house of Astaroth: but they hanged vp his body on the wall of Bethsan.
{31:11} When the inhabitauntes of Iabes in Gilead heard thereof, what the Philistines had done to Saul:
{31:12} They arose, as many as were strong men, and went all night, & toke the bodie of Saul, & the bodies of his sonnes, from the wall of Bethsan, and came to Iabes, and burnt them there.
{31:13} And toke their bones & buryed them vnder a tree at Iabes, & fasted seuen dayes.
