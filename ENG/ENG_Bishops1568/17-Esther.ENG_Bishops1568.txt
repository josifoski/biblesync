{1:1} It came to passe that in the dayes of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus whiche raigned from India vnto Ethiopia, ouer an hundred and twentie and seuen prouinces)
{1:2} Euen in those dayes when the king Ahasuerus sate on his seate royall, which was in Susan the chiefe citie:
{1:3} In the third yere of his raigne, he made a feast vnto all his princes & seruauntes: and the mightie men of Persia and Media, the captaynes also and rulers of his countreys were before hym.
{1:4} And he shewed the richesse and glorie of his kingdome, and the glorious worship of his greatnesse many dayes long, euen an hundred and fourescore dayes.
{1:5} And when these dayes were expired, the king made a feast vnto al the people that were in Susan the chiefe citie, both vnto great & small, seuen dayes long, in the court of the garden by the kinges palace.
{1:6} Where there hanged white, greene, and yelowe clothes, fastened with cordes of fine silke and purple, in siluer ringes, vpon pillers of marble stones: The benches also were of golde and siluer made vpon a pauement of greene, white, yelowe, and blacke marble.
{1:7} And they dranke in vessels of gold, and chaunged vessel after vessel, and royal wine in aboundaunce, according to the power of the king.
{1:8} And the drinking was by an order, none might compell: for so the king had appoynted to all the officers of his house, that they shoulde do according to euery mans pleasure.
{1:9} And the queene Uasthi made a feast also for the women in the palace of Ahasuerus.
{1:10} And on the seuenth day when the king was mery after the wine, he commaunded Nehuma, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagthan, Zethar, and Charchas, the seuen chamberlayns that did seruice in the presence of king Ahasuerus,
{1:11} To fetch the queene Uasthi with the crowne regall into the kinges presence, that he might shewe the people & princes her fairenesse: for she was beautifull.
{1:12} But the queene Uasthi would not come at the kinges worde by his chamberlaynes: Then was the king very wroth, and his indignation kindled in hym.
{1:13} And the king spake to the wyse men which knewe the times (for so was the kinges maner towardes all that knewe the lawe and the iudgementes:
{1:14} And the next vnto hym were, Carsena, Sethar, Admata, Thersis, Mares, Marsena, and Memuchan, the seuen princes of Persia and Media, whiche sawe the kinges face, and sate the first in the kingdome.)
{1:15} What, shall we do vnto the queene Uasthi according to the lawe, because she dyd not according to the worde of the king Ahasuerus whiche he commaunded by his chamberlaynes?
{1:16} And Memuchan aunswered before the king & the princes: The queene Uasthi hath not onely done euyll against the king, but also against all the princes, and against all the people that are in all the prouinces of king Ahasuerus.
{1:17} For this deede of the queene shall come abrode vnto all women, so that they shall despise their husbandes before their eyes, and shall say: The king Ahasuerus commaunded Uasthi the queene to be brought in before hym, but she woulde not come.
{1:18} And so shal the princesses in Persia and Media say lykewise this day vnto al the kinges princes when they heare of this deede of the queene: thus shal there arise to much despitefulnesse and wrath.
{1:19} If it please the king, let there go a commaundement from hym, and let it be written according to the lawes of the Persians and Medians, and not to be transgressed, that Uasthi come no more before king Ahasuerus, and let the king geue her royal estate vnto an other that is better then she.
{1:20} And when this commaundement of the king which shalbe made, is published throughout all his empire whiche is great, all women shall holde their husbandes in honour both among great and small.
{1:21} Thus saying pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the worde of Memucan.
{1:22} For he sent letters foorth into all the kinges prouinces, into euery lande according to the wryting therof, and to euery people after their language, that euery man shoulde be lorde in his owne house: and this to be published after the language of his people.
{2:1} After these actes, when the displeasure of king Ahasuerus was nowe alayed, he thought vpon Uasthi, & what she had done, & what was decreed against her.
{2:2} Then sayde the kinges seruauntes that ministred vnto hym: Let there be faire young virgins sought for the king,
{2:3} And let the king appoynt officers in all the prouinces of his empire, that they should bring together al the faire young virgins vnto Susan the head citie to the womens buylding, vnder the hande of Hegai the kinges chamberlayne that kept the women, to geue them their apparell:
{2:4} And that the mayden which pleased the king, should be queene in Uasthis steede. And this pleased the king, and he did so.
{2:5} In the citie of Susan there was a certayne Iewe, whose name was Mardocheus, the sonne of Iair, the sonne of Semei, the sonne of Cis, a man of Iemini,
{2:6} Which was caryed away from Hierusalem with the captiuitie, when Iekonia the king of Iuda was led away, whom Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon caryed thence:
{2:7} And he norished Hadassa (that is Esther) his vncles daughter: for he had neither father nor mother, and she was a faire and beautifull mayden, whom Mardocheus (when her father & mother were dead) receaued for his owne daughter.
{2:8} So when the kinges commaundement and commission was published, and many maydens were brought together into the citie of Susan vnder the hand of Hegai, Esther was brought also vnto the kinges house vnder the hande of Hegai the keper of the women.
{2:9} And the mayden pleased hym, and she founde fauour in his sight: and he caused ornamentes to be geuen her speedyly, and such thinges as belonged to her, and appoynted her seuen comely maydens out of the kinges house, & fauoured both her and her gentlewomen singularly in the house of the women.
{2:10} But Esther shewed not her people and her kinred: for Mardocheus had charged her that she shoulde not tell it.
{2:11} And Mardocheus walked euery day before the court of the womens house, that he might knowe howe Esther did, and what shoulde become of her.
{2:12} And when the appoynted time of euery mayden came that she shoulde go in to the king Ahasuerus, after that she had ben twelue monethes according to the mauer of the women (for so were the dayes of their purification accomplissed, sixe monethes with oyle of mirre, and sixe monethes with sweete odoures, and in the purifiyng of the women:
{2:13} And thus went the maydens vnto the king) whatsoeuer she required, that must be geuen her to go with her out of the womens buylding vnto the kinges palace.
{2:14} In the euening she went, and on the morowe she returned into the seconde house of the women abyding vnder the hande of Saasgaz the kinges chamberlayne, which kept the concubines: And she came in vnto the king no more, except it pleased the king to haue her, and that she were called by name.
{2:15} Nowe when the course came of Esther the daughter of Abihail, the vncle of Mardocheus (which had receaued her as his owne daughter) that she shoulde come in vnto the king, she desired nothing but what Hegai the kinges chamberlayne the keper of the women saide: And Esther found fauour in the sight of all them that loked vpon her.
{2:16} And Esther was taken vnto king Ahasuerus into his house royall, in the tenth moneth (which is the moneth Tebeth) in the seuenth yere of his raigne.
{2:17} And the king loued Esther aboue all the women, and she found grace and fauour in his sight more then all the virgins, so that he set the crowne of the kingdome vpon her head, and made her queene in steede of Uasthi.
{2:18} And the king made a great feast vnto all his princes and seruauntes, whiche feast was because of Esther, and caused the prouinces to be in quietnesse, & gaue giftes, as became the royaltie of a king.
{2:19} And when the virgins were gathered together the seconde time, Mardocheus sate in the kinges gate.
{2:20} And as yet had not Esther shewed her kinred & her people, according as Mardocheus had bidden her: for Esther dyd after the worde of Mardocheus, like as if she had ben yet vnder his gouernaunce.
{2:21} At the same time (whyle Mardocheus sate in the kinges gate) two of ye kinges chamberlaynes, Bigthan and Theres, which kept the doore, were wroth, and sought to lay their handes on the king Ahasuerus:
{2:22} Whereof also Mardocheus gat knowledge, and tolde it vnto queene Esther, and Esther certified the king therof in Mardocheus name.
{2:23} And when inquisition was made, it was founde so, and they were both hanged on tree: and it was written in the Chronicles before the king.
{3:1} After these actes, dyd king Ahasuerus promote Haman the sonne of Amadatha the Agagite, and set hym on hie, and set his seate aboue all the princes that he had with hym.
{3:2} And al the kinges seruauntes that were in the kinges gate, bowed their knees, and reuerenced Haman, for the king had so commaunded concerning hym: But Mardocheus bowed not the knee, neither dyd hym reuerence.
{3:3} Then the kinges seruauntes whiche were in the kinges gate, said vnto Mardocheus: Why transgressest thou the kinges commaundement?
{3:4} And though they spake this dayly vnto hym, yet woulde he not heare them, therfore they tolde Haman, that they might see howe Mardocheus matters woulde stande, for he had tolde them that he was a Iewe.
{3:5} And when Haman sawe that Mardocheus bowed not the knee vnto him, nor dyd reuerence vnto hym, he was full of indignation,
{3:6} And thought it to litle to lay handes onely on Mardocheus, for they had shewed him the nation of Mardocheus: wherefore he sought to destroy all the Iewes that were throughout the whole empire of Ahasuerus, and that were of the nation of Mardocheus.
{3:7} In the first moneth (that is, the moneth Nisan) in the twelfth yere of king Ahasuerus, they cast Phur, that is a lot, before Haman from day to day, and from moneth to moneth to the twelfth moneth, that is, the moneth Adar.
{3:8} And Haman sayde vnto king Ahasuerus: There is here a people scattred abrode, and dispearsed among all people in all the prouinces of thyne empire, and their lawes are diuers from all people, and do not after the kinges lawes, therefore it is not the kinges profite to suffer them after this maner.
{3:9} If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and so wyll I waye downe ten thousand talents of siluer by the handes of them that haue the charge of this busines, to bring it into the kinges treasurie.
{3:10} And the king toke his ring from his hand, & gaue it vnto Haman the sonne of Amadatha the Agagite, the Iewes enemie.
{3:11} And the king saide vnto Haman: Let the siluer be thyne, & do with that people as it pleaseth thee.
{3:12} Then were the kinges scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first moneth, & there was written according as Haman commaunded vnto all the kinges officers, and to the captaynes that were ouer euery prouince, and to the rulers of euery people in the countryes on euery side according to the writing therof, and to euery nation after their language, in the name of king Ahasuerus was it writen, and sealed with the kinges ring.
{3:13} And the letters were sent by postes into all the kinges prouinces, to roote out, to kill, and to destroy all Iewes both young and olde, children and women in one day namely vpon the thirteenth day of the twelfth moneth (which is the moneth Adar) & to spoyle the as a pray.
{3:14} This was the summe of the writing, that there should be a commaundement geuen in al prouinces, and published vnto all people, that they should be redy against the same day.
{3:15} And the postes went in all the haste according to the kinges commaundement, and in Susan the chiefe citie was the commaundement deuised: And the king and Haman sate and dranke, when in the meane time the citie of Susan was disquieted.
{4:1} When Mardocheus perceaued all that was done, he rent his clothes, and put on sackecloth with asshes, and went out into the middest of the citie, and cryed loude and lamentably,
{4:2} And came before the kinges gate: but he might not enter within the kinges gate, because he had sackcloth on.
{4:3} And in all prouinces, countries, and places, as farre as the kinges worde & commaundement extented, there was great lamentatio among the Iewes, fasting, weeping, and mourning, and many lay in sackeclothes and in asshes.
{4:4} So Esthers maydens and her chamberlaynes, came and told it her: Then was the queene exceedingly astonied, and she sent rayment that Mardocheus shoulde put on, and lay the sackcloth from him: But Mardocheus would not take them.
{4:5} Then called Esther Hathach one of the kinges chamberlaines which stoode before her, and gaue him a commaundement vnto Mardocheus, to know what it was wherefore he did so.
{4:6} So Hathach went foorth to Mardocheus, vnto the streete of the citie which was before the kinges gate:
{4:7} And Mardocheus tolde him of al that had come vnto him, & of ye summe of siluer that Haman had promised to waye downe into the kinges treasurie, because of the Iewes if he would destroy them.
{4:8} And he gaue him the copie of the kinges commaundement that was deuised at Susan to destroy them, that he might shewe it vnto Esther, and to speake to her, and charge her that she should go in vnto the king, & make her prayer and supplication vnto him for her people.
{4:9} And when Hathach came in, he tolde Esther the wordes of Mardocheus.
{4:10} And againe Esther spake vnto Hathach and commauded him to say vnto Mardocheus:
{4:11} All the kinges seruauntes, & the people in the prouinces of the king knowe, that whosoeuer commeth within the courte vnto the king, whether it be man or woman, which is not called, the comaundement is, that the same shall dye, except the king holde out the golden septer vnto him, for then he shall lyue: As for me, I haue not ben called to come in vnto the king now this thirtie dayes.
{4:12} And they certified Mardocheus of Esthers wordes.
{4:13} And Mardocheus bad say againe vnto Esther: Thinke not with thy selfe that thou shalt escape in the kinges house more then all the Iewes.
{4:14} For if thou holdest thy peace at this time, then shall the Iewes haue helpe and deliueraunce out of an other place, and thou and thy fathers house shalbe destroyed: And who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdome for this causes sake?
{4:15} Esther bad them geue Mardocheus this aunswere:
{4:16} Go thou thy way, and gather together all the Iewes that are founde at Susan, and fast ye for me, that ye eate not and drinke not in three dayes neither day nor night, I and my maydens wyll fast likewyse: and so wyll I go in to the king, which thing yet is contrary to the commaundement: and if I perishe, I perishe.
{4:17} So Mardocheus went his way, and did according to al that Esther had commaunded him.
{5:1} And on the third day it came to passe, that Esther put on her royall apparell, and stoode in the court of the kinges palace within, ouer against ye kinges house: and the king sat vpon his royall seate in the kinges palace ouer against the gate of the house.
{5:2} And when the king sawe Esther the queene standing in the court, she founde grace in his sight: And the king held out the golden scepter that was in his hand: So Esther stept foorth and touched the top of the scepter.
{5:3} Then saide the king vnto her: What wylt thou queene Esther? and what requirest thou? aske euen the halfe of the empire, and it shalbe geuen thee.
{5:4} And Esther aunswered: If it please the king, let the king and Haman come this day vnto the banket that I haue prepared for him.
{5:5} And the king saide: Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath saide. So the king and Haman came to the banket that Esther had prepared.
{5:6} And the king saide vnto Esther at the banket of wine: What is thy petition, that it may be geuen thee? And what requirest thou? If it be euen the halfe of the empire, it shall be done.
{5:7} Then aunswered Esther, and said: My petition and desire is,
{5:8} If I haue founde grace in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to geue me my petition, and to fulfil my request, then let the king and Haman come to the banket that I shall prepare for the: and so wyl I do to morowe, as the king hath saide.
{5:9} Then went Haman foorth the same day ioyfull and mery in his minde: But when the same Haman sawe Mardocheus in the kinges gate, that he stoode not vp nor moued for him, he was ful of indignation at Mardocheus.
{5:10} Neuerthelesse, Haman refrained him selfe, and when he came home he sent and called for his friendes and Zares his wyfe.
{5:11} And Haman tolde them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the thinges wherein the king had promoted him so greatly, and how that he had set him aboue the princes and seruauntes of the king.
{5:12} Haman saide moreouer: Yea, Esther the queene did let no man come in with the king vnto the bancket that she had prepared, except me: and to morowe am I bidden vnto her also with the king.
{5:13} But in all this am I not satisfied, as long as I see Mardocheus the Iewe sitting at the kinges gate.
{5:14} Then saide Zares his wyfe and all his friendes vnto him: Let them make a galous of fiftie cubites hie, and to morowe speake thou vnto the king that Mardocheus may be hanged thereon: then go thou in meryly with the king vnto the banket. And Haman was well content withall, and caused the galous to be made.
{6:1} The same night coulde not the king sleepe, and he commaunded to bring the chronicles and stories: and they were read before the king.
{6:2} Then it was founde written howe Mardocheus had tolde that Bigthana & Theres the kinges two chamberlaynes which kept the thresholdes, sought to laye handes on king Ahasuerus.
{6:3} And the king saide: What honour and dignitie hath ben geuen to Mardocheus therfore? Then saide the kinges seruautes that ministred vnto him: There is nothing at all done for him.
{6:4} And the king saide: Who is in the court? (for Haman was come into the court without before the kinges house, that he might speake vnto the king to hang Mardocheus on the tree that he had prepared for him.)
{6:5} And the kinges seruauntes saide vnto him: Beholde, Haman standeth in the court. And the king saide: let him come in.
{6:6} And when Haman came in, the king saide vnto him: what shalbe done vnto the man whom the king would faine bring vnto worship? (Haman thought in his heart: Whom desireth the king to bring vnto worship more then me?)
{6:7} And Haman aunswered the king: Let the man whom the king pleaseth to bring vnto worship, be brought hither,
{6:8} That he may be arayed with the royall garmentes which the king vseth to weare, and the horse that the king rydeth vpon, and that the crowne royall may be set vpon his head:
{6:9} And let this rayment and horse be deliuered vnder the hande of one of the kinges most noble princes, that they may aray the man withal whom the king is disposed to bring to honour, and cary him vpon the horse through the streete of the citie, and proclayme before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king pleaseth to bring to honour.
{6:10} And the king saide to Haman: Make haste, and take as thou hast saide the rayment and the horse, and do euen so vnto Mardocheus the Iewe that sitteth before the kinges gate, and let nothing faile of all that thou hast spoken.
{6:11} Then toke Haman the rayment and the horse, and arayed Mardocheus, and brought him on horsebacke through the streete of the citie, and proclaymed before him, Euen this shall it be done vnto the man whom the king is disposed to honour.
{6:12} And Mardocheus came againe to the kinges gate: but Haman gat him home in all the haste mourning, and his head couered,
{6:13} And tolde Zares his wyfe and all his friendes euery thing that had befallen him. Then saide his wise men and Zares his wyfe vnto him: If it be Mardocheus of the seede of the Iewes, before who thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not preuaile against him, but shalt surely fall before him.
{6:14} And whyle they were yet talking with him, came the kinges chamberlaynes, & caused Haman to make hast to come vnto the banket that Esther had prepared.
{7:1} And the king and Haman came to bancket with the queene Esther.
{7:2} And the king saide againe vnto Esther on the seconde day at the bancket of wine: What is thy petition queene Esther, that it may be geuen thee? And what requirest thou? if it be euen to the halfe of the empire, it shalbe done.
{7:3} And Esther the queene aunswered, and saide: If I haue found grace in thy sight O king, and if it please the king, then graunt me my lyfe at my desire, and my people for my petitions sake.
{7:4} For we are solde I and my people to be destroyed, to be slaine, and to perishe: And would God that we were solde to be bondmen and bondwomen, then would I holde my tongue: although the enemie coulde not recompence the kinges losse.
{7:5} The king Ahasuerus aunswered and saide vnto queene Esther: Who is he? And where is he, that dare presume in his minde to do after that maner?
{7:6} And Esther saide: the enemie and aduersarie is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was exceedingly afrayde before the king and the queene.
{7:7} And the king arose from the bancket and from the wine in his displeasure, and went into the palace garden: And Haman stoode vp, and besought queene Esther for his lyfe: for he saw that there was a mischiefe prepared for him of the king alreadie.
{7:8} And when the king came againe out of the palace garde into the place where they dranke wine: Haman had layde him vpon the bed that Esther sate vpon. Then saide the king: wil he force the queene also before me in the house? As soone as that worde went out of the kinges mouth, they couered Hamans face.
{7:9} And Harbona one of the chamberlaynes that stoode before the king, said: Beholde, there standeth yet a galous in Hamans house, fiftie cubites hye, which he had made for Mardocheus, that spake good for the king. Then the king saide, Hang him thereon.
{7:10} So they hanged Haman on the galous that he had made for Mardocheus: Then was the kinges wrath pacified.
{8:1} The same day did king Ahasuerus geue the house of Haman the Iewes enemie vnto queene Esther, and Mardocheus came before the king: for Esther tolde what he was vnto her.
{8:2} And the king toke of his ring which he had taken from Haman, and gaue it vnto Mardocheus. And Esther sette Mardocheus ouer the house of Haman.
{8:3} And Esther spake yet more before the king, and fel downe at his feete weping, and besought him that he would put away the wickednesse of Haman the Agagite, and his deuice that he had imagined against the Iewes.
{8:4} And the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther. Then rose Esther, and stode before the king,
{8:5} And saide: if it please the king, and if I haue founde grace in his sight, and if it be acceptable before the king, and I please him, then let it be writte, that the letters of the deuise of Haman the sonne of Hamadatha the Agagite may be called againe, which letters he wrote to destroy the Iewes which are in all the kinges prouinces.
{8:6} For how can I suffer and see the euill that shall come vnto my people? or how can I beare and loke vpon the destruction of my kindred?
{8:7} And the king Ahasuerus saide vnto queene Esther, and to Mardocheus the Iewe: Beholde, I haue geuen Esther the house of Haman, whom they haue hanged vpon a tree, because he layde hand vpon the Iewes.
{8:8} Write ye also for the Iewes as it lyketh you, in the kinges name, and seale it with the kinges ring: For the writinges that were written in the kinges name, and sealed with the kinges ring, durst no man disanul.
{8:9} Then were the kinges scribes called at the same time, euen in the thirde moneth (that is the moneth Siuan) on the three and twentie day thereof, and it was written according to all as Mardocheus commauded vnto the Iewes, and to the princes, to the debuties and captaynes in the prouinces which are from India vnto Ethiopia, namely an hundred twentie and seuen prouinces, vnto euery prouince according to the writing thereof, and vnto euery people after their speach, and to the Iewes according to their writing and language.
{8:10} And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus name, & sealed it with the kinges ring, and by postes that rode vpon horses, and swyft young Mules, sent he the writinges,
{8:11} Wherin the king graunted the Iewes in what cities soeuer they were, to gather themselues together, and to stand for their lyfe, and for to roote out, to slay and to destroy all the power of the people and prouince that woulde trouble them, both children and women, and to spoyle their goodes:
{8:12} Upon one day in all the prouinces of king Ahasuerus, namely vpon the thirteenth day of the twelfth moneth, which is the moneth Adar.
{8:13} The summe of the writing was, how there shoulde be a commaundement geuen in all and euery prouince, and published among all people, and that the Iewes should be redy against that day, to auenge them selues on their enemies.
{8:14} And so the postes that rode vpon the swyft Horses and Mules, made haste with all speede to execute the kinges word: and the commaundement was deuised in Susan the chiefe citie.
{8:15} And Mardocheus went out from the king in royall apparell, of yelowe and white, & with a great crowne of golde, being arayed with a garment of silke and purple: and the citie of Susan reioysed and was glad.
{8:16} And vnto the Iewes there was come light and gladnesse, ioy and worship.
{8:17} In all prouinces and cities into what places soeuer the kinges word and commaundement reached, there was ioy and mirth, a feaste and good dayes among the Iewes: insomuch, that many of the people in ye lande became Iewes, for the feare of the Iewes came vpon them.
{9:1} In the twelfth moneth (that is the moneth Adar) vpo the thirteenth day of the same, when the kinges worde and commaundement drue neare to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Iewes hoped to haue power ouer the, it turned contrary: for the Iewes had rule ouer them that hated them.
{9:2} For then gathered the Iewes together in their cities within all the prouinces of king Ahasuerus, to lay hande on such as woulde do them euill, and no man could withstand them: for the feare of them was come ouer all people.
{9:3} And all the rulers in the prouinces, and princes, and deputies, and officers of the king, promoted the Iewes: for the feare of Mardocheus came vpon them.
{9:4} For Mardocheus was great in the kinges house, & the reporte of him was noysed in all the prouinces: for this man Mardocheus waxed greater and greater.
{9:5} Thus the Iewes smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, & did what they would vnto their enemies.
{9:6} And at Susan the chiefe citie slue the Iewes, & destroyed fiue hundred men.
{9:7} And slue Pharsandatha, Dalphon, Asphatha,
{9:8} Phoratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
{9:9} Pharmastha, Arisai, Aridai, and Uaizatha,
{9:10} The ten sonnes of Haman the sonne of Hamadata the enemie of the Iewes: but on his goodes they layed no handes.
{9:11} At the same time was the king certified of the number of those that were slaine in the citie of Susan.
{9:12} And the king saide vnto queene Esther: The Iewes haue slaine and destroyed fiue hundred men in the citie of Susan, and the ten sonnes of Haman: What haue they done thinkest thou in other landes of the king? And what is thy petition, that it may be geuen thee? or what requirest thou more to be done?
{9:13} Esther aunswered: If it please the king, let him suffer the Iewes which are in Susan, to morow also to do according vnto this dayes decree, that they may hang Hamans ten sonnes vpon the tree.
{9:14} And the king charged to do so: and the decree was deuised at Susan, and they hanged Hamans ten sonnes.
{9:15} For the Iewes that were in Susan gathered them selues together, vpon the fourteenth day of the moneth Adar, and slue three hundred men at Susan: but on their goodes they layed no handes.
{9:16} As for the other Iewes that were in the kinges prouinces, they came together and stoode for their liues, & had rest from their enemies, & slue of their enemies seuentie and fiue thousand: howbeit they layed no handes on their goodes.
{9:17} This they did on the thirteenth day of the moneth Adar, & on the fourteenth day of the same moneth rested they, which day they held with feasting and gladnesse.
{9:18} But the Iewes that were at Susan came together both on the thirteenth day and on the fourteenth: and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and held that day with feasting & gladnesse.
{9:19} And therefore the Iewes that dwelt in the villages and vnwalled townes, held the fourteenth day of the moneth Adar with gladnesse and feasting, and kept holy day, and euery one sent preasentes vnto his neighbour.
{9:20} And Mardocheus wrote these wordes, and sent letters vnto all the Iewes that were in all the prouinces of king Ahasuerus, both nie and farre:
{9:21} That they should make a lawe among the selues, & holde the fourteenth & fifteenth day of the moneth Adar, yerely.
{9:22} As the dayes wherein the Iewes came to rest from their enemies, and as a moneth wherein their paine was turned to ioy, and their sorowe into a ioyful day: and that in those dayes they should make feastes and gladnesse, and one to send giftes vnto another, and to distribute vnto the poore.
{9:23} And the Iewes promised to do as they had begunne, and as Mardocheus had written vnto them:
{9:24} Because Haman the sonne of Hamadatha the Agagite all the Iewes enemie, had deuised against the Iewes how he might destroy them, and caused to cast Phur (that is a lot) for to consume them, & to bring them to naught.
{9:25} But when Esther came before the king, he commaunded by letters that his wicked deuice which he imagined against the Iewes, should be turned vpon his owne head, and that he and his sonnes should be hanged on the tree.
{9:26} For the which cause they called these dayes Phurim, because of the name of the lot, and because of all the wordes of this writing, and what they themselues had seene, & what had come vnto them:
{9:27} And the Iewes ordayned, and toke it vpon them and their seede, and vpon all such as ioyned them selues vnto them, that they would not misse but obserue these two dayes yerely, according as they were written and appoynted in their season,
{9:28} And that these dayes are to be remembred and to be kept of childers children among al kinredes in all landes and cities: In these dayes of Phurim which are not to be ouerslipt among ye Iewes, and the memoriall of them ought not to perishe from their seede.
{9:29} And queene Esther the daughter of Abihail & Mardocheus the Iewe, wrote with all aucthoritie to confirme this second writing of Phurim.
{9:30} And he sent the letters vnto all the Iewes, to the hundred twentie and seuen prouinces of the empire of Ahasuerus, with wordes of peace and trueth:
{9:31} To confirme these dayes of Phurim in their time appoynted, according as Mardocheus the Iewe and Esther the queene had appoynted them: and they bound their soule and their seede to fasting and prayer.
{9:32} And the decree of Esther confirmed these wordes of Phurim, and was written in the booke.
{10:1} (9:33) And the king Ahasuerus layed tribute vpon the land, & vpon the iles of the sea.
{10:2} (9:34) And all the actes of his power and of his might, & the declaration of the dignitie of Mardocheus wherwith the king magnified him, be they not written in the bookes of ye chronicles of the kinges of Medes and Persia?
{10:3} (9:35) For Mardocheus the Iewe, was the second next vnto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Iewes, and accepted among the multitude of his brethren, as one that seeketh the wealth of his people, and speaketh peaceably for all his seede.
