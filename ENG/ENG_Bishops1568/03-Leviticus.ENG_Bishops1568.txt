{1:1} And the Lord called vnto Moyses, and spake vnto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying:
{1:2} Speake vnto the children of Israel, & thou shalt say vnto them: If a man of yon bring a sacrifice vnto the Lorde, ye shall bryng your sacrifice from among these cattell, euen fro among the beefes and the sheepe.
{1:3} If his sacrifice be a burnt offeryng of beefes, let hym offer a male without blemishe, and bryng hym of his owne voluntarie wyll, vnto the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lorde.
{1:4} And he shall put his hande vpon the head of the burnt sacrifice, and it shalbe accepted for hym to be his attonement.
{1:5} And he shal kill the bullocke before the Lord: And the priestes Aarons sonnes shall bryng the blood, and sprinkle it rounde about vpon the aulter that is by the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{1:6} And then shall he flay the burnt offeryng, and hewe hym in peeces.
{1:7} And the sonnes of Aaron the priest shall put fire vpon the aulter, and put wood vpon the fire.
{1:8} And the priestes Aarons sonnes shall lay the partes, euen the head and the fat, vpon the wood that is on the fyre in the aulter.
{1:9} But the inwardes and the legges thereof shall he washe in water, & the priest shall burne all in the aulter, that they may be a burnt sacrifice, an offeryng made by fire for a sweete odour vnto the Lorde.
{1:10} And if his sacrifice be of flockes, namely of the sheepe or goates, let hym bryng a male without blemishe for a burnt offeryng:
{1:11} And let hym kyll it on the north syde of the aulter, before the Lorde: And the priestes Aarons sonnes, shall sprinckle the blood round about vpon the aulter.
{1:12} And he shall cut it into his peeces, euen with his head and his fat: and the priest shall put them vpon the wood that lyeth vpon the fire in the aulter.
{1:13} But he shall washe the inwardes and the legges with water, and the priest shall bryng altogether, and burne it vpon the aulter for a burnt offeryng, an oblation made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde.
{1:14} If the burnt offeryng for the sacrifice of the Lorde be of fowles, he shall bring his sacrifice of turtle doues, or of the young pigeons.
{1:15} And the priest shall bryng it vnto the aulter, and wryng the necke a sunder of it, and burne it on the aulter: but the blood therof shalbe wroung out vpon the syde of the aulter.
{1:16} And he shall plucke away his croppe with his fethers, and cast them besyde the aulter on the east part, in the place of asshes.
{1:17} And he shall breake the wynges of it, but plucke them not asunder: And the priest shal burne it vpon the aulter, euen vpon the wood that is vpon the fire, that it may be a burnt offeryng, an oblation made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde.
{2:1} The soule that will offer a meate offeryng vnto the Lorde, his offering shalbe of fine flowre: and he shall poure oyle vpon it, and put frankensence theron:
{2:2} And shal bring it vnto Aarons sonnes the priestes: And he shall take therout his handfull of the flowre, & of the oyle with all the frakensence, and the priest shall burne it for a memoriall of hym vpon the aulter, to be an offeryng made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde.
{2:3} And the remnaunt of the meate offeryng shalbe Aarons and his sonnes, a thyng most holy of the sacrifices of the Lorde, made by fire.
{2:4} If thou bryng also a meate offeryng that is baken in the ouen, let it be an vnleauened cake of fine flowre myngled with oyle, or an vnleauened wafer annoynted with oyle.
{2:5} If thy meate offeryng be baken in the frying pan, it shalbe of vnleauened flowre myngled with oyle.
{2:6} And thou shalt part it in peeces, and powre oyle thereon: that it may be a meate offeryng.
{2:7} And yf thy meate offeryng be a thyng broyled vpon the grediron, let it be of flowre myngled with oyle.
{2:8} And thou shalt bryng the meate offeryng that is made of these thinges vnto the lord, & shalt deliuer it vnto the priest, that he may offer it vpon the aulter.
{2:9} And the priest shall take from the meate offeryng a memoriall therof, and shall burne it vpon the aulter: that it may be a burnt offeryng for a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde.
{2:10} And that which is left of the meate offeryng, shalbe Aarons & his sonnes: It is a thyng moste holye of the offerynges of the Lorde made by fire.
{2:11} All the meate offerynges which ye shal bryng vnto the Lorde, shalbe made without leauen: For ye shall neither burne leauen nor hony in any offering of the Lorde made by fire.
{2:12} In the oblation of the first fruites ye shall offer them vnto the Lorde: but they shall not be burnt vpon the aulter for a sweete sauour.
{2:13} All the meate offerynges also shalt thou season with salt, neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the couenaunt of thy God to be lackyng from thy meate offeryng: but vpon all thyne offerynges thou shalt bryng salt.
{2:14} And yf thou offer a meate offeryng of the first fruites vnto the Lorde, thou shalt offer for the meate offeryng of thy first fruites, eares of corne dryed by the fire euen beaten wheate, of full eares.
{2:15} And thou shalt put oyle vpon it, and lay frankensence theron: that it may be a meate offeryng.
{2:16} And the priest shall burne part of the beaten corne, and part of that oyle with al the franckensence, for a remebraunce: and it shalbe a sacrifice vnto the Lorde made by fire.
{3:1} And if his sacrifice be a peace offeryng, and he take it from among the droues, whether it be a male or female, he shall bryng such as is without blemishe before the Lorde.
{3:2} And put his hande vpon the head of his offeryng, and kyll it at the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation: And Aarons sonnes the priestes shal sprinkle the blood vpon the aulter round about.
{3:3} And he shall offer somewhat of the peace offeryng, to be a sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lorde: euen the fat that couereth the inwardes, and all the fat that is vpon the inwardes:
{3:4} And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, and vpon the flankes, & the kall with the lyuer shall he take away with the kidneys.
{3:5} And Aarons sonnes shall burne them on the aulter, with the burnt sacrifice which is vpon the wood that is on the fire, to be a burnt sacrifice made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord.

{3:7} And yf he offer a Lambe for his sacrifice, he shall bryng it before the Lorde,
{3:8} And put his hand vpon his offeringes head, and kyll it before the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aarons sonnes shall sprinkle the blood therof rounde about the aulter.
{3:9} And of the peace offeryng let hym bryng a sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lorde, the fat thereof, and the rumpe altogether, which they shall take of harde by the backe bone: and the fat that couereth the inwardes, and all the fat that is vpon the inwardes,
{3:10} And the two kidneys, and the fat that is vpon them, and vpon the flankes, and the kall that is vpon the liuer shall he take away with the kidneys.
{3:11} And the priest shall burne them vpon the aulter, to be the foode of a sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lorde.
{3:12} If his offeryng be a Goate, he shall bryng it before the Lorde,
{3:13} And put his hande vpon the head of it, and kyll it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sonnes of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood therof vpon the aulter rounde about.
{3:14} And he shall bring therof his offering, euen a sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord, the fat that couereth ye inwardes, & all the fat that is vpon the inwardes.
{3:15} And the two kidneys, and the fat that is vpon them, and vpon the flankes, and the kall vpon the liuer shall he take away with the kidneys.
{3:16} And the priest shall burne them vpon the aulter, for the foode of the sacrifice made by fire for a sweete sauour: All the fat is the Lordes.
{3:17} Let it be a perpetuall statute for your generations throughout your dwellynges, yt ye eate neither fat nor blood.
{4:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{4:2} Speake vnto the chyldren of Israel, and saye, If a soule shall sinne through ignoraunce in any of the commaundementes of the Lord which ought not to be done, but shall do contrarie to any of them:
{4:3} As yf the priest that is annoynted, do sinne accordyng to the sinne of the people, let hym bryng for his sinne which he hath sinned, a young bullocke without blemishe, vnto the Lorde for a sinne offeryng.
{4:4} And he shall bryng the young bullocke vnto the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord, and shall put his hand vpon the young bullockes head, and kill the young bullocke before the Lorde.
{4:5} And the priest that is annoynted shall take of the young bullockes blood, and bryng it into the tabernacle of the congregation.
{4:6} And the priest shall dippe his finger in the blood, and sprinckle therof seuen tymes before the Lorde, euen before the vayle of the sanctuarie.
{4:7} And the priest shall put some of the blood before the Lord, vpon the hornes of the aulter of sweete insence, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation, & shall powre all the blood of the young bullocke vnto the bottome of the aulter of burnt offeryng, which is at the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{4:8} And he shall take away all the fat of the bullocke for the sinne offeryng, the fat that couereth the inwardes, and all the fat that is about the inwardes,
{4:9} And the two kidneyes, and the fat that is vpon them, & vpon the flanckes, and the kall vpon the liuer shall he take away with the kidneys,
{4:10} As it was taken away in the bullocke of the peace offeringes: and let the priest burne them vpon the aulter of burnt offeryng.
{4:11} But the skinne of the young bullocke, and all his fleshe, with his head and his legges, with his inwardes & his doung, shall he beare out
{4:12} And cary the whole bullocke altogether out of the hoast vnto a cleane place, euen where the asshes are powred out, & burne hym there on wood in the fire: euen by the place where the asshes are cast out, shall he be burnt.
{4:13} If the whole congregation of Israel sinne through ignoraunce, & the thing be hyd from the eyes of the multitude, and haue done somewhat agaynst any of the comaundementes of ye Lorde which shoulde not be done, and haue offended:
{4:14} Whe the sinne which they haue sinned is knowen, the congregatio shal bring a young bullocke for the sinne, & bring him before ye tabernacle of the congregation,
{4:15} And the elders of the multitude shall put their handes vpon the head of the bullocke before the Lorde: And the bullocke shalbe slayne before the Lord.
{4:16} And the priest that is annoynted, shall bryng of the bullockes blood into the tabernacle of the congregation.

{4:18} And shall put of the blood vpon the hornes of the aulter, which is before the Lorde in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall powre all the blood vnto the bottome of the aulter of burnt offeryng, which is before the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{4:19} And he shall take his fat from hym, and burne it vpon the aulter,
{4:20} And shall do with this bullocke as he dyd with the bullocke for sinne, euen so shall he do with this: And the priest shal make an attonement for them, and it shalbe forgeuen them.
{4:21} And he shall bryng this bullocke without the hoast, & burne him as he burned the first bullocke: For it is an oblation for the sinne of the congregation.
{4:22} When a Lorde sinneth, and comitteth through ignorauce any of these thynges which the Lorde his God hath forbidden to be done in his commaundementes, and hath offended:
{4:23} And if his sinne be shewed vnto hym which he hath done, he shall bryng his offeryng, euen an hee goate without blemishe,
{4:24} And lay his hande vpon ye head of the hee goate, and kyll it in the place where the burnt offeryng is vsed to be kylled before ye Lorde: For it is a sinne offering.
{4:25} And let the priest take of ye blood of the sinne offeryng with his finger, & put it vpon the hornes of the burnt offeryng aulter, and powre his blood vnto the bottome of the burnt offeryng aulter,
{4:26} And burne all his fat vpon ye aulter, as ye fat of the peace offeringes: And ye priest shal make an attonement for him as cocerning his sinne, & it shalbe forgeue him.
{4:27} If one of the common people of the lande sinne through ignoraunce, & commit any of the thynges which the Lord hath forbidden in his comaundementes to be done, and so hath trespassed:
{4:28} If his sinne which he hath sinned come to his knowledge, he shall bryng for his offeryng a shee goate from among the flockes without blemishe for his sinne which he hath sinned,
{4:29} And lay his hande vpon the head of the sinne offeryng, and slay the sinne offering in the place of burnt offerynges.
{4:30} And the priest shall take of the blood therof with his finger, and put it vpon the hornes of the burnt offeryng aulter, & powre all the blood vnto the bottome of the aulter,
{4:31} And shall take away all his fat, as the fat of the peace offeryng is taken away: And the priest shal burne it vpon the aulter, that it may be a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde, and the priest shal make an attonement for hym, and it shalbe forgeuen hym.
{4:32} And yf he bryng a sheepe for a sinne offeryng, he shall bryng a female without blemishe,
{4:33} And lay his hande vpon the head of the sinne offeryng, and slea it for a sinne offering in the place where they kill the burnt offeryng.
{4:34} And the priest shal take of the blood of the sinne offeryng with his finger, & put it vpon the hornes of the burnt offering aulter, and shall powre the blood thereof vnto the bottome of the aulter.
{4:35} And he shall take away all the fat therof, as the fat of ye sheepe of the peace offering is wont to be taken away: And the priest shall burne it vpon the aulter, that it may be the Lordes burnt sacrifice, and the priest shall make an attonement for his sinne that he hath committed, and it shalbe forgeuen hym.
{5:1} If a soule sinne, and heare the voyce of swearing, and is a witnesse, whether he hath seene or knowen of it, if he do not vtter it, he shall beare his sinne.
{5:2} Either if a soule touche any vncleane thyng, whether it be the carion of an vncleane beast, or a carion of vncleane cattell, or a carion of vncleane creeping thynges, and is not ware of it: beholde, he is vncleane, and hath offended.
{5:3} Either if he touche any vncleannesse of man, whatsoeuer vncleannesse it be that a man is wont to be defiled withall, and is not ware of it, and commeth to ye knowledge of it, he hath trespassed.
{5:4} Either if a soule sweare, and pronounceth with his lippes to do euill or to do good, whatsoeuer it be that a man shall pronounce with an othe, and the thyng be hyd from hym, and commeth to the knowledge of it, and hath offended in one of these:
{5:5} When he hath sinned in one of these thinges, he shall confesse that he hath sinned in that thyng.
{5:6} Therfore shall he bryng his trespasse offering vnto the Lorde, for his sinne whiche he hath sinned, a female from the flocke, a lambe or a shee goate, for a sinne offering: And the priest shal make an attonement for hym concerning his sinne.
{5:7} And if he be not able to bryng a sheepe, he shall bryng for his trespasse whiche he hath sinned, two turtle doues, or two young pigeons vnto the Lorde: one for a sinne offering, & the other for a burnt offering.
{5:8} And he shall bryng them vnto ye priest, which shall offer the sinne offering first, and wryng the necke a sunder of it, but plucke it not cleane of.
{5:9} And he shall sprinckle of the blood of the sinne offering vpon the side of the aulter, and the rest of the blood shall he powre by the bottome of the aulter: for it is a sinne offering.
{5:10} And he shall offer the seconde for a burnt offering, as the maner is: and so shall the priest make an attonement for hym for the sinne whiche he hath sinned, and it shalbe forgeuen hym.
{5:11} And if he be not able to bryng two turtle doues, or two young pigeons, then he that hath sinned shall bryng for his offering the tenth part of an Epha of fine floure for a sinne offering: but put none oyle thereto, neither put any frankensence theron: for it is a sinne offering.
{5:12} Then shall he bryng it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handfull of it for a remembraunce thereof, & burne it vpon the aulter, to be a sacrifice for the Lord made by fire: for it is a sinne offering.
{5:13} And the priest shall make an attonement for hym as touchyng his sinne that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shalbe forgeuen hym: And the remnaunt shalbe the priestes, as a meate offering.
{5:14} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{5:15} If a soule trespasse and sinne thorowe ignoraunce in thinges that are consecrated vnto the Lorde, let hym bryng for his trespasse vnto the Lord, a Ramme without blemishe out of the flockes, valued in money at two sicles, after the sicle of the sanctuarie, that it may be for a trespasse offering.
{5:16} And he shall make amendes for the harme that he hath done in the holy thyng, & let hym put the fift part more thereto, and geue it vnto the priest: And the priest shall make an attonement for hym, with the Ramme that is for the trespasse, and it shalbe forgeuen hym.
{5:17} If a soule sinne, and commit any of these thinges whiche are forbydden to be done by the comaundementes of the Lorde, and wyst it not, & hath offended, and beare his sinne:
{5:18} Then shall he bryng a Ramme without blemishe out of the flocke, that is esteemed to be worth a trespasse offering, vnto the priest: And the priest shall make an attonement for hym concerning his ignoraunce, wherein he erred, and was not ware, and it shalbe forgeuen hym.
{5:19} This is a trespasse offering, for the trespasse committed against the Lorde.
{6:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying.
{6:2} If a soule sinne and trespasse agaynst the Lorde, and denie vnto his neyghbour that which was taken him to kepe, or that was put into his hands, or doth violent robberie or wrong vnto his neyghbour,
{6:3} Or if he haue founde that which was lost, and denieth it, and sweareth falsely vpon whatsoeuer thing it be that a man doth, and sinneth therein:
{6:4} If he haue so sinned and trespassed, he shall restore agayne that he toke violently away, or the wrong which he did, or that whiche was deliuered hym to kepe, or the lost thyng which he founde:
{6:5} And all that about whiche he hath sworne falsely, he shall restore it agayne in the whole summe, and shall adde the fifth part more thereto, and geue it vnto him to whom it appertayneth, the same day that he offereth for his trespasse.
{6:6} And let him bryng for his trespasse vnto the Lorde a Ramme without blemishe out of the flocke, that is esteemed worth a trespasse offering vnto ye priest.
{6:7} And the priest shall make an attonement for hym before the Lorde, and it shalbe forgeuen hym whatsoeuer thing it be that he hath done and trespassed therein.
{6:8} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{6:9} Commaunde Aaron and his sonnes, saying: (This is the lawe of the burnt offering. The burnt offering shalbe vpon the harth of the aulter all nyght, vnto the mornyng, and the fire shall be kyndled on the aulter.)
{6:10} And the priest shall put on his linnen garment, and his linnen breeches vpon his fleshe, and take away the asshes vpon the whiche the fire consumed the burnt sacrifice in the aulter, and he shall put them beside the aulter,
{6:11} And put of his rayment, and put on other, and carry the asshes out without the hoast vnto a cleane place.
{6:12} The fire vpon the aulter shall burne styll, & neuer be put out: But the priest shall laye wood on it euery day in the morning, and put the burnt sacrifice vppon it, and he shall burne theron the fat of the peace offeringes.
{6:13} The fire shall euer burne vpon the aulter, and neuer go out.
{6:14} This is the lawe of the meate offering, which Aarons sonnes shall bryng before the Lord, euen before the aulter:
{6:15} And one of them shall take his handfull of the floure of the meate offering, and of the oyle, and al the franckensence whiche is vpon the meate offering, and shall burne it vnto a remembraunce vppon the aulter for a sweete sauour, euen a memoriall of it vnto the Lorde.
{6:16} And of the rest therof, shall Aaron and his sonnes eate: vnleauened shall it be eaten in the holy place, euen in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eate it.
{6:17} It shall not be baken with leauen: I haue geuen it vnto them for their portion of my sacrifices made by fire: It is most holy, as is the sinne offering, and the trespasse offering.
{6:18} All the males among the chyldren of Aaron shall eate of it: It shalbe a statute for euer in your generations concerning the sacrifice of the Lorde made by fire: let euery one that toucheth it, be holy.
{6:19} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{6:20} This is the offering of Aaron, and of his sonnes, whiche they shall offer vnto the Lord in the day when he is annoynted: The tenth part of an Epha of floure for a meate offering perpetuall, halfe of it in the morning, and halfe therof at nyght.
{6:21} In the frying panne it shalbe made with oyle, and when it is fryed, thou shalt bryng it in: and the baken peeces of the meate offeringes shalt thou offer for a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde.
{6:22} And the priest of his sonnes, that is annoynted in his steede, shall offer it: It is the Lordes ordinaunce for euer, it shalbe burnt altogether.
{6:23} For euery meate offering that is made for the priest, shalbe burnt altogether, and shall not be eaten.
{6:24} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{6:25} Speake vnto Aaron, and vnto his sonnes, and say, This is the lawe of the sinne offering: In the place where the burnt offering is kylled, shall the sinne offering be kylled before the Lorde, for it is most holy.
{6:26} The priest that offereth it, shall eate it: In the holy place shall it be eaten, euen in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{6:27} Whatsoeuer shall touche the fleshe thereof, shalbe holy: and when there droppeth of the blood therof vpon any garment, thou shalt washe that wheron it droppeth, in the holy place.
{6:28} But the earthen pot that it is sodden in, shalbe broken: And yf it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shalbe scoured, & rensed in the water.
{6:29} All the males among the priestes shal eate therof, for it is most holy.
{6:30} And no sinne offeryng whose blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withall in the holy place, shalbe eaten: but shalbe burnt in the fire.
{7:1} Likewyse this is the lawe of the trespasse offering: it is moste holy.
{7:2} In the place where they kyll the burnt offering, shall they kyll the trespasse offering also, & the blood thereof shall he sprinckle rounde about vpon the aulter.
{7:3} All the fat thereof shall he offer, the rumpe, and the fat that couereth the inwardes,
{7:4} And the two kydneys, and the fat that is on them, and vpon the flankes, and the kall that is on the liuer shalt thou take away with the kydneys.
{7:5} And the priest shall burne them vpon the aulter, to be a sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lorde: for it is a trespasse offering.
{7:6} All the males among the priestes shall eate thereof: it shalbe eaten in the holy place, for it is most holy.
{7:7} As the sinne offering is, so is the trespasse offering, one law serueth for both: that wherwith the priest shall make attonement, shalbe his.
{7:8} And the priest that offereth any mans burnt offering, shall haue the skynne of ye burnt offering whiche he hath offred.
{7:9} And all the meate offering that is baken in the ouen, and that is dressed in the panne, and in the frying panne, shalbe the priestes that offereth it.
{7:10} And euery meate offering that is mingled with oyle, and that is drye, shall pertayne vnto all the sonnes of Aaron, and one shall haue as muche as another.
{7:11} This is the law of the peace offering, whiche he shall offer vnto the Lorde.
{7:12} If he offer it to geue thankes, he shall bryng vnto his thanke offering vnleauened cakes mingled with oyle, and vnleauened wafers annoynted with oyle, and cakes mingled with oyle of fine floure fryed.
{7:13} He shall bryng his offering, with cakes of vnleauend bread for his peace offeringes, to geue thankes:
{7:14} And of all the sacrifice he shall offer one for an heaue offering vnto the Lorde, and it shalbe the priestes that sprinckled the blood of the peace offeringes.
{7:15} And the fleshe of his peace offeringes for thankes geuing, shalbe eate the same day that it is offred: And let hym leaue nothyng of it vntill the morowe.
{7:16} But if the offering of his sacrifice be a vowe, or of his owne free wyll, it shalbe eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and if ought remayne vntill the morowe, it may be eaten.
{7:17} But as muche of the offered fleshe as remayneth vnto the thirde day, shalbe burnt with fire.
{7:18} And if any of the flesh of his peace offeringes be eaten in the thirde day, then shall he that offereth it obtayne no fauour, neither shall it be reckened vnto him, but shalbe an abhomination: therfore the soule that eateth of it, shal beare his sinne.
{7:19} And the fleshe that toucheth any vncleane thing, shal not be eaten, but burnt with fire: and of this fleshe all that be cleane, shall eate therof.
{7:20} But if any soule eate of the fleshe of the peace offering that pertayneth vnto the Lord, hauing his vnclennesse vpon him: the same soule shall be cut of from among his people.
{7:21} Moreouer, the soule that doth touche any vncleane thyng, that is of the vncleannesse of man, or of any vncleane beast, or any abhomination that is vncleane, and then eate of the fleshe of the peace offering whiche pertayneth vnto the Lorde: that soule shal be cut of from his people.
{7:22} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{7:23} Speake vnto the chyldren of Israel, and say: Ye shall eate no maner fat of beeues, of sheepe, and of goates.
{7:24} Neuerthelater, the fat of the beast that dyeth alone, and the fat of that which is torne with wilde beastes, shalbe occupied in any maner of vse: but ye shall in no wyse eate of it.
{7:25} For whosoeuer eateth the fat of the beast, of which men vse to bryng an offering made by fire vnto the Lorde: that soule that eateth it, shall be cut of from his people.
{7:26} Moreouer, ye shall eate no maner of blood, whether it be of foule or of beast, in any your dwellynges.
{7:27} Whatsoeuer soule it be that eateth any maner of blood, the same soule shall be cut of from his people.
{7:28} And the Lorde talked with Moyses, saying:
{7:29} Speake vnto the chyldren of Israel, and say: He that bringeth his peace offeryng vnto the Lorde, let hym bryng his gift vnto the Lord of his peace offering:
{7:30} Let his owne handes bryng the offeringes of the Lorde made by fire: euen the fat with the brest shal he bryng, that the brest may be waued for a waue offering before the Lorde.
{7:31} And the priest shall burne the fat vpon the aulter, and the brest shalbe Aarons and his sonnes.
{7:32} And the ryght shoulder shall ye geue vnto the priest for an heaue offeryng of your peace offerynges.
{7:33} The same that offereth the blood of the peace offeringes and the fat among the sonnes of Aaron, shall haue the right shoulder for his part:
{7:34} For the waue brest and the heaue shoulder haue I taken of the chyldren of Israel, eue of their peace offeringes, and haue geuen them vnto Aaron the priest, & vnto his sonnes, by a statute for euer fro among the chyldren of Israel.
{7:35} This is the annoynting of Aaron, and the annoynting of his sonnes cocerning the sacrifices of the Lorde made by fire, in the day when he offred them to be priestes vnto the Lorde.
{7:36} And these be the portions whiche the Lorde commaunded to be geuen them in the day of their annoynting from among the chyldren of Israel, by a statute for euer in their generations.
{7:37} This is the law of the burnt offering, and of the meate offering, and of the sacrifice for sinne and trespasse, for consecrations, and for the peace offering:
{7:38} Whiche the Lord commaunded Moyses in the mount of Sinai, whe he commaunded the children of Israel to offer their sacrifices vnto the Lorde in the wyldernesse of Sinai.
{8:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{8:2} Take Aaron and his sonnes with hym, and the vestures, and the annoynting oyle, and a bullocke for a sinne offering, and two Rammes, and a basket of vnleauened bread:
{8:3} And gather thou all the congregation together vnto the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{8:4} And Moyses dyd as the Lorde commaunded him: and the people were gathered together vnto the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{8:5} And Moyses sayd vnto the congregation: This is the thing which the Lord commaunded to be done.
{8:6} And Moyses brought Aaron and his sonnes, and washed them with water:
{8:7} And put vpon him the coate, and gyrded hym with a gyrdle, and put vpon hym the robe, and put the Ephod theron, whiche he gyrded with the brodered garde that was in the Ephod, and bounde it vnto him therewith.
{8:8} And he put the brestplate theron, and put in the brestplate the Urim and the Thummim.
{8:9} And he put the cap of estate vpon his head, and put vpon the cap, euen vpon the forefront, the golden plate, the holy crowne, as the Lorde commaunded Moyses.
{8:10} And Moyses toke the annoyntyng oyle, and annoynted the tabernacle and al that was therin, and sanctified them.
{8:11} And sprinckled therof vpon the aulter seuen tymes, and annoynted the aulter and all his vesselles, the lauer and his foote, to sanctifie them.
{8:12} And he powred of the annoynting oyle vpon Aarons head, & annoynted hym, to sanctifie hym.
{8:13} And Moyses brought Aarons sonnes, and put coates vpon them, and gyrded them with gyrdles, and put bonettes vpon their heades, as the Lorde commaunded Moyses.
{8:14} And he brought the Bullocke for the sinne offering: and Aaron & his sonnes put their handes vpon the head of the Bullocke for the sinne offering.
{8:15} And Moyses slewe hym, and toke the blood, which he put vpon the hornes of the aulter rounde about with his finger, and purified the aulter, and powred the blood at the bottome of the aulter, & sanctified it, to make reconciliatio vpo it.
{8:16} And he toke all the fat that was vpon the inwardes, and the kall of the liuer, and the two kydneys and their fat, and Moyses burned it vpon the aulter.
{8:17} But the Bullocke, & his hide, his flesh, and his dounge, he burnt with fyre without the hoast, as the Lorde commaunded Moyses.
{8:18} And he brought the Ramme for the burnt offering, and Aaron & his sonnes put their handes vpon the head of the Ramme,
{8:19} Whiche Moyses killed, and sprinckled the blood vpo the aulter rounde about.
{8:20} And Moyses cut the Ramme into his peeces, and burnt the head, the peeces, and the fat.
{8:21} And washed ye inwardes & the legges in water, & Moyses burnt the Ramme euerywhyt vpon the aulter: for it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweete sauour, and an offering made by fire vnto the Lord, as the Lorde commaunded Moyses.
{8:22} And he brought the other Ramme, namely the Ramme of consecrations: and Aaron and his sonnes put their handes vpon the head of the Ramme,
{8:23} Which Moyses slewe, and toke of the blood of it, and put it vpon the tip of Aarons right eare, and vpon the thumbe of his ryght hande, and vpon the great toe of his ryght foote.
{8:24} And Moyses brought Aarons sonnes, and put of the blood on the tippe of the right eare of them, & vpon the thumbes of theyr right handes, & vpon the great toes of their ryght feete: and Moyses sprinckled the blood vpon the aulter rounde about.
{8:25} And he toke the fat, and the rumpe, and all the fat that was vpon the inwardes, and the kall of the liuer, and the two kydneys with their fat, and the ryght shoulder.
{8:26} And out of the basket of vnleauened bread that was before the Lorde, he toke one vnleauened cake, and a cake of oyled bread, and one wafer, & put them on the fat, and vpon the right shoulder:
{8:27} And put altogether vpon Aarons handes, & vpon his sonnes handes, and waued it a waue offering before the Lord.
{8:28} And Moyses toke them from of their handes, and burnt them vpon the aulter for a burnt offering: These were consecrations for a sweete sauour and sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lorde.
{8:29} And Moyses toke the brest, and waued it for a waue offering before the Lorde: for of the Ramme of consecrations, it was Moyses part, as the Lorde commaunded Moyses.
{8:30} And Moyses toke of the annoynting oyle, and of the blood which was vpon the aulter, & sprinckled it vpon Aaron and vpon his garmentes, and vpon his sonnes and on his sonnes garmentes with him: and sanctified Aaron and his vestures, and his sonnes and his sonnes vestures with hym.
{8:31} And Moyses sayde vnto Aaron and his sonnes: Boyle the fleshe at the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation, and there eate it with the bread that is in the basket of consecration, and as I commaunded, saying, Aaron and his sonnes shall eate it.
{8:32} And that whiche remayneth of the fleshe and of the bread, shall ye burne with fyre.
{8:33} And ye shall not depart from the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation seuen dayes, vntyll the dayes of your consecrations be at an ende: for seuen dayes shall he fill your hande.
{8:34} As he did this day: euen so the Lorde hath commaunded to do, to make an attonement for you.
{8:35} Therefore shall ye abyde at the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation day and nyght seuen dayes long, and kepe the watch of the Lord, and ye shal not dye: for so I am commaunded.
{8:36} And so Aaron and his sonnes, dyd all thinges whiche the Lorde commaunded by the hande of Moyses.
{9:1} And in the eyght day, Moyses called Aaron and his sonnes, and the elders of Israel.
{9:2} And he sayd vnto Aaro: Take thee a young Calfe for a sin offering, and a Ramme for a burnt offering, both without blemishe, and bryng them before the Lorde.
{9:3} And vnto the chyldren of Israel thou shalt speake, saying: Take ye an hee Goate for a sinne offering, and a Calfe & a Lambe both of a yere olde, without blemishe, for a burnt sacrifice.
{9:4} Also a Bullocke & a Ramme for peace offeringes, to offer before the Lord, and a meate offering mingled with oyle: for to day the Lord will appeare vnto you.
{9:5} And they brought that whiche Moyses commaunded, before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation came and stode before the Lord.
{9:6} And Moyses sayd: This is the thyng whiche the Lord commaunded that ye should do, & the glory of the Lorde shall appeare vnto you.
{9:7} And Moyses sayde vnto Aaron: Go vnto the aulter, and offer the sacrifice for thy sinne, & thy burnt offering, and make an attonement for thee and for the people: & thou shalt offer the offering of the people, and make an attonement for them, as ye Lord comaunded.
{9:8} Aaron therfore went vnto the aulter, and slewe the Calfe of the sinne offering, whiche was for him selfe.
{9:9} And the sonnes of Aaron brought the blood vnto him, and he dypt his finger in the blood, and put it vpon the hornes of the aulter, and powred the blood at the bottome of the aulter.
{9:10} But the fat and the two kydneys, and the kall of the liuer of the sinne offering he burnt vpon the aulter, as the Lorde commaunded Moyses.
{9:11} The flesh and the hyde he burnt with fyre without the hoast.
{9:12} And he slewe the burnt offering, and Aarons sonnes brought vnto hym the blood, whiche he sprinckled rounde about vpon the aulter.
{9:13} And they brought the burnt offering vnto hym with the peeces therof, & the head: and he burnt them vpo the aulter.
{9:14} And he dyd washe the inwardes and the legges, and burnt them vpon the burnt offeryng in the aulter.
{9:15} And then he brought the peoples offering, taking the Goate whiche was the sinne offering for the people, & slewe it, & offered it for sinne, as he dyd the first.
{9:16} And brought the burnt offering, and offered it as the maner was.
{9:17} And he brought the meate offering, and filled his hande therof, and burnt it vpon the aulter, beside the burnt sacrifice of the mornyng.
{9:18} He slewe also the Bullocke and the Ramme for the peace offering, whiche was for the people: and Aarons sonnes brought vnto hym the blood, which he sprinckled vpon the aulter round about:
{9:19} And the fat of the Bullocke, and of the Ramme, the rumpe, and that couereth the inwardes, and the kidneyes, and the kall of the liuer.
{9:20} And they put the fat vpon the breastes, and he burnt the fat vpon the aulter:
{9:21} But the breastes and the ryght shoulder, Aaron waued for a waue offering before the Lorde, as the Lorde commaunded Moyses.
{9:22} And Aaron lift vp his hande ouer the people, and blessed them, & came downe fro offering of the sinne offering, burnt offering, and peace offeringes.
{9:23} And Moyses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, & came out, and blessed the people: and the glorie of the Lorde appeared vnto all the people.
{9:24} And there came a fire out from before the Lorde, and consumed vpon the aulter the burnt offering & the fat: Whiche when all the people sawe, they gaue thankes, and fell on their faces.
{10:1} And Nadab and Abihu, the sonnes of Aaron, toke eyther of the his censar, and put fire therein, and put cense therevpon, and offred straunge fire before the Lorde, whiche he commaunded them not.
{10:2} And there went a fire from the Lord, and consumed them, and they dyed before the Lorde.
{10:3} Then Moyses sayde vnto Aaron: This is it that the Lorde spake, saying: I wyll be sanctified in them that come nye me, and before all the people I wylbe glorified. And Aaron helde his peace.
{10:4} And Moyses called Misael and Elsaphan the sonnes of Oziel, the vncle of Aaron, & sayd vnto them: Come neare, cary your brethren from before the sanctuarie, out of the hoast.
{10:5} And they went to them, & caryed them in their coates out of the hoast, as Moyses had sayde.
{10:6} And Moyses sayde vnto Aaron, and vnto Eleazar & Ithamar his sonnes: Uncouer not your heades, neither rent your clothes, lest ye dye, and lest wrath come vpon all the people: But let your brethren the whole house of Israel, bewayle the burnyng whiche the Lorde hath kyndled.
{10:7} And go not ye out from the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye dye: for the annonynting oyle of God is vpon you. And they dyd as Moyses sayde.
{10:8} And the Lorde spake vnto Aaron, saying:
{10:9} Thou shalt not drinke wine nor strong drinke, thou nor thy sonnes that are with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye dye: Let it be a lawe for euer throughout your generations.
{10:10} And that ye may put difference betweene holy and vnholy, betweene vncleane and cleane:
{10:11} And that ye may teache the chyldren of Israel all the statutes whiche the Lorde hath spoken vnto them by the handes of Moyses.
{10:12} And Moyses sayde vnto Aaron, and vnto Eleazar, and Ithamar his sonnes that were left: Take the meate offering that remayneth of the sacrifices of the Lord made by fire, and eate it without leauen beside the aulter: for it is most holy.
{10:13} Ye shall eate it in the holy place, because it is thy duetie, & thy sonnes duetie, of the sacrifices of the Lord made by fire: for so I am commaunded.
{10:14} And the waue brest and heaue shoulder shall ye eate in a cleane place, thou and thy sonnes and thy daughters with thee: For they be thy duetie, and thy sonnes duetie, geuen out of the peace offeringes of the children of Israel.
{10:15} The heaue shoulder & the waue brest shall they bryng in with the sacrifices made by fire of the fat, to waue it for a waue offering before the Lorde: and it shalbe thyne and thy sonnes with thee by a lawe for euer, as the Lorde hath commaunded.
{10:16} And Moyses sought the goate that was offred for sinne, & see, it was burnt. And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar the sonnes of Aaron whiche were left aliue, saying:
{10:17} Wherefore haue ye not eaten the sinne offering in the holy place? seing it is most holy, & God hath geuen it yon, to beare the sinne of the congregation, to make agreement for them before the Lorde.
{10:18} Beholde, ye blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: Ye shoulde haue eaten it in the holy place, as I commaunded.
{10:19} And Aaron sayde vnto Moyses: Beholde, this day haue they offered their sinne offering, and their burnt offering before the Lorde: and suche thinges are come vnto me, if I had eaten the sinne offering to day, shoulde it haue ben accepted in the sight of the Lorde?
{10:20} And when Moyses hearde that, he was content.
{11:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses and Aaron, and sayde vnto them:
{11:2} Speake vnto the chyldren of Israel, and say: These are the beastes whiche ye shall eate, among all the beastes that are on the earth.
{11:3} Whatsoeuer parteth the hoofe, and is clouen footed, and chaweth cud among the beastes, that shall ye eate.
{11:4} Neuerthelesse, these shall ye not eate, of them that chawe cud, and deuideth the hoofe: onlye as is the Camell, whiche chaweth cud, but he deuideth not the hoofe, therefore is he vncleane vnto you.
{11:5} Euen so the Connie whiche chaweth the cud, but deuideth not the hoofe, he is vncleane to you.
{11:6} And the Hare, though he chaweth the cud, yet because he deuideth not ye hoofe, he is therefore vncleane to you.
{11:7} And agayne the Swyne, though he deuide the hoofe, and is clouen footed, yet he chaweth not the cud, he is vncleane to you.
{11:8} Of their fleshe shall ye not eate, and their carkasses shall ye not touche: but let them be vncleane to you.
{11:9} These shall ye eate, of all that are in the waters: whatsoeuer hath finnes and skales in the waters, seas, and riuers, that shall ye eate.
{11:10} And all that haue not finnes nor skales in the sea and riuers, of all that moue and liue in the waters, let them be abhomination vnto you.
{11:11} They I say, shalbe an abhomination vnto you: ye shall not eate of their flesh, but abhorre their carkasses.
{11:12} Let all that haue no finnes nor skales in the waters, be abhominable vnto you.
{11:13} These are they whiche ye shall abhorre among the foules, and that ought not to be eaten, for they are an abhomination: The Egle, the Goshauke, and the Ospray,
{11:14} The Uultur, and the Kyte after his kinde,
{11:15} And all Rauens after their kinde,
{11:16} The Estrich, the nyght Crowe, the Coockowe, and the Hauke after his kynde,
{11:17} The Falcon, the Cormorant, the great Owle,
{11:18} The Backe, the Pellicane, the Pye,
{11:19} The Storke, the Iay after his kinde, the Lapwyng, and the Swalowe.
{11:20} Let all foules that creepe and go vpon all foure, be an abhomination vnto you.
{11:21} Yet these may ye eate, of euery creepyng thyng that hath wynges, and go vpon foure feete: euen those that haue not bowynges aboue vpon their feete, to leape withall vpon the earth.
{11:22} Euen these of them ye may eate: the Arbe after his kinde, the Selaam after his kinde, the Hargol after his kinde, and the Hagab after his kinde.
{11:23} All other foules that creepe and haue foure feete, shalbe abhomination vnto you.
{11:24} In such ye be vncleane: and whosoeuer toucheth the carkasse of them, shalbe vncleane vntyll the euen:
{11:25} And whosoeuer beareth the carkasse of them, shall washe his clothes, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{11:26} And euery beast that hath hoofe, and is not clouen footed, nor chaweth cud, such are vncleane vnto you: euery one that toucheth them, shalbe vncleane.
{11:27} And whatsoeuer goeth vppon his pawes, among all maner beastes that go on all foure feete such are vncleane vnto you: and who so doth touche their carkasse shalbe vncleane vntyll the euen.
{11:28} And he that beareth the carkasse of them, shall washe his clothes, and be vncleane vntyll the euen: for such are vncleane vnto you.
{11:29} And let these also be vncleane to you, among the thynges that creepe vpon the earth: the Weasel, and the Mouse, and the Toade after ther kinde:
{11:30} The Hedhogge, the Stellio, the Lacert, the Snayle, and the Moole.
{11:31} These are vncleane to you among all that creepe: whosoeuer doth touche them when they be dead, shalbe vncleane vntyll the euen.
{11:32} And whatsoeuer any of the dead carkasses of them doth fall vpon, shalbe vncleane, whether it be vessell of wood, or rayment, or skinne, or sacke, or whatsoeuer vessell it be that any worke is wrought in: and it must be plunged in the water, and it shalbe vncleane vntyll the euen, and so shall it be cleansed.
{11:33} All maner of earthen vessell wherinto any of them falleth, shalbe vncleane, with all that therein is, and it shalbe broken.
{11:34} All maner meate also that is vsed to be eaten, yf any such water come vpo it, shalbe vncleane: And all maner drynke that is vsed to be drunke in all maner such vessels, shalbe vncleane.
{11:35} And euery thyng that their carkasse falleth vpon, shalbe vncleane, whether it be ouen or kettle, let it be broken: For they are vncleane, and shalbe vncleane vnto you.
{11:36} Neuerthelater, yet the fountaynes, and welles, and collection of waters, shalbe cleane styll: but that which toucheth their carkasses, shalbe vncleane.
{11:37} If the dead carkasse of any such fall vpon any seede vsed to sowe, it shall yet be cleane styll:
{11:38} But and yf any water be powred vpon the seede, and a dead carkasse fall theron, it shalbe vncleane vnto you.
{11:39} If any beast of which ye may eate, dye, and any man touche the dead carkasse thereof, he shalbe vncleane vntyll the euen.
{11:40} He that eateth of the dead carkasse of it, shall washe his clothes, and be vncleane vntyll the euen: And he also that beareth the carkasse of it, shall washe his clothes, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{11:41} Let euery creepyng thyng that creepeth vpon the earth be an abhomination, and not be eaten.
{11:42} Whatsoeuer goeth vpon the brest, and whatsoeuer goeth vpon foure, or that hath mo feete among all creepyng thynges that creepe vpon the earth: of that see ye eate not, for they are abhominable.
{11:43} Ye shall not make your soules abhominable with nothyng that creepeth, neither make your selues vncleane with them, that ye shoulde be defyled therby.
{11:44} For I am the Lorde your God: Be sanctified therfore, and ye shalbe holy, for I am holy: and ye shall not defyle your soules with any maner of creeping thyng that creepeth vpon the earth:
{11:45} For I am the Lorde that brought you out of the lande of Egypt, to be your God: ye shalbe holy therfore, for I am holy.
{11:46} This is the lawe of beastes & foules, and of euery lyuyng creature that moueth in the waters, and of euery creature that creepeth vpon the earth,
{11:47} That there may be a difference betweene the vncleane and cleane, and betweene the beast that may be eaten, and the beast that ought not to be eaten.
{12:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{12:2} Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say: yf a woman hath conceaued seede, and borne a man chylde, she shalbe vncleane seuen dayes: euen according to the dayes of the seperation of her infirmitie shall she be vncleane.
{12:3} And in the eyght day, the fleshe of the childes foreskinne shalbe cut away.
{12:4} And she shall then continue in ye blood of her purifiyng three and thirtie dayes: She shall touche no halowed thyng, nor come into the sanctuarie, vntyll the tyme of her purifiyng be out.
{12:5} If she beare a mayde chylde, she shalbe vncleane two weekes, accordyng as in her seperation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifiyng three score and sixe dayes.
{12:6} And when the dayes of her purifiyng are out, whether it be for a sonne or for a daughter, she shall bryng a lambe of one yere olde for a burnt offeryng, and a young pigeon or a turtle doue for a sinne offeryng, vnto the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation, vnto the priest:
{12:7} Which shall offer them before the Lord, and make an attonement for her, and she shalbe purged of the issue of her blood. And this is the lawe for her that hath borne a male or female.
{12:8} But and yf she be not able to bryng a lambe, she shall bryng two turtles or two young pigeons, the one for ye burnt offering, & the other for a sinne offering: And the priest shall make an attonemet for her, and she shalbe cleane.
{13:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses & Aaron saying:
{13:2} The man that shall haue in the skinne of his fleshe, a swellyng, either a scabbe, or a glistryng whyte, and the plague of leprosie be in the skinne of his fleshe, he shalbe brought vnto Aaron the priest, or vnto one of his sonnes the priestes.
{13:3} And the priest shall loke on the sore in the skinne of his fleshe: and when the heere in the sore is turned to whyte, and the sore also seeme to be lower then the skinne of his fleshe, it is a plague of leprosie: and the priestes shall loke on hym, and iudge hym vncleane.
{13:4} If there be a whyte plecke in ye skinne of his fleshe, and seeme not to be lower then the skinne, nor the heere thereof is turned vnto whyte, the priest shall shut vp hym that hath the plague seue dayes.
{13:5} And ye priest shall loke vpon him againe the seuenth day: and if the plague seeme to him to abide styll, & the plague growe not in the skinne, the priest shall shut vp hym that hath ye plague, seuen dayes mo.
{13:6} And the priest shal loke on him agayne the seuenth day: Then yf the plague be darker, and not growen in the skynne, the priest shall iudge hym cleane, for it is but a scabbe: And he shall washe his clothes and be cleane.
{13:7} But yf the scabbe growe in the skynne after that he is seene of the priest and iudged cleane, he shalbe seene of the priest agayne.
{13:8} If the priest see that the scabbe be growen abrode in the skinne, the priest shall make hym vncleane: for it is a leprosie.
{13:9} When the plague of the leprosie is in a man, he shalbe brought vnto the priest.
{13:10} And the priest shall see hym: And yf the swellyng be whyte in the skynne, and haue made the heere whyte, and there be rawe fleshe in the swellyng,
{13:11} It wilbe an olde leprosie in the skynne of his fleshe, and the priest shall make hym vncleane, and shall not shut hym vp, seyng he is vncleane.
{13:12} If a leprosie breake out abrode in the skynne, and couer all the skynne from his head to his foote wheresoeuer the priest loketh,
{13:13} Then the priest shall consider: and yf the leprosie haue couered all his fleshe, he shall iudge the plague to be cleane, because it is all turned into whytenesse, and he shalbe cleane.
{13:14} But and if there be rawe fleshe on him when he is seene, he shalbe vncleane.
{13:15} And the priest shal see the rawe fleshe, and declare hym to be vncleane: for the rawe fleshe is vncleane, seyng it is a leprosie.
{13:16} Or yf the rawe fleshe turne agayne and chaunge vnto whyte, he shall come to the priest:
{13:17} And the priest shall see him: & behold, yf the sore be chaunged vnto whyte, the priest shall iudge the plague cleane, and he shalbe cleane.
{13:18} The fleshe also in whose skinne there is a byle, and is healed,
{13:19} And in the place of the byle there appeare a whyte rysyng, either a shynyng whyte and somewhat reddishe, it shall be seene of the priest.
{13:20} And yf when the priest seeth hym, it appeare lower then the skynne, and the heere therof be chaunged vnto whyte, the priest shall iudge hym vncleane: for it is a plagne of leprosie, broken out of the byle.
{13:21} But and yf the priest loke on it, and there be no whyte heeres therin, and yf it be not lower then the skynne, but be darker, the priest shall shut hym vp seuen dayes.
{13:22} And yf it spreade abrode in the skynne, the priest shall make hym vncleane, seyng it is a sore.
{13:23} But and yf the spot stande styll and growe not, it is a scarre of a byle, and therfore the priest shall declare hym to be cleane.
{13:24} If there be any fleshe in whose skynne there is a hotte burnyng, and the quicke fleshe that burneth haue a whyte spot, somewhat reddishe or whyte,
{13:25} The priest shall loke vpon it: and yf the heere in that bright spot be chauged to whyte, and it appeare lower then the skynne, it is a leprosie broken out of the burnyng, and therfore the priest shall iudge hym vncleane, seyng it is ye plague of leprosie.
{13:26} But yf the priest loke on it, and there be no whyte heere in the bryght spot, and be no lower then the other skynne, but be darker, the priest shall shut hym vp seuen dayes.
{13:27} And the priest shall loke on hym the seuenth day: and yf it be growen abrode in the skynne, the priest shall iudge hym vncleane, seyng it is ye plague of leprosie.
{13:28} And yf the spot stande styll in it, and growe not in the skynne, but is darke, it is a risyng of the burnyng, and the priest shall therfore declare hym cleane, seyng it is a scarre of the burnyng.
{13:29} If man or woman hath a sore vpon the head or the bearde,
{13:30} The priest shall see the sore: and yf it appeare lower then the skynne, and there be in it a yelowe heere and thinne, the priest shall iudge him vncleane, seing that the same frettyng is a token of leprosie vpon the head or bearde.
{13:31} And yf the priest loke on the sore of the fret, and it seeme not lower then the skynne, and that the heere is not blacke, the priest shall shut vp the frettyng sore seuen dayes.
{13:32} And in the seuenth day the priest shall loke on the sore: and yf the fret be not growen, and there be in it no yelowe heere, and the fret seeme not lower then the skynne,
{13:33} He shalbe shauen, but the fret shall he not shaue: and the priest shall shut vp the fret seuen dayes mo.
{13:34} And in the seuenth day the priest shall loke on the fret: and yf the fret be not growen in the skynne, nor seeme lower then the other skynne, the priest shall clense him: & he shall washe his clothes, and be cleane.
{13:35} But if the fret growe in the skynne after his clensyng,
{13:36} The priest shall loke on hym: and yf the fret be growen in the skynne, the priest shall not seeke for yelowe heere, for he is vncleane.
{13:37} But if he see the fret stande still, & that there is blacke heere growen vp therein, the fret is healed, & he shalbe cleane, & the priest shal declare him to be cleane.
{13:38} If there be many white spottes in the skinne of the fleshe of man or woman,
{13:39} The priest shall loke vpon it: and yf the spottes in the skynne of their fleshe be somewhat darke and whyte withal, it is a frekell growyng in the skynne: therfore he is cleane.
{13:40} And the man whose heere is fallen of his head, he is baulde, yet cleane.
{13:41} And he that hath his heere fallen of on the part of his head towarde his face, is forehead baulde, yet cleane.
{13:42} If there be in ye baulde head or baulde forehead a whyte reddishe sore, there is leprosie sprong vp in his baulde head or baulde forehead.
{13:43} And the priest shall loke vpon hym: & yf the rysyng of the sore be whyte reddishe in his baulde head or baulde forehead, after the maner of leprosie which is in the skynne of the fleshe,
{13:44} Then he is a leprous man & vncleane: And the priest shal make him vncleane, for the plague therof is in his head.
{13:45} The leper in whom the plague is, shal haue his clothes rent, & his head bare, & shall put a coueryng vpon his lippes, and shall crye: vncleane, vncleane.
{13:46} And as long as the disease lasteth vpon hym, he shalbe defiled and vncleane: he shall dwell alone, euen without the campe shall his habitation be.
{13:47} The garment also that the plague of leprosie is in, whether it be a woollen garment or a lynnen garment,
{13:48} Whether it be in the warpe or woofe of lynnen or of woollen, either in a skin, or any thyng made of skynne:
{13:49} If the disease be light greene, or somewhat reddishe in the garmet or skinne, whether it be in the warpe or woofe, or any thyng that is made of skinne: then it is a plague of leprosie, & shalbe shewed vnto the priest.
{13:50} The priest therfore shal see the plague, and shut it vp seuen dayes.
{13:51} And he shall loke on the plague the seuenth day: which, yf it be increased in the garment, whether it be in ye warpe or woofe, or in a skinne, or in any thyng that is made of skinne, it is the leprosie of a frettyng sore, it is vncleane.
{13:52} And he shall burne that garment, eyther warpe or woofe, whether it be woollen or lynnen, or any thyng that is made of skinne wherin the plague is, for it is a frettyng leprosie, it shalbe burnt in the fire.
{13:53} If the priest see that the plague is not growen in the garment, either in the warpe or woofe, or in whatsoeuer thing of skinne it be,
{13:54} The priest shall commaunde them to washe the thyng wherin the plague is, and he shall shut it vp seuen dayes mo.
{13:55} And the priest shall loke on the plague agayne after that it is wasshed: and yf the plague haue not chaunged his colour, and is spread no further abrode, it is vncleane, thou shalt burne it in the fire: for it is fret inwarde, whether it be bauld behynd in the head or before.
{13:56} And yf the priest see that the plague is darker after that is is wasshed, he shall cut it out of the garment or out of the skinne, or out of the warpe, or out of the woofe.
{13:57} And yf it appeare styll in the garment, either in the warpe, or in the woofe, or in any thyng made of skinne: it is a spreadyng plague, thou shalt burne that wherin the plague is, with fire.
{13:58} Moreouer the garment, either warpe or woofe, or whatsoeuer thing of skinne it be which thou hast wasshed, yf the plague be departed therfrom, it shalbe wasshed once agayne, and then it shalbe cleane.
{13:59} This is the lawe of the plague of leprosie in a garment whether it be woolen or lynnen, either in the warpe or woofe, or in any thyng of skinnes, to make it cleane or vncleane.
{14:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{14:2} This is the lawe of the leper in the day of his clensyng: He shalbe brought vnto the priest,
{14:3} And the priest shal go out without the campe, and the priest shall loke vpon hym, and yf the plague of leprosie be healed in the leper,
{14:4} Then shall the priest commaunde to take for hym that is clensed, two lyue birdes and cleane, and ceder wood, and a scarlet lase and ysope.
{14:5} And the priest shall commaunde that one of the birdes be killed in an earthen vessell, and vpon runnyng water.
{14:6} And he shall take the lyuyng birde, with the ceder wood, the scarlet lase and the ysope, and shall dippe them, and the liuing birde in the blood of the slaine birde vpon the runnyng water.
{14:7} And he shall sprinckle vpon hym that must be clensed of his leprosie seuen tymes, and clense hym, and shall let the lyuyng birde go free into the fielde.
{14:8} And he that is clensed shall washe his clothes, and shaue of all his heere, and washe hym selfe in water, that he may be cleane: And after that shall he come into the hoast, and shall tary without his tent seuen dayes:
{14:9} But in the seuenth day, he shall shaue of all his heere, namely his head, his bearde, and his browes, euen all his heere shalbe shauen of: And he shall washe his clothes, and also washe his fleshe in water, and he shalbe cleane.
{14:10} In the eyght day he shall take two hee lambes without blemishe, and an ewe lambe of a yere olde without blemishe, and three tenth deales of fine flowre for a meate offeryng myngled with oyle, and a logge of oyle.
{14:11} And the priest that maketh him cleane, shall bryng the man that is to be made cleane, & those thynges, before the Lord at the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{14:12} And the priest shall take one lambe, and offer hym for a trespasse offeryng, & the logge of oyle, and waue them for a waue offeryng before the Lorde.
{14:13} And he shal slea the lambe in the place where the sinne offeryng and the burnt offeryng are slayne, euen in the holy place: for as the sinne offeryng is the priestes, euen so is the trespasse offering, seyng it is most holy.
{14:14} And the priest shall take of the blood of the trespasse offering, and put it vpon the tippe of the ryght eare of hym that is to be clensed, and vpon the thumbe of his right hande, and vpon the great toe of his ryght foote.
{14:15} The priest shall take of the logge of oyle, and powre it into the paulme of his left hande:
{14:16} And he shall dippe his ryght finger in the oyle that is in his left hande, and sprinckle of the oyle with his finger seuen tymes before the Lorde.
{14:17} And of the rest of the oyle that is in his hande, shall the priest put vpon the tippe of the ryght eare of hym that is for to be clensed, and vpon the thumbe of his ryght hande, and vpon the great toe of his ryght foote, euen vpon the blood of the trespasse offeryng.
{14:18} And the remnaunt of the oyle that is in the priestes hande, he shal powre vpo the head of hym that is for to be clensed: and the priest shall make an attonement for hym before the Lorde.
{14:19} And the priest shall offer the sinne offeryng, and make an attonement for hym that is to be clensed from his vncleannesse, and then shall he kyll the burnt offeryng.
{14:20} And the priest shall offer the burnt offeryng and the meate offeryng vpon the aulter: and the priest shall make an attonement for hym, & he shalbe cleane.
{14:21} If he be poore and can not get so much, he shall take one lambe for a trespasse offering, to waue it for his attonement, and a tenth deale of fine flowre mingled with oyle for a meate offeryng, and a logge of oyle,
{14:22} And two turtle doues, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get: wherof the one shalbe for a sinne offeryng, and the other for a burnt offeryng.
{14:23} And he shall bryng them the eyght day for his clensyng vnto the priest before the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lorde.
{14:24} And the priest shall take the lambe that is for the trespasse offeryng, & the logge of oyle, and waue them for a waue offeryng before the Lorde.
{14:25} And he shal kill the lambe for the trespasse offeryng, and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespasse offeryng, and put it vpon the tippe of his right eare that is to be clensed, and vpon the thombe of his right hande, and vpon the great toe of his right foote.
{14:26} And the priest shall powre of the oyle into the paulme of his owne left hande:
{14:27} And the priest shall with his right finger, sprinckle of the oyle that is in his left hand, seuen tymes before the Lord.
{14:28} And the priest shal put of the oyle that is in his hande, vpon ye tippe of the right eare of hym that is to be clensed, & vpon the thombe of his right hande, and vpon the great toe of his right foote, euen in the place where the blood of the trespasse offeryng was put.
{14:29} And ye rest of the oyle yt is in the priestes hande, he shal put vpon the head of him that is to be clensed, that he may make an attonement for him before the Lord.
{14:30} And he shall offer one of the turtle doues, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get:
{14:31} Such I say as he is able to get: the one for a sinne offering, & the other for a burnt offeryng, with ye meate offeryng: And ye priest shall make an attonement for hym yt is to be clensed before ye Lord.
{14:32} This is the lawe of hym in whom is the plague of leprosie, and whose hande is not able to get that which pertaineth to his clensyng.
{14:33} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses and Aaron, saying:
{14:34} When ye be come vnto the lande of Chanaan, which I geue you in possession, and yf I put the plague of leprosie in a house of the land of your possession:
{14:35} He that oweth the house shall come, & tell the priest, saying: Me thinke that there is as it were a plague in ye house.
{14:36} Then the priest shall comaunde them to emptie the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made vncleane: and the must the priest go in, to see the house.
{14:37} And he shall see the plague: and yf the plague be in the walles of the house, & that there be hollowe strakes, greenish or reddishe, which seeme to be lower then the wall it selfe:
{14:38} Then the priest shall go out of ye house, to the doore of the house, and shut vp the house seuen dayes.
{14:39} And the priest shall come agayne the seuenth day, & yf he see that the plague be increased in the walles of the house,
{14:40} Then the priest shall comaunde them to take away ye stones in which ye plague is, and let them cast them into a foule place without the citie,
{14:41} And he shall commaunde the house to be scraped within rounde about, and powre out the dust that they scrape of, without the citie into a foule place.
{14:42} And they shall take other stones, and put the in the place of those stones, and other morter to plaster ye house withall.
{14:43} And if the plague come againe, & breake out in the house after that he hath taken away the stones and scraped the house, & after that he hath plastered the house,
{14:44} Then the priest shall come and see it: & yf that the plague hath growen further in the house, it is a frettyng leprosie in the house, it is therfore vncleane.
{14:45} And he shall breake downe the house, and the stones of it, and the timber therof, and all the morter of the house: and he shall cary them out of the citie into a foule place.
{14:46} Moreouer, he that goeth into ye house all the whyle that it is shut vp, shalbe vncleane vntyll the euen.
{14:47} He also that sleepeth in the house, shal washe his clothes: he lykewyse that eateth in ye house, shall washe his clothes.
{14:48} And yf the priest come and see that the plague hath spread no further in ye house after that it is newe plastered: the priest shall iudge that house cleane, because the plague is healed.
{14:49} And let hym take to clense the house withall, two birdes, ceder wood, and a scarlet lase and ysope.
{14:50} And he shal kill one of the birdes in an earthen vessell, & vpon runnyng water:
{14:51} And take the ceder wood, and the ysope, and the scarlet lase with the lyuyng birde, and dippe them in the blood of the slayne birde, and in the runnyng water, & sprinckle the house seue tymes.
{14:52} And he shall clense the house with the blood of ye birde, & with the running water, with the liuing birde, with the ceder wood, & the ysope, and the scarlet lase.
{14:53} But he shall let the lyuyng birde flee out of the towne into the brode fieldes, & so make an attonement for the house, and it shalbe cleane.
{14:54} This is the lawe for all maner plague of leprosie and fret,
{14:55} And of the leprosie of garment & house,
{14:56} For a swellyng, for a scabbe, and for a shynyng whyte,
{14:57} To teache when it must be made vncleane, and cleane: this is the lawe of leprosie.
{15:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses and Aaron, saying:
{15:2} Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them: Whosoeuer hath a runnyng issue out of his fleshe, is vncleane by reason of that issue.
{15:3} And this shalbe his vncleannesse in his issue: if his fleshe runne, or yf his fleshe be stopped from his issue, then it is vncleannesse.
{15:4} Euery bed wheron he lyeth that hath the issue, is vncleane: and euery thyng wheron he sitteth, is vncleane.
{15:5} Whosoeuer toucheth his bed, shall washe his clothes and bath hymselfe in water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:6} And he that sitteth on any thing wheron he sat that hath the issue, shal washe his clothes, and bath him selfe in water, and be vncleane vntyll the euenyng.
{15:7} He that toucheth the fleshe of him that hath the issue, shall washe his clothes, and bathe hym selfe in water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:8} If he also that hath the issue, spyt vpon hym that is cleane, he shall washe his clothes, and bath himselfe in water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:9} And what saddle soeuer he rydeth vpon that hath ye issue, shalbe vncleane.
{15:10} And whosoeuer toucheth any thyng that was vnder hym, shalbe vncleane vnto the euen: And he that beareth any such thynges shall washe his clothes, and bathe hym selfe in water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:11} And whosoeuer he toucheth that hath the issue, and haue not wasshed his handes in water, shall washe his clothes and bathe hym selfe in water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:12} The vessell of earth that he toucheth which hath the issue, shalbe broken: and all vessels of wood shalbe rensed in water.
{15:13} When he also that hath any issue, is clensed of his issue, he shall number him seuen dayes for his clensyng, and washe his clothes, and bathe his fleshe in runnyng water, and so shall he be cleane.
{15:14} And the eyght day he shall take to hym two turtle doues, or two young pigeons, and come before the Lorde vnto the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation, & geue them vnto the priest.
{15:15} And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sinne offeryng, and the other for a burnt offeryng: and the priest shall make an attonement for hym before the Lorde, as concernyng his issue.
{15:16} If any mans seede depart fro hym in his sleepe, he shall washe all his fleshe in water, and be vncleane vntyll ye euen.
{15:17} And euery garment, and euery skinne wherin is such seede of sleepe, shalbe wasshed with water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:18} And if he yt hath such an issue of seede, do lye with a woman, they shall both washe them selues with water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:19} Also yf a woman shall haue an issue, and her issue in her fleshe shalbe blood, she shalbe put apart seuen dayes: whosoeuer toucheth her, shalbe vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:20} And all that she lyeth vpon in ye tyme of her seperation, shalbe vncleane: lyke as euery thing also that she sitteth vpon, is vncleane.
{15:21} Whosoeuer toucheth her bed, shall washe his clothes, and bathe hym selfe with water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:22} And whosoeuer toucheth any thyng that she sat vpon, shall washe his clothes, and bathe hym selfe in water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:23} So that whether he touche her bed, or any vessell wheron she hath sytten, he shalbe vncleane vntyll the euenyng.
{15:24} And yf a man lye with her, and her seperation come vpon hym, he shalbe vncleane seuen dayes: and all the bedde wheron he lyeth shalbe vncleane.
{15:25} Also if a woman haue an issue of her blood many dayes, out of the tyme of her seperation, or if it runne beyond her seperation, let all the dayes of the issue of her vncleanenesse, be euen as ye dayes of her seperation, for she is vncleane.
{15:26} Euery bedde whereon she lyeth as long as her issue lasteth, shalbe vnto her as the bedde of her seperation: and whatsoeuer she sitteth vpon shalbe vncleane, as the vncleanenesse of her seperation.
{15:27} And whosoeuer toucheth any of these shalbe vncleane, and shall washe his clothes, and bathe hym selfe in water, and be vncleane vntyll the euen.
{15:28} But if she be cleansed of her issue, she shall count her seuen dayes: and after that, she shalbe cleane.
{15:29} And in the eyght day, she shall take vnto her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bryng them vnto the priest, before the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{15:30} And the priest shall offer the one for a sinne offeryng, and the other for a burnt offeryng, and make an attonement for her before the Lord, as concernyng the issue of her vncleanenesse.
{15:31} Thus shall ye syft the chyldren of Israel from their vncleanenesse, that they dye not in their vncleanenesse: if they defyle my tabernacle that is among the.
{15:32} This is the lawe of hym that hath an issue, and of hym whose seede runneth from hym in his sleepe, and is defyled therin:
{15:33} Also of her that for her seperation is put apart, & of whosoeuer hath a runnyng issue, whether it be man or woman, and of hym that lyeth with her which is vncleane.
{16:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses after the death of ye two sonnes of Aaron, when they offered before ye Lorde, and dyed.
{16:2} And the Lorde sayde vnto Moyses: Speake vnto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all tymes into the holy place within the vayle, before the mercie seate which is vpon the arke, that he dye not: For I wyll appeare in the cloude vpon ye mercie seate.
{16:3} But with this thyng shal Aaron come into the holy place: euen with a young bullocke for a sinne offeryng, and with a ramme for a burnt offeryng.
{16:4} He shall put the holy lynnen coate vpon hym, and shall haue lynnen breeches vpon his fleshe, and shalbe girded with a lynnen girdle, and with a lynnen cap shall he be attired. These are holy garmentes: therfore shall he washe his fleshe in water when he doth put them on.
{16:5} And he shall take of the congregation of the childre of Israel, two hee goates for a sinne offeryng, and a ramme for a burnt offeryng.
{16:6} And Aaron shall offer his bullocke for his sinne offering, and make an attonement for hym and for his house.
{16:7} And he shall take the two hee goates, and present them before the Lorde at the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{16:8} And Aaron shall cast lottes ouer the two goates: one lot shalbe for the Lord, and the other for the scape goate.
{16:9} And Aaron shall bryng the goate vpon which the Lordes lot fell, and offer hym for a sinne offeryng.
{16:10} But the goate on which the lot fell to be the scape goate, shalbe set aliue before the Lorde to reconcile with, and to let hym go as a scape goate into the wildernesse.
{16:11} And Aaron shall bryng the bullocke for his sinne offeryng, and reconcile for hym selfe and for his house, and shall kyll the bullocke for his sinne offeryng.
{16:12} And he shall take a censer full of burning coales from of the aulter before the Lorde, and shall fill his hand full of sweete incense beaten small, and bryng them within the vayle.
{16:13} And put the incense vpon the fire before the Lorde, that the cloude of the incense may couer the mercy seate that is vpon the witnesse, and he shall not dye.
{16:14} And he shall take of the blood of the bullocke, and sprinckle it with his finger vpon the mercy seate eastward: and before the mercy seate shall he sprinckle of the blood with his finger seuen tymes.
{16:15} Then shall he kyll the goate that is the peoples sinne offering, & bryng his blood within the vayle, & do with that blood as he dyd with the blood of the bullocke, sprinklyng it vpon the mercy seate, and before the mercy seate.
{16:16} And he shall reconcile the holy place from the vncleannesses of the chyldren of Israel, and from their trespasses in all their sinnes: And so shal he do for the tabernacle of the congregation that is set among them, euen among their vncleannesses.
{16:17} And let there be no body in the tabernacle of the cogregation when he goeth in to make an attonement in the holy place, vntyll he come out, and haue made an attonement for hym selfe, and for his housholde, and for all the congregation of Israel.
{16:18} And he shall go out vnto the aulter that is before the Lorde, and reconcile vpon it, and shal take of the blood of the bullocke, and of the blood of the goate, and put it vpon the hornes of the aulter rounde about.
{16:19} So shall he sprinckle of the blood vpon it with his finger seuen tymes, and cleanse it, & halowe it from the vncleannesse of the chyldren of Israel.
{16:20} And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the aulter, he shall bryng the liue goate.
{16:21} And Aaron shall put both his handes vpon the head of the liue goate, and confesse ouer hym all the misdeedes of the chyldren of Israel, and all their trespasses in all their sinnes, puttyng them vppon the head of the goate, and send him away by the hand of a conuenient man, into the wyldernesse.
{16:22} And the goate shall beare vpon hym all theyr misdeedes vnto the lande of seperation, and he shall let the goate go into the wyldernesse.
{16:23} After Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and put of the linnen clothes whiche he put on when he went in into the holy place, and leaue them there.
{16:24} And let hym washe his fleshe with water in the holy place, and put on his owne rayment, and then come out, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an attonement for hym selfe, and for the people.
{16:25} And the fat of the sinne offering shall he burne vpon the aulter.
{16:26} And he that caryed foorth the goate for the scape goate, shall washe his clothes, and bathe his fleshe in water, and then come into the hoast.
{16:27} And the bullocke for the sinne offering, & the goate for the sinne offering, whose blood was brought in to clense the holy place, shall one cary out without the hoast to be burnt in the fire, with their skinnes, their fleshe, and their dounge.
{16:28} And he that burneth them, shall wash his clothes, and bathe his fleshe in water, and then come into the hoast.
{16:29} And this shalbe an ordinaunce for euer vnto you: that in the tenth day of the seuenth moneth ye humble your soules, and do no worke at all, whether it be one of your owne countrey, or a straunger that soiourneth among you.
{16:30} For that day shall the priest make an attonement for you to cleanse you, and that ye may be cleane from all your sinnes before the Lorde.
{16:31} Let it be a Sabbath of rest vnto you, and ye shall humble your soules by an ordinaunce for euer.
{16:32} And the priest whom he shal annoynt, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in his fathers steade, shal make the attonement, and shall put on the linnen clothes, and holy vestmentes.
{16:33} And shall reconcile the holy sanctuarie, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall cleanse the aulter, & make an attonement, for the priestes, and for all the people of the congregation.
{16:34} And this shalbe an euerlastyng ordinaunce vnto you, to make an attonement for the chyldren of Israel for all their sinnes once a yere. And he dyd as the Lorde commaunded Moyses.
{17:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{17:2} Speake vnto Aaron and vnto his sonnes, and vnto all the chyldren of Israel, and say vnto them: This is the thing whiche the Lorde hath charged, saying:
{17:3} What man soeuer of the house of Israel kylleth an oxe, or lambe, or goate in the hoast, or that kylleth it out of the hoast,
{17:4} And bryngeth it not vnto the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering vnto the Lorde before the dwelling place of the Lord, blood shalbe imputed vnto that man, he hath shed blood, and that man shalbe cut of from among his people.
{17:5} Wherfore, when the chyldren of Israel bryng their offeringes that they offer in the wylde fielde, they shall bryng them vnto the Lorde, euen vnto the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation by the priest, to offer them for peace offeringes vnto the Lorde.
{17:6} And the priest shall sprinckle the blood vpon the aulter of the Lorde, whiche is before the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burne the fat for a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde.
{17:7} And let them no more offer their offeringes vnto deuyls, after whom they haue gone a whoryng: This shalbe an ordinaunce for euer vnto them in their generations.
{17:8} And thou shalt say vnto them: Whatsoeuer man it be of the house of Israel, or of the straungers whiche soiourne among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,
{17:9} And bryngeth it not vnto the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer it vnto the Lorde: that man shalbe cut of from among his people.
{17:10} And whatsoeuer man it be of the house of Israel, or of the straungers that soiourne among you, that eateth any maner of blood, I wyll set my face against that soule that eateth blood, and wyll cut hym of from among his people:
{17:11} For the life of the fleshe is in the blood, and I haue geuen it vnto you vpon the aulter, to make an attonement for your soules: for this blood shall make an attonement for the soule.
{17:12} Therfore I sayd vnto the chyldren of Israel: Let no soule of you eate blood, neither let any straunger that soiourneth among you, eate blood.
{17:13} And whatsoeuer man it be of the chyldren of Israel, or of the straungers that soiourne among you, whiche hunteth and catcheth any beast or foule that may be eaten, let hym powre out the blood thereof, and couer it with dust.
{17:14} For the lyfe of the fleshe is the blood of it ioyned with his lyfe: therefore I sayde vnto the chyldren of Israel, ye shal eate the blood of no maner of flesh, for the life of all fleshe is the blood therof: whosoeuer eateth it, shalbe cut of.
{17:15} And euery soule that eateth it whiche dyed alone, or that whiche was torne with wylde beastes, whether it be one of your owne countrey, or a straunger, he shall washe his clothes, and bathe hym selfe in water, and be vncleane vnto the euen: and then shall he be cleane.
{17:16} If he washe them not, nor bathe his fleshe, he shall beare his sinne.
{18:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{18:2} Speake vnto the chyldren of Israel, and say vnto them: I am the Lorde your God.
{18:3} After the doynges of the lande of Egypt wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doinges of the lande of Chanaan whyther I wyll bryng you, shall ye not do: neither walke in their ordinaunces.
{18:4} But do after my iudgementes, and kepe mine ordinaunces, to walke therin: I am the Lorde your God.
{18:5} Ye shall kepe therfore mine ordinaunces, and my iudgementes: which if a man do he shall lyue in them: I am the Lorde.
{18:6} None shall approche to any kinred of his fleshe, for to vncouer their nakednesse: I am the Lorde.
{18:7} The nakednesse of thy father, & the nakednesse of thy mother shalt thou not vncouer, for she is thy mother: therfore shalt thou not discouer her nakednesse.
{18:8} The nakednesse of thy fathers wife shalt thou not discouer: for it is thy fathers nakednesse.
{18:9} Thou shalt not discouer the nakednesse of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, whether she be borne at home, or without.
{18:10} Thou shalt not vncouer the nakednesse of thy sonnes daughter, or thy daughters daughter, for that is thyne owne nakednesse.
{18:11} The nakednesse of thy fathers wiues daughter begotten of thy father, which is thy sister: thou shalt not discouer her nakednesse.
{18:12} Thou shalt not vncouer the nakednesse of thy fathers sister: for she is thy fathers kinswoman.
{18:13} Thou shalt not discouer the nakednesse of thy mothers sister: for she is thy mothers kinswoman.
{18:14} Thou shalt not vncouer the nakednesse of thy fathers brother, that is, thou shalt not go in vnto his wyfe, whiche is thyne aunt.
{18:15} Thou shalt not discouer ye nakednesse of thy daughter in lawe, for she is thy sonnes wyfe: therefore shalt thou not vncouer her nakednesse.
{18:16} Thou shalt not vncouer the nakednesse of thy brothers wife, for that is thy brothers nakednesse.
{18:17} Thou shalt not discouer the nakednesse of the wyfe and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her sonnes daughter, or her daughters daughter, to vncouer their nakednesse: For they are her kinswomen, and it were wickednesse.
{18:18} Thou shalt not take a wyfe and her sister also, to vexe her, that thou wouldest vncouer her nakednesse vpon her in her lyfe tyme.
{18:19} Thou shalt also not go vnto a woman to vncouer her nakednesse, as long as she is put apart for her vncleannesse.
{18:20} Moreouer, thou shalt not lye with thy neighbours wyfe, to defile her with seede.
{18:21} Thou shalt also not geue of thy seede to offer it vnto Moloch, neither shalt thou defile the name of thy God: I am the Lorde.
{18:22} Thou shalt not lye with mankynde as with womankynde, for it is abhomination.
{18:23} Thou shalt lye with no maner of beast to defile thy selfe therwith: neither shall any woman stande before a beast to lye downe therto, for it is vnnaturall confusion.
{18:24} Ye shall not defile your selues in any of these thinges: for in all these, the nations are defiled whiche I cast out before you.
{18:25} Wherthrough the lande is defiled, and I wyll visite the wyckednesse thereof vpon it, yea and the lande it selfe hath vomited out her inhabitauntes.
{18:26} Ye shall kepe therfore mine ordinaunces and my iudgementes, and commit none of these abhominations, neither any of your owne nation, nor any strauger that soiourneth among you:
{18:27} (For all these abhominations, haue the men of the lande done whiche were before you, and the lande is defiled.)
{18:28} Shall not the lande spewe you out also if ye defile it, as it spewed out the nations that were before you?
{18:29} For whosoeuer shall commit any of these abhominations, the same soules that commit them shall be cut of from among their people.
{18:30} Therefore shall ye kepe myne ordinaunces, that ye commit not one of these abhominable customes whiche were committed before you, and that ye defile not your selues therein: I am the Lorde your God.
{19:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{19:2} Speake vnto all the congregation of ye chyldren of Israel, and say vnto them: Ye shalbe holy, for I the Lorde your God am holy.
{19:3} Ye shall feare euery man his mother and his father, & kepe my Sabbathes: I am the Lorde your God.
{19:4} Ye shal not looke vnto idols, nor make you moulten goddes: I am the Lorde your God.
{19:5} If ye offer a peace offering vnto the Lorde, ye shall offer it at your pleasure.
{19:6} It shalbe eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morowe: And if ought remayne vntyll the thirde day, it shalbe burnt in the fire.
{19:7} And if it be eaten the thirde day, it is vncleane, and not accepted.
{19:8} Therfore he that eateth it, shall beare his sinne, because he hath defiled the halowed thing of the Lord, and that soule shalbe cut of from among his people.
{19:9} When ye reape the haruest of your land, thou shalt not thorowly reape the corners of the fielde, neither shalt thou gather the gleaninges of thy haruest.
{19:10} Thou shalt not dishonest thy vineyarde, neither gather in thorowly the grapes of thy vineyarde, but thou shalt leaue them for the poore and straunger: I am the Lorde your God.
{19:11} Ye shall not steale, neither deale falselye, neither lye one to another.
{19:12} Ye shall not sweare by my name falsely, neither shalt thou defile the name of thy God: I am the Lorde.
{19:13} Thou shalt not do thy neighbour wrong, neither rob hym, neither shall the workmans hyre abyde with thee vntyll the mornyng.
{19:14} Thou shalt not despise the deafe, neither put a stumblyng blocke before the blynde, but shalt feare thy God: I am the Lorde.
{19:15} Ye shall do no vnrighteousnesse in iudgement, thou shalt not fauour the person poore, nor honour the person mightie, but in righteousnes shalt thou iudge thy neighbour.
{19:16} Thou shalt not go vp and downe with tales among thy people, neither shalt thou stande agaynst the blood of thy neighbour: I am the Lorde.
{19:17} Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thyne heart, but shalt in any wyse rebuke thy neighbour, & suffer not sinne vpon hym.
{19:18} Thou shalt not auenge nor wayte to do displeasure agaynst the chyldren of thy people, but shalt loue thy neighbour euen as thy selfe: I am the Lorde.
{19:19} Ye shal kepe mine ordinaunces. Thou shalt not let cattell gender with a contrary kinde, neither sow thy fielde with mingled seede, neither shalt thou put on any mingled garment of linnen and wollen.
{19:20} Whosoeuer lieth and medleth with a woman that is a bondmayde betrothed to a husbande, but not redeemed, nor freedome geue her, she shalbe scourged, but they shall not dye, because she was not free.
{19:21} And he shall bryng for his trespasse vnto the Lorde, before the doore of the tabernacle of ye congregation, a Ramme for a trespasse offering.
{19:22} And the priest shall make an attonement for hym with the Ramme which is for the trespasse before the Lord, concernyng his sinne whiche he hath done: and the sinne which he hath done, shalbe forgeuen him.
{19:23} When ye come to the lande, and haue planted all maner of trees conuenient to be eaten of, ye shall counte the fruite thereof as vncircumcized: euen three yere shall they be vncircumcized vnto you, and shall not be eaten of.
{19:24} But in the fourth yere, all the fruite of them shalbe holy and commendable to the Lorde.
{19:25} In the fifth yere shall ye eate of the fruite thereof, that it may yeelde vnto you the encrease thereof: I am the Lorde your God.
{19:26} Ye shall not eate vpon blood, neither shall ye vse witchcraft, nor obserue tymes.
{19:27} Ye shall not rounde the corners of your heades, neither shalt thou marre the tuftes of thy bearde.
{19:28} Ye shall not rent your fleshe for any soules sake, nor print any markes vpon you: I am the Lorde.
{19:29} Thou shalt not make thy daughter common, that thou wouldest cause her to be an whore, lest the lande also fall to whoredome, and become ful of wickednesse.
{19:30} Ye shall kepe my Sabbathes, & feare my sanctuarie: I am the Lorde.
{19:31} Ye shall not regarde them that worke with spirites, neither seeke after soothsayers to be defiled by them: I am the Lorde your God.
{19:32} Thou shalt ryse vp before the hore head, and reuerence the face of the olde man, and dreade thy God: I am the Lorde.
{19:33} If a straunger soiourne with thee in your lande, ye shall not vexe hym.
{19:34} But the straunger that dwelleth with you, shalbe as one of your owne nation, and thou shalt loue hym as thy selfe, for ye were straungers in the lande of Egypt: I am the Lorde your God.
{19:35} Ye shall do no vnrighteousnesse in iudgement, in metyarde, in wayght, or in measure.
{19:36} True balaunces, true wayghtes, a true Epha, and a true Hin shal ye haue: I am the Lorde your GOD whiche brought you out of the lande of Egypt.
{19:37} Therfore shall ye obserue all my ordinaunces, and al my iudgementes, and do them: I am the Lorde.
{20:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{20:2} This shalt thou say to the chyldren of Israel: whosoeuer he be of the chyldren of Israel, or of the straungers that dwell in Israel, that geueth of his chyldren vnto Moloch, let hym be slayne: the people of the lande shall ouerwhelme hym with stones.
{20:3} And I wyl set my face agaynst that man, and wyll cut hym of from among his people, because he hath geuen his chyldren vnto Moloch, for to defile my sanctuarie, & to pollute my holy name.
{20:4} And though that the people of the lande hyde their eyes from the man that geueth his chyldren vnto Moloch, and kyll hym not:
{20:5} I wyll put my face agaynst that man, and agaynst his kynred, and wyll cut hym of, and all that go a whoring after hym to commit whordome with Moloch, from among their people.
{20:6} If a soule turne hym selfe after suche as worke with spirites, and after soothsayers, to go a whoring after them, I wyll put my face agaynst that soule, and wyll cut hym of fro among his people.
{20:7} Sanctifie your selues therefore and be holy: for I am the Lorde your God.
{20:8} Kepe ye myne ordinaunces, and do them: I am the Lorde whiche sanctifie you.
{20:9} Whosoeuer he be that despiseth his father or his mother, let hym dye: for he hath deminished the estimation of his father & mother, his blood be vpon him.
{20:10} And the man that breaketh wedlocke with another mans wyfe, euen he that breaketh wedlocke with his neyghbours wyfe, let be slayne both the adulterer and the adultresse.
{20:11} And the man that lyeth with his fathers wyfe, and vncouereth his fathers nakednes, let them both die, their blood be vpon them.
{20:12} If a man lye with his daughter in lawe, let them dye both of them: they haue wrought abhomination, their blood be vpon them.
{20:13} If a man also lye with mankinde after the maner as with women kynde, they haue both committed an abhomination: let them dye, their blood be vpon them.
{20:14} And if a man take a wyfe, and her mother also, it is wickednesse: They shall burne with fire both hym & them, that there be no wickednesse among you.
{20:15} And if a man lye with a beast, let hym dye, and ye shall slea the beast also.
{20:16} If a woman go vnto any beast, and lye downe thereto, thou shalt kyll the woman and the beast also: let them dye, their blood be vpon them.
{20:17} If a man take his sister, his fathers daughter, or his mothers daughter, & see her nakednesse, and she his nakednesse, it is a wicked thing, they shalbe cut of in the sight of their people: he hath vncouered his sisters nakednesse, he shall beare his sinne.
{20:18} If a man lye with a woman hauing her natural disease, and vncouer her nakednesse, and open her fountayne, and she also open the foutayne of her blood, they shall both be cut of from among their people.
{20:19} Thou shalt not vncouer the nakednesse of thy mothers sister, nor of thy fathers sister: for he that doth so, hath vncouered his next kyn, they shal beare their misdoyng.
{20:20} If a man lye with his vncles wyfe, and vncouer his vncles nakednesse, they shall beare their sinne, and shall dye chyldlesse.
{20:21} If a man take his brothers wyfe, it is an vncleane thyng: he hath vncouered his brothers nakednesse, they shalbe chyldlesse.
{20:22} Ye shall kepe therefore all myne ordinaunces, and all my iudgementes, and do them: that the lande whyther I bryng you to dwell therein, spewe you not out.
{20:23} Ye shall not walke in the maners of this nation, whiche I caste out before you: For they committed all these thinges, and therfore I abhorred the.
{20:24} But I haue sayde vnto you, ye shall enherite their lande, and I wyll geue it vnto you to possesse it, euen a lande that floweth with mylke and hony: I am the Lorde your God, whiche haue seperated you from other nations.
{20:25} And therefore shall ye put difference betweene cleane beastes and vncleane, betweene vncleane foules and cleane: Ye shal not defile your soules in beastes and foules, and in all maner creeping thinges that the grounde bryngeth foorth, whiche I haue seperated from you as vncleane.
{20:26} Therfore shall ye be holy vnto me, for I the Lorde am holy, and haue seuered you from other nations, that ye shoulde be myne.
{20:27} If there be a man or woman that worketh with a spirit, or that is a soothsayer, let them dye: Men shall ouerwhelme them with stones, their blood be vpon them.
{21:1} And the Lorde sayde vnto Moyses, Speake vnto the priestes the sonnes of Aaron, & say vnto them: Let none be defiled by a corse among his people:
{21:2} But by his kynsman that is nye vnto him, that is by his mother and his father, by his sonne, and his daughter, and his brother,
{21:3} And by his sister a mayde that is nye vnto hym, whom no man hath knowe: for her shall he be defiled.
{21:4} But he shall not be defiled vpon hym that hath aucthoritie among his people, to pollute him selfe.
{21:5} Let them not make baldnesse vpon their head, nor shaue of ye lockes of their bearde, nor make any cuttinges in their fleshe.
{21:6} They shalbe holy vnto their God, and not pollute the name of their God, for the sacrifices of the Lorde made by fire, and the bread of their God they do offer, therfore they shall be holy.
{21:7} Let them not take a wyfe that is an whore, or polluted, nor put from her husband: for such a one is holy vnto his god.
{21:8} Thou shalt sanctifie hym therfore, for he offereth vp the bread of thy God: he shall therefore be holy vnto thee, for I the Lorde which sanctifie you, am holy.
{21:9} If a priestes daughter fall to play the whore, she polluteth her father, therefore must she be burnt with fire.
{21:10} He that is the hie priest among his brethren, vpon whose head the annoynting oyle was powred, and that consecrated his hand to put on ye vestments, shal not vncouer his head, nor rent his clothes:
{21:11} Neither go to any dead body, nor make hymselfe vncleane by his father or his mother.
{21:12} Neither shall go out of the sanctuarie, nor pollute the holy place of his God, for the crowne of the annoynting oyle of his God, is vpon him: I am the Lord.
{21:13} He shall take a mayde vnto his wife.
{21:14} But a wydowe, a deuorsed woman, or a polluted, or a harlot, these shall he not marrie: but shall take a mayde of his owne people to wyfe.
{21:15} Neither shal he defile his seede among his people: for I am the Lorde whiche sanctifie hym.
{21:16} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{21:17} Speake vnto Aaron, and say: Whosoeuer of thy seede in their generations hath any deformitie, let hym not prease for to offer bread vnto his God:
{21:18} For whosoeuer hath any blemishe, shall not come neare: as if he be blynde or lame, or that hath a brused nose, or that hath any misshapen member:
{21:19} Or is broken footed, or broken handed,
{21:20} Or is crooke backt, or bleare eyed, or haue a webbe or other blemishe in his eyes, or be skuruie, or skabbed, or hath his stones broken:
{21:21} No man that hath a blemishe, & is of the seede of Aaron the priest, shall come nye to offer the sacrifices of the Lorde made by fire: When he hath a deformitie, let him not prease to offer the bread of his God.
{21:22} Let him eate the bread of his God, euen of the most holy, and of the holy:
{21:23} Only let him not go in vnto ye vayle, nor come nye the aulter, because he is deformed, that he pollute not my sanctuarie: for I am the Lorde that sanctifie them.
{21:24} And Moyses tolde it vnto Aaron and to his sonnes, and vnto all the chyldren of Israel.
{22:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{22:2} Speake vnto Aaron and his sonnes, that they be seperated from the holy thinges of the children of Israel, and that they pollute not my holy name in those thinges whiche they halowe vnto me: I am the Lorde.
{22:3} Say vnto them: Whosoeuer he be of all your seede among your generations after you, that goeth vnto the holy thinges whiche the chyldren of Israel halowe vnto the Lorde, hauing his vncleannes vpon hym, that soule shall be cut of from out of my sight: I am the Lorde.
{22:4} What man soeuer of the seede of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue, he shall not eate of the holy thinges, vntyll he be cleane: And who so toucheth any man that is vncleane by reason of a dead body, or a man whose seede runneth from hym in his sleepe,
{22:5} Or whosoeuer toucheth any creeping thyng, whereby he may be made vncleane, or a man, of whom he may take vncleannes, whatsoeuer vncleannes he hath:
{22:6} The same soule that hath touched any suche, shalbe vncleane vntyll euen, and shall not eate of the holy thynges, vntyll he haue washed his fleshe with water.
{22:7} And when the sunne is downe, he shalbe cleane, and shall afterwarde eate of the holy thynges, forasmuche as it is his foode.
{22:8} Of a beast that dyeth alone, or is rent with wylde beastes, wherby he may be defiled, he shall not eate: I am the Lorde.
{22:9} Let them kepe therefore myne ordinaunce, lest they for the same lade sinne vpon them, and dye for it, if they defile it: I the Lorde sanctifie them.
{22:10} There shall no straunger eate of the holy thing, neither a ghest of ye priestes, neither shall an hyred seruaunt eate of the holy thyng.
{22:11} But if the priest bye any soule with money, he shall eate of it, like as he that is borne in his house: they shall eate of his meate.
{22:12} If the priestes daughter also be maried vnto a staunger, she may not eate of the halowed heaue offeringes:
{22:13} Notwithstanding, if ye priestes daughter be a wydowe or deuorsed, and haue no chylde, but is returned vnto her fathers house agayne, she shall eate of her fathers meate, aswell as she dyd it in her youth: But there shall no straunger eate therof.
{22:14} If a man eate of the holy thyng vnwittingly, he shal put the fifth part thervnto, and geue it vnto the priest with the halowed thyng.
{22:15} And the priestes shall not defile the holy thynges of the chyldren of Israel, whiche they offer vnto the Lorde:
{22:16} To lade them selues with misdoyng and trespasse while they eate their holy thinges: for I the Lorde do halowe them.
{22:17} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{22:18} Speake vnto Aaron and his sonnes, and vnto all the children of Israel, and say vnto them: Whatsoeuer he be of the house of Israel, or straunger in Israel, that wyll offer his sacrifice for all his vowes, and for all his freewyll offeringes whiche they wyll offer vnto the Lorde for a burnt offering:
{22:19} Ye shall offer at your pleasure, a male without blemishe, of the beefes, of the sheepe, or of the goates.
{22:20} But whatsoeuer hath a blemishe, that shall ye not offer: for it shal not be acceptable for you.
{22:21} And whosoeuer bryngeth a peace offering vnto the Lorde, to accomplyshe his vowe, or a freewyll offering in beefes or sheepe, it shalbe perfite to be accepted, there shalbe also no blemishe therein.
{22:22} Blynde, or broken, or lame, or hauyng a wen, or skuruie, or scabbed, ye shall not offer suche vnto the Lorde, nor put a burnt offering of any suche vpon the aulter vnto the Lorde.
{22:23} A bullocke or a sheepe that hath any member superfluous or lackyng, mayest thou offer for a freewyll offering: but for a vowe it shall not be accepted.
{22:24} Ye shall not offer vnto the Lord that which is brused, or crusshed, or broken, or cut away, neither shal you make any offeryng therof in your lande.
{22:25} Neither of a straungers hande shall ye offer the bread of your God of any such, because their corruption is in the, and they haue deformitie in the selues: and therfore shall they not be accepted for you.
{22:26} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{22:27} When a bullocke, or a sheepe, or a goate is brought foorth, it shalbe seuen dayes vnder the damme: And from the eyght day and thencefoorth, it shalbe accepted for a burnt sacrifice vnto the Lorde.
{22:28} And whether it be cowe or ewe, ye shall not kyll it and her young both in one day.
{22:29} When ye wyll offer a thanke offeryng vnto the Lorde, offer it wyllyngly:
{22:30} And the same day it must be eaten vp, so that ye leaue none of it vntyll the morowe: I am the Lorde.
{22:31} Therfore shall ye kepe my comaundementes and do them: I am the Lorde.
{22:32} Neither shal ye pollute my holy name, but I wyll be halowed among the children of Israel: I am the Lorde which halowe you,
{22:33} And that brought you out of the lande of Egypt to be your God: I am the Lorde.
{23:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{23:2} Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto the: The feastes of the Lorde which ye shall call holy conuocations, euen these are my feastes.
{23:3} Sixe dayes ye shall worke: but the seuenth day is the Sabboth of rest, an holy couocation, so that ye do no worke therin: it is the Sabboth of the Lorde in all your dwellynges.
{23:4} These are the feastes of the Lorde, euen holy conuocations, which ye shall proclayme in their seasons.
{23:5} In the fourteenth day of the first moneth at euen, is the Lordes Passouer:
{23:6} And on the fifteenth day of the same moneth, is the feast of vnleauened bread vnto the Lorde: seuen dayes ye must eate vnleauened bread.
{23:7} In the first day ye shall haue an holy conuocation: ye shal do no seruile worke therin.
{23:8} But ye shall offer sacrifices made by fire vnto the Lorde throughout these seuen dayes: and in the seuenth day is an holy conuocation, ye shall do no seruile worke therin.
{23:9} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{23:10} Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them: When ye be come into the lande which I geue vnto you, and reape downe the haruest therof, ye shall bryng a sheafe of the first fruites of your haruest vnto the priest:
{23:11} Which shall waue the sheafe before the Lorde, to be accepted for you: and euen the morowe after the Sabboth the priest shall waue it.
{23:12} And ye shall offer that day when ye waue the sheafe, an hee lambe without blemishe of a yere olde, for a burnt offeryng vnto the Lorde:
{23:13} And the meate offeryng therof, shalbe made of two tenth deales of fine floure myngled with oyle, to be a sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord for a sweete sauour: and the drynke offeryng therof shalbe of wine, euen the fourth deale of an hyn.
{23:14} And ye shal eate neither bread nor parched corne, nor greene eares, vntyl ye selfe same day that ye haue brought an offering vnto your God: Let this be a lawe for euer in your generations, and in all your dwellynges.
{23:15} And ye shall count vnto you from the morowe after the Sabboth, euen from the day that ye brought the sheafe of the waue offeryng, seuen Sabbothes they shalbe complet:
{23:16} Euen vnto the morowe after ye seuenth Sabboth shall ye number fiftie dayes, and ye shall bryng a newe meate offeryng vnto the Lorde.
{23:17} And ye shall bryng out of your habitations two waue loaues made of two tenth deales of fine flowre, and that are made with leauen, for first fruites vnto the Lorde.
{23:18} And ye shall bryng with the bread seuen lambes without deformitie, of one yere of age, and one young bullocke, and two rammes, which shall serue for a burnt offeryng vnto the Lorde, with their meate offeringes and their drinke offeringes, to be a sacrifice made by fire for a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde.
{23:19} Then ye shall prepare an hee goate for a sinne offeryng, and two lambes of one yere olde for peace offerynges.
{23:20} And the priest shall waue them with the bread of the first fruites for a waue offering before the Lorde, and with the two lambes: they shalbe holy to the Lorde for the priestes.
{23:21} And ye shall proclayme the same day, that it may be an holy conuocation vnto you: ye shall do no seruile worke therin, let it be a lawe for euer in all your dwellynges throughout your generations.
{23:22} And whe ye reape downe the haruest of your lande, thou shalt not make cleane riddaunce of the corners of thy fielde when thou reapest, neither shalt thou make any after gatheryng of thy haruest, but shalt leaue them vnto the poore and the straunger: I am the Lorde your God.
{23:23} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{23:24} Speake vnto the chyldren of Israel, and say: In the seuenth moneth, in the first day of the moneth shall ye haue Sabbath, euen the remembraunce of blowyng of trumpettes, an holy conuocation.
{23:25} Ye shall do no seruile worke therein, but offer sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lorde.
{23:26} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{23:27} The tenth day also of the selfe seuenth moneth is a day of reconcilyng, therfore shal it be an holy conuocation vnto you, & ye shall humble your soules, and offer sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord.
{23:28} Ye shall do no worke ye same day, for it is a day of recociling, to make an attonement for you before the Lord your God.
{23:29} For whatsoeuer soule it be that humbleth not hym selfe that day, he shalbe cut of from among his people.
{23:30} And whatsoeuer soule do any worke that day, the same soule wyll I destroy from among his people.
{23:31} Ye shall do no maner worke therfore: let it be a lawe for euer in your generations, and in all your dwellynges.
{23:32} Let it be vnto you a Sabbath of rest, and ye shall humble your soules in the ninth day of the moneth at euen: from euen to euen shall ye celebrate your Sabbath.
{23:33} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{23:34} Speake vnto the chyldren of Israel, & say: The fifteenth day of the same seuenth moneth is the feast of tabernacles seuen dayes vnto the Lorde.
{23:35} The first day is an holy conuocation: ye shall do no seruile worke.
{23:36} Seuen dayes ye shall offer sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lorde, and in the eyght day shalbe an holy conuocation vnto you, and ye shall offer sacrifices made by fire vnto the Lorde: It is the solempne assemblie, and ye shall do no seruile worke therin.
{23:37} These are the feastes of the Lorde which ye shall call holy conuocations, for to offer sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lorde, burnt offeryng, meate offeryng, sacrifices, and drynke offerynges, euery thyng vpon his day:
{23:38} Besyde the Sabbathes of the Lorde, and besyde your giftes, besyde all your vowes, and all your free offerynges which ye geue vnto the Lorde.
{23:39} Moreouer, in the fifteenth day of the seuenth moneth when ye haue gathered in the fruite of the lande, ye shall kepe holy day vnto the Lorde seuen dayes: The first day shalbe a Sabbath, lykewise in the eyght day shalbe a Sabbath.
{23:40} And ye shall take you in the first day the fruites of goodly trees, braunches of palme trees, and the bowes of thicke trees, and willowes of the brooke, and shall reioyce before the Lord your God seuen dayes.
{23:41} And ye shall kepe this feast vnto the Lorde seuen dayes in the yere: It shalbe a lawe for euer in your generations, that ye kepe it in the seuenth moneth.
{23:42} Ye shal dwell in boothes seuen dayes: euen all that are Israelites borne shall dwell in boothes:
{23:43} That your children after you may knowe howe that I made the children of Israel to dwell in boothes when I brought them out of the lande of Egipt: I am the Lorde your God.
{23:44} And Moyses declared vnto the children of Israel the feastes of the Lorde.
{24:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{24:2} Commaunde the children of Israel that they bryng vnto thee pure oyle oliue beaten for the lyght, to cause the lampes to burne continually,
{24:3} Without the vayle of witnesse in the tabernacle of the congregation shall Aaron dresse them both euenyng and mornyng before the Lorde alwayes: Let it be a lawe for euer in your generations.
{24:4} He shall dresse the lampes vpon ye pure candlesticke before ye Lord perpetually.
{24:5} And thou shalt take fine floure, and bake twelue cakes therof, two tenth deales shalbe in one cake.
{24:6} And thou shalt set the in two rowes, sixe on a rowe, vpon the pure table before the Lorde.
{24:7} And put pure frankensence vpon the rowes, that they may be bread of remembraunce, and an offeryng made by fire vnto the Lorde.
{24:8} Euery Sabbath he shall put them in rowes before the Lorde euermore, of the chyldren of Israel shall they be offered for an euerlastyng couenaunt.
{24:9} And they shalbe Aarons and his sonnes, which shall eate them in the holy place: For they are most holy vnto hym of the offerynges of the Lorde made by fire, by a perpetuall statute.
{24:10} And the sonne of an Israelitishe wife, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: And this sonne of the Israelitishe wyfe and a man of Israel stroue together in the hoast.
{24:11} And the Israelitishe womans sonne blasphemed the name of the Lorde, and cursed, and they brought hym vnto Moyses: His mothers name was Selomith, which was the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
{24:12} And they put hym in warde, that the minde of ye Lorde might be shewed the.
{24:13} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{24:14} Bryng the cursed speaker without the hoast, and let all that hearde hym, put their handes vpon his head, and let all the multitude stone hym.
{24:15} And thou shalt speake vnto ye children of Israel, saying: Whosoeuer curseth his God, shall beare his sinne.
{24:16} And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lorde, let him be slayne, and all the multitude shall stone hym to death: Whether he be borne in the lande, or a straunger, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lorde, let hym be slayne.
{24:17} And he that kylleth any man, let hym dye the death.
{24:18} And he that kylleth a beast, let hym make hym good, beast for beast.
{24:19} And yf a man cause a blemishe in his neighbour: as he hath done, so shall it be done to hym.
{24:20} Broke for broke, eye for eye, and tooth for tooth: euen as he hath blemisshed a man, so shall he be blemisshed agayne.
{24:21} And he that kylleth a beast, let hym restore it: and he that kylleth a man, let hym dye.
{24:22} Ye shall haue one maner of lawe, euen for the straunger as well as for one of your owne countrey: for I am the Lorde your God.
{24:23} And Moyses tolde the childre of Israel, & they brought hym that had cursed out of the hoast, and stoned hym with stones: And the children of Israel dyd as the Lorde commaunded Moyses.
{25:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses in mout Sinai, saying:
{25:2} Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them: When ye be come into ye lande which I geue you, the lande shall rest and kepe Sabbath vnto the Lorde.
{25:3} Sixe yeres thou shalt sowe thy fielde, and sixe yeres thou shalt cut thy vineyarde, and gather in the fruite therof.
{25:4} But the seuenth yere shalbe a Sabbath of rest vnto the lande, the Lordes Sabbath it shalbe: thou shalt neither sowe thy fielde, nor cut thy vineyarde.
{25:5} That which groweth of the owne accorde of thy haruest, thou shalt not reape, neither gather the grapes that thou hast left behynde: for it is a yere of rest vnto the lande.
{25:6} And the rest of the lande shalbe meate for you, euen for thee, for thy seruaunt, & for thy mayde, for thy hired seruaunt, and for the straunger that soiourneth with thee:
{25:7} And for thy cattell, and for the beastes that are in thy lande, shall all the encrease therof be meate.
{25:8} And thou shalt number seuen Sabbathes of yeres vnto thee, euen seuen tymes seuen yere, and the space of the seuen Sabbathes of yeres wylbe vnto thee nine and fourtie yeres.
{25:9} And then thou shalt cause to blowe the trumpet of the Iubilee in the tenth day of the seuenth moneth, euen in ye day of attonement shal ye make the trumpe blowe throughout all your lande.
{25:10} And ye shall halowe that yere, euen the fiftieth yere, and proclayme libertie throughout all the lande vnto all the inhabiters thereof: for it shalbe a Iubilee vnto you, and ye shall returne euery man vnto his possession, and euery man vnto his kinred agayne.
{25:11} A yere of Iubilee shal that fiftieth yere be vnto you: Ye shall not sowe, neither reape that which groweth of it selfe, neither gather the grapes that are left:
{25:12} For that yere of Iubilee shalbe holy vnto you: but ye shall eate of the encrease therof out of the fielde.
{25:13} In the yere of this Iubilee ye shall returne euery man vnto his possession agayne.
{25:14} If thou sellest ought vnto thy neyghbour, or byest ought of thy neyghbours hande, ye shal not oppresse one another.
{25:15} But according to the number of yeres after the Iubilee yere thou shalt bye of thy neighbour: and accordyng vnto the number of yeres of the fruites he shall sell vnto thee.
{25:16} According vnto the multitude of yeres he shall encrease the price therof, and according to the fewnesse of yeres, he shal minishe the price of it: for the number of fruites doth he sell vnto thee.
{25:17} Oppresse not ye therfore euery man his neighbour, but thou shalt feare thy God: For I am the Lorde your God.
{25:18} Wherfore ye shall do after myne ordinaunces, and kepe my lawes, and do them, and ye shall dwell in the lande in safetie.
{25:19} And the lande shall geue her fruite, and ye shall eate your fyll, and dwell therin in safetie.
{25:20} And yf ye shall say, what shall we eate the seuenth yere? for we shall not sowe, nor gather in our increase:
{25:21} I wyll sende my blessyng vpon you in the sixt yere, and it shall bryng foorth fruite for three yeres.
{25:22} And ye shall sowe the eyght yere, and eate yet of olde fruite vntyll the ninth yere: euen vntill her fruites come ye shall eate of olde store.
{25:23} The lande shall not be solde to waste: for the lande is myne, & ye be but staungers and soiourners with me.
{25:24} In all the lande of your possession, ye shal graunt a redemption for ye lande.
{25:25} If thy brother be waxed poore, and hath solde away of his possession, and yf any of his kinne come to redeeme it, let hym bye out that which his brother solde.
{25:26} And yf he haue no man to redeeme it, and his hande hath gotten and founde as much as may be sufficient to bye it out agayne:
{25:27} The let hym count howe long it hath ben solde, and delyuer the rest vnto the man to whom he solde it, that he may returne to his possession agayne.
{25:28} But and yf his hande can not get sufficient to restore to the other agayne, the that which is solde shal remayne in the hande of hym that hath bought it, vntyll the yere of Iubilee: and in the Iubilee it shall come out, and he shall returne vnto his possession agayne.
{25:29} And yf a man sell a dwellyng house in a walled citie, he may bye it out agayne within a whole yere after it is solde: within a yere may he redeeme it.
{25:30} But and yf he bye it not out agayne within the space of a full yere, then the house that is in the walled citie, shalbe stablished, as translated to hym that bought it and his successours after hym, & shall not go out in the Iubilee.
{25:31} But the houses of vyllages, which haue no walles rounde about them, are counted as the fielde of the coutrey: and therefore they may be bought out agayne, and shal go out in the Iubilee.
{25:32} Notwithstandyng, the cities of the Leuites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Leuites redeeme at all seasons.
{25:33} And yf a man purchase of the Leuites, the house that was solde, and the citie of their possession, shall go out in the yere of Iubilee: for the houses of the cities of the Leuites, are their possession among the children of Israel.
{25:34} But the fielde of the suburbes of their cities may not be solde: for it is their perpetuall possession.
{25:35} If thy brother be waxen poore and fallen in decay with thee, thou shalt relieue hym as a straunger or soiourner, that he may lyue with thee.
{25:36} And thou shalt take none vsurie of hym, or vantage: but thou shalt feare thy God, that thy brother may lyue with thee.
{25:37} Thou shalt not geue hym thy money vpon vsurie, nor lende him thy victuels for encrease.
{25:38} I am the Lorde your God, which brought you out of the lande of Egypt, to geue you the lande of Chanaan, and to be your God.
{25:39} If thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poore, and be solde vnto thee, thou shalt not compell hym to serue as a bonde seruaunt:
{25:40} But as an hired seruaunt, and as a soiourner he shalbe with thee, and shall serue thee vnto the yere of Iubilee.
{25:41} And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with hym, and shall returne vnto his owne kinred agayne, and vnto the possession of his fathers shall he returne.
{25:42} For they are my seruauntes, which I brought out of the lande of Egypt, and shall not therfore be solde as bondmen.
{25:43} Thou shalt not rule ouer hym cruelly, but shalt feare thy God.
{25:44} Thy bondseruaunt and thy bondemayde which thou shalt haue, shalbe of the heathen that are rounde about you: of them shall ye purchase seruauntes and maydes.
{25:45} Moreouer, of the children of ye straungers that are soiourners among you, of them shall ye bye, & of their families that are with you, which they begat in your lande: these shalbe your possession.
{25:46} And ye shall take them as inheritauce for your children after yon, to possesse them for an inheritaunce, they shalbe your bondmen for euer: but ouer your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one ouer another cruelly.
{25:47} If a soiourner or straunger waxe riche by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by hym waxe poore, and sell hym selfe vnto the straunger or soiourner by thee, or to the stocke of the straungers kinne:
{25:48} After that he is solde, he may be redeemed agayne: one of his brethren may redeeme hym:
{25:49} Either his vncle, or his vncles sonne may bye hym out: or any that is nye of kinne vnto hym of his kinred, may redeeme hym: either yf his hande can get so much, he may be bought out.
{25:50} And he shall recken with hym that bought hym, from the yere that he was solde in, vnto the yere of Iubilee: and the price of his beyng, shalbe accordyng vnto the number of yeres, according to the tyme of an hired seruaunt shall he be with hym.
{25:51} If there be yet many yeres behynde, accordyng vnto them let hym geue againe for his deliueraunce, of the money that he was bought for.
{25:52} If there remayne but fewe yeres vnto the yere of Iubilee, let hym count with hym agayne: and accordyng vnto his yeres, geue hym agayne for his redemption.
{25:53} And he shalbe with hym yere by yere as an hired seruaunt: and the other shal not raigne cruelly ouer him in thy sight.
{25:54} If he be not redeemed thus, he shall go out in the yere of Iubilee, both he and his children with hym:
{25:55} For vnto me the children of Israel are seruauntes, they are my seruauntes which I brought out of the lande of Egypt: I am the Lorde your God.
{26:1} Ye shall make you no idols nor graue image, neither reare you vp any piller, neither shall ye set vp any image of stone in your lande to bowe downe vnto it: for I am the Lorde your God.
{26:2} Ye shall kepe my Sabbathes, and reuerence my sanctuarie: for I am the Lorde.
{26:3} If ye walke in my ordinaunces, and kepe my commaundementes, & do the:
{26:4} I wyll sende you rayne in due season, and the lande shall yeelde her increase, and the trees of the fielde shall geue their fruite:
{26:5} And your thresshyng shal reache vnto the vintage, & the vintage shall reache vnto sowyng tyme: and ye shall eate your bread in plenteousnesse, and dwell in your lande safely.
{26:6} And I wyll sende peace in the lande, and ye shall lye downe without any man to make you afrayde: And I wyll ridde euyll beastes out of the lande, and there shall no sworde go throughout your lande.
{26:7} And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shal fall before you vpon ye sworde.
{26:8} And fiue of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousande to flight: & your enemies shall fall before you vpon the sworde.
{26:9} For I wyll haue respect vnto you, and make you increase, and multiplie you, and set vp my couenaunt with you.
{26:10} And ye shall eate olde store, and cary out olde, because of the newe.
{26:11} And I wyll make my dwellyng place among you, and my soule shal not lothe you.
{26:12} I wyll walke among you, and wilbe your God, and ye shalbe my people.
{26:13} I am the Lorde your God which brought you out of the lande of Egypt, that ye shoulde not be their bondmen, and I haue broken the chaynes of your yoke, and made you go vpright.
{26:14} But and if ye wyll not hearken vnto me, nor wyll not do after these commaundementes:
{26:15} And yf ye shall dispise myne ordinaunces, either if your soule abhorre my lawes, so that ye wyll not do all my commaundementes, but breake my couenaunt,
{26:16} I also wyll do this vnto you: For I wyll bryng vpon you fearefulnesse, consumption, and the burnyng ague to consume your eyes, and gender sorowe of heart: And ye shall sowe your seede in vayne, for your enemies shall eate it.
{26:17} And I wyll set my face agaynst you, & ye shall fall before your enemies: they that hate you shal raigne ouer you, and ye shall flee whe no man foloweth you.
{26:18} And yf ye wyl not yet for all this hearken vnto me, then wyll I punishe you seuen tymes more for your sinnes:
{26:19} And wyll breake the pride of your power, and I wyll make your heauen as iron, and your earth as brasse.
{26:20} And your labour shalbe spent in vayne: for your lande shall not geue her increase, neither shall the trees of the lande geue their fruites.
{26:21} And if ye walke contrarie vnto me, and wyll not hearken vnto me, I wyll bryng seuen tymes mo plagues vpon you, accordyng to your sinnes.
{26:22} I wyll also sende in wylde beastes vpon you, which shall robbe you of your children, and destroy your cattell, and make you fewe in number, and cause your hye wayes to be desolate.
{26:23} And if ye may not be refourmed by these thynges, but shall walke contrary vnto me:
{26:24} Then wyll I also walke contrarie vnto you, and wyl punishe you yet seuen tymes for your sinnes.
{26:25} And I wyll sende a sworde vpon you, that shall auenge my couenaunt: And when ye are gathered together within your cities, I wyll sende the pestilence among you, and ye shalbe delyuered into the hande of the enemie.
{26:26} And whe I haue broken the staffe of your bread ten wyues shall bake your bread in one ouen, and they shall deliuer you your bread agayne by wayght, ye shall eate, and not be satisfied.
{26:27} And if ye wyl not yet for all this hearken vnto me, but walke agaynst me:
{26:28} I wyll walke contrary vnto you also in indignation, and wyll chastise you seuen tymes more for your sinnes.
{26:29} And ye shall eate the fleshe of your sonnes, and the fleshe of your daughters shall ye deuour.
{26:30} I wyll destroy your hye places, and cut away your images, and cast your carkasses vpon ye bodyes of your idols, and my soule shall abhorre you.
{26:31} And I wyll make your cities desolate, and bring your sanctuarie vnto naught, and wyll not smell the sauour of your sweete odours.
{26:32} I wyll bryng the lande vnto a wildernesse, and your enemies which dwell therin shall wonder at it.
{26:33} And I wyll strowe you among the heathen, and wyll drawe out a sworde after you: and your lande shalbe waste, and your cities desolate.
{26:34} Then shall the lande enioy her Sabbathes as long as it lyeth voyde, and ye shalbe in your enemies lande: euen then shall the lande rest and enioy her Sabbathes.
{26:35} As long as it lyeth voyde, it shall rest: because it dyd not rest in your Sabbathes when ye dwelt vpon it.
{26:36} And vpon them that are left alyue of you, I will sende a fayntnesse into their heartes in the landes of their enemies: and the sounde of a shakyng leafe shall chase them, and they shall flee as fleyng from a sworde: they shall fall, no man folowyng vpon them.
{26:37} They shall fall one vpon another as it were before a sworde, euen no man folowyng vpon them, and ye shall haue no power to stand before your enemies.
{26:38} And ye shall perishe among the heathen, and the lande of your enemies shall eate you vp.
{26:39} And they that are left of you, shal pine away in their vnrighteousnesse euen in your enemies landes, & in the misdeedes of their fathers shall they consume with them.
{26:40} And they shal confesse their misdeedes and the misdeedes of their fathers, for their trespasse which they haue trespassed agaynst me, and for that also that they haue walked contrary vnto me.
{26:41} Therfore, I also wyll walke contrarie vnto them, and wyl bring them into the lande of their enemies: And then at the least way their vncircumcised heartes shalbe tamed, and they shall willingly accept their sinne.
{26:42} Then I wyll remember my couenaunt with Iacob, and my couenaunt with Isahac, and my couenaunt with Abraham wyll I remember, and wyll thynke on the lande.
{26:43} The lande also shalbe left of them, and shall enioy her Sabbathes whyle she lyeth waste without them: And they shall willingly accept their sinne, because they dispised my lawes, & because their soule abhorred my ordinaunces.
{26:44} And yet for all that, when they be in the lande of their enemies, I wyll not cast them away, neither wyll abhorre them to destroy them vtterly, and to breake my couenaunt with them: for I am the Lorde their God.
{26:45} I wyll for their sakes remember the couenaunt of olde, when I brought the out of the lande of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I myght be their God: I am the Lorde.
{26:46} These are the ordinaunces, and iudgementes, and lawes, which the Lorde made betweene hym and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hande of Moyses.
{27:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{27:2} Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them: If any man wyl make a singuler vowe of a person vnto the Lorde, by thy estimation,
{27:3} Then thy estimation shalbe thus: Of the male from twentie yeres olde vnto sixtie, shalbe by thy estimation fiftie sicles of siluer, after the sicle of the sanctuarie:
{27:4} And if it be a female, then thy valuation shalbe thirtie sicles.
{27:5} And from fiue yeres to twentie, thy valuation shalbe of the male twentie sicles, and of the female ten sicles.
{27:6} And from a moneth vnto fiue yeres, thy estimation shalbe of the male at fiue sicles of siluer, and the female at three sicles of siluer.
{27:7} And from sixtie yeres olde and aboue, if he be a male, then thy price shalbe fifteene sicles, and for the female ten sicles.
{27:8} But if he be poorer then thou hast esteemed hym, he shall present hym selfe before the priest, and the priest shall value hym: accordyng as the hande of hym that vowed is able to get, euen so shall the priest value hym.
{27:9} If it be a beast of which men bryng an offeryng vnto the Lorde, all that any man geueth of such vnto the Lord, shalbe holy.
{27:10} He shall not alter it, nor chaunge it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: And if he chaunge beast for beast, then both the same beast and it also wherwith it was chaunged, shalbe holy.
{27:11} If it be any maner of vncleane beast, of which men do not offer a sacrifice vnto the Lorde, he shall set the beast before the priest:
{27:12} And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: and as the priest setteth it, so shall it be.
{27:13} But if he wyll bye it agayne, he shall geue the fift part more aboue that it was set at.
{27:14} If any man dedicate his house to be holy vnto the Lorde, the priest shall set it, whether it be good or bad: and as the priest hath set it, so shall it stande.
{27:15} And when he that sanctified it wyll redeeme his house, let hym geue the fift part of the money that it was iudged at therto, and it shalbe his.
{27:16} If a man halowe a peece of his inherited lande vnto the Lorde, thou shalt value it accordyng to the seede therof: An Homer of barly seede shalbe set at fiftie sicles of siluer.
{27:17} If he halowe his fielde immediatly fro the yere of Iubilee, it shalbe worth accordyng as thou doest esteeme it.
{27:18} But and if he halowe his fielde after the Iubilee, the priest shall recken vnto hym the money, accordyng to the number of the yeres that remayne, vnto the yeres of Iublilee folowyng, and it shalbe abated by thy estimation.
{27:19} If he that consecrated the fielde wyll redeeme it agayne, let hym put the fift part of the price that thou didst value it at therunto, and it shalbe his.
{27:20} And if he wyll not redeeme the fielde, but selleth the fielde to another man: he that vowed may redeeme it no more.
{27:21} But when the fielde goeth out in the yere of Iubilee, and it shalbe holy vnto the Lord, euen as a fielde seperate from common vses, and it shalbe the priestes possession.
{27:22} If a man sanctifie vnto the Lorde a fielde which he hath bought, and is not of the grounde of his inheritaunce:
{27:23} The priest shal recken vnto him what it is worth vnto the yere of Iubilee, and he shall geue the price that it is set at the same day, as a thyng consecrate vnto the Lorde.
{27:24} And in the yere of Iubilee, the fielde shall returne vnto him of whom it was bought, to hym whose inheritaunce of lande it was.
{27:25} And all thy valuation shalbe according to the sicle of the sanctuarie: One sicle contayneth twentie gerahs.
{27:26} But the first borne of the beastes that is the Lordes first borne, may no man sanctifie, whether it be oxe or sheepe, for it is the Lordes alredie.
{27:27} If it be an vncleane beast, he shall redeeme it as thou shalt set it at, and geue the fift part more therto: Or if it be not redeemed, it shalbe solde accordyng to thy estimation.
{27:28} Notwithstandyng, nothyng seperate from the common vse that a man doth seperate vnto the Lorde of all that he hath, whether it be man or beast, or lande of his inheritaunce, may be solde or redeemed: for euery thyng seperate from the common vse, is most holy vnto the Lorde.
{27:29} Nothing seperate from the common vse, whiche shalbe seperate from man, shalbe redeemed, but dye the death.
{27:30} Euery tithe of the lande also, both of the seede of the lande, and of the fruite of the trees, is the Lordes, and is sanctified vnto the Lorde.
{27:31} And if a man wyll redeeme ought of his tithes, let hym adde the fift part thereto.
