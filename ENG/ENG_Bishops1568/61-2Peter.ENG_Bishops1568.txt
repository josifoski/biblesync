{1:1} Simon Peter, a seruaunt and an Apostle of Iesus Christe, to them which haue obteined lyke precious faith with vs, thorowe the ryghteousnes of our god and sauiour Iesus Christe:
{1:2} Grace and peace be multiplied vnto you, through the knowledge of God, and of Iesus our Lorde:
{1:3} Accordyng as his godly power hath geuen vnto vs all thynges that parteine vnto lyfe and godlynesse, through the knowledge of hym that hath called vs vnto glorie and vertue:
{1:4} By the which are geuen vnto vs excellent and most great promises, that by the meanes thereof, ye might be partakers of the godly nature, yf ye flee the corruption of worldly lust.
{1:5} And herevnto geue all diligence: in your fayth minister vertue, in vertue knowledge,
{1:6} In knowledge temperaunce, in temperaunce pacience, in pacience godlynesse,
{1:7} In godlynesse brotherly kyndnesse, in brotherly kyndnesse loue.
{1:8} For yf these thynges be among you, and be plenteous, they wyll make you that ye neither shalbe idle nor vnfruitefull in the knowledge of our Lorde Iesus Christe.
{1:9} But he that lacketh these thynges, is blynde, and can not see farre of, & hath forgotten that he was purged from his olde sinnes.
{1:10} Wherfore brethren, geue the more diligence for to make your callyng and election sure: For yf ye do such thynges, ye shall neuer fall.
{1:11} Yea, and by this meanes an entryng in shalbe ministred vnto you aboudantlye, into the euerlastyng kyngdome of our Lorde and sauiour Iesus Christe.
{1:12} Wherfore I wyll not be negligent to put you alwayes in remembraunce of suche thynges, though ye knowe them your selues, and be stablysshed in the present trueth.
{1:13} Notwithstandyng I thynke it meete, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stirre you vp by puttyng you in remembraunce:
{1:14} Forasmuch as I am sure that shortly I must put of this my tabernacle, euen as our Lorde Iesus Christe shewed me.
{1:15} I wyll euer also geue my diligence yt ye may haue wherwith to stirre vp the remembraunce of these thynges after my departyng.
{1:16} For we haue not folowed deceitfull fables, when we opened vnto you the power and commyng of our Lorde Iesus Christe, but with our eyes we sawe his maiestie:
{1:17} Euen then veryly when he receaued of God the father honour and glorie, & when there came suche a voyce to hym from the excellent glorie: This is my deare beloued sonne in whom I delyte.
{1:18} This voyce we heard come from heauen, when we were with him in the holye mount.
{1:19} We haue also a ryght sure worde of prophesie, wherevnto yf ye take heede, as vnto a lyght that shyneth in a darke place, ye do well, vntyll the day dawne, and the day starre arise in your heartes.
{1:20} So that ye first knowe this, that no prophesie in the scripture is of any priuate motion.
{1:21} For the prophesie came not in olde time by the wyll of man: but holy men of God, spake as they were moued by the holy ghost.
{2:1} There were false prophetes also among the people, eue as there shalbe false teachers among you, whiche pryuyly shal bryng in damnable heresies, euen denying the Lorde that hath bought them, and bryng vpo them selues swyft damnation.
{2:2} And many shall folowe their damnable wayes, by whom the way of trueth shalbe euyll spoken of:
{2:3} And through couetousnesse, shall they with fayned wordes make marchaudize of you, whose iudgement is nowe not farre of, and their damnation sleepeth not.
{2:4} For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them downe into hell, and delyuered them into chaynes of darknesse, to be kept vnto iudgement:
{2:5} Neither spared the olde worlde, but saued Noe the eyght person a preacher of ryghteousnesse, and brought in the flood vpon the worlde of the vngodly,
{2:6} And turned their cities of Sodome & Gomorrhe into asshes, ouerthrewe the, dampned them, and made of them an ensample vnto those that after shoulde lyue vngodly:
{2:7} And iust Lot, vexed with ye vncleane conuersatio of the wicked, deliuered he.
{2:8} For he beyng ryghteous, & dwellyng among them, in seyng and hearyng, vexed his ryghteous soule from daye to daye with their vnlawfull deedes.
{2:9} The Lorde knoweth howe to delyuer the godly out of temptation, and to reserue the vniust vnto the day of iudgement for to be punished:
{2:10} But chiefely them that walke after the fleshe in the lust of vncleanenesse, and despise auctoritie. Presumptious are they, and stande in their owne conceyte, whiche feare not to speake euyl of them that excell in worship.
{2:11} When the Angels whiche are greater both in power and might, geue not raylyng iudgement against them before the Lorde.
{2:12} But these, as bruite beastes ledde with sensualitie, and made to be taken and destroyed, speake euyll of the thynges that they vnderstande not, and shall perishe through their owne corruption,
{2:13} And receaue the rewarde of vnryghteousnesse, they count it pleasure to lyue deliciouslye for a season: Spottes they are and blottes, delighting them selues in their deceauynges, in feastyng with you.
{2:14} Hauyng eyes full of adulterie, & that can not ceasse from sinne, begylyng vnstable soules: Heartes they haue exercised with robberie, they are cursed chyldren,
{2:15} Which haue forsaken the ryght waye, and are gone astray, folowyng the way of Balaam the sonne of Bosor, which loued the rewarde of vnrighteousnesse:
{2:16} But was rebuked of his iniquitie. The dumbe beast, and vsed to the yoke, speaking with mans voyce, forbad the madnesse of the prophete.
{2:17} These are welles without water, cloudes that are caryed with a tempest, to whom the mist of darknesse is reserued for euer.
{2:18} For when they haue spoken the great swellyng wordes of vanitie, they entice through lustes in the voluptuousnesse of the fleshe, them that were cleane escaped, from them whiche are wrapped in errour,
{2:19} Whyle they promise them libertie, where as they them selues are ye bonde seruauntes of corruption. For of whom a man is ouercome, vnto the same is he brought in bondage.
{2:20} For yf they, after they haue escaped from the fylthynesse of the worlde, thorowe the knowledge of the Lord, & the sauiour Iesus Christe, are yet tangled agayne therein, and ouercome, then is the later end worse with them then the begynnyng.
{2:21} For it had ben better for them not to haue knowen the way of righteousnes, then after they haue knowen it, to turne from the holy commaundement that was geuen vnto them.
{2:22} But the same is happened vnto them that is vsed to be spoken by the true prouerbe: The dogge is tourned to his owne vomite againe, and the sowe that was wasshed, is turned againe to her wallowyng in the myre.
{3:1} This is the seconde epistle that I now wryte vnto you, dearely beloued, wherwith I stirre vp & warne your pure myndes,
{3:2} By puttyng you in remembraunce, that ye may be myndfull of the wordes which were tolde before of the holy prophetes, and also the commaundement of vs, whiche be Apostles of the Lorde and sauiour.
{3:3} This first vnderstande, that there shall come in the laste dayes mockers, whiche wyll walke after their owne lustes,
{3:4} And say: Where is the promise of his commyng? For sence the fathers dyed, all thynges continue a lyke from the begynnyng of the creation.
{3:5} For this they knowe not (and that wylfully) howe that the heauens were of olde, and the earth that was of the water, and by the water, by the worde of God:
{3:6} By the which thinges the world that then was, perisshed, beyng then ouerrunne with water.
{3:7} But the heauens and earth whiche are nowe, be kept by his worde in store, and reserued vnto fire, agaynst the day of iudgement and perdition of vngodly men.
{3:8} Dearely beloued, be not ignoraunt of this one thyng, howe that one day is with the Lorde as a thousande yere, & a thousande yere as one day.
{3:9} The Lorde that hath promised, is not slacke, as some men count slacknesse, but is pacient to vswarde forasmuch as he woulde haue no man lost, but wyll receaue all men to repentaunce.
{3:10} Neuerthelesse the day of the Lorde wyll come as a theefe in the nyght, in the which the heauens shal passe away with a noyse, and the elementes shall melt with heate, the earth also and the workes that are therein shall burne.
{3:11} Seyng then that all these thynges shall perisshe, what maner persons ought ye to be in holy conuersation and godlynesse:
{3:12} Lokyng for, and hastyng vnto the comyng of the day of God, by whom the heauens shall perishe with fire, and the elementes shall melt with heate?
{3:13} Neuerthelesse, we accordyng to his promise, loke for a newe heauen, and a newe earth, wherein dwelleth ryghteousnesse.
{3:14} Wherfore dearely beloued, seyng that ye loke for such thynges, be diligent that ye may be founde of hym in peace, without spot, and vndefyled:
{3:15} And suppose that the long suffering of the Lord is saluatio, euen as our dearely beloued brother Paul also, accordyng to the wisedome geuen vnto hym, hath written vnto you:
{3:16} Yea almost in euery epistle, speakyng of such thinges: among which, are manye thynges harde to be vnderstande, which they that are vnlearned and vnstable, peruert, as they do also the other scriptures, vnto their owne destruction.
{3:17} Ye therfore beloued, seyng ye be warned afore hande, beware lest ye with other men be also plucked away through the errour of the wicked, and fall from your owne stedfastnesse:
{3:18} But growe in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lorde and sauiour Iesus Christe, to whom be glorie both nowe and for euer. Amen.
