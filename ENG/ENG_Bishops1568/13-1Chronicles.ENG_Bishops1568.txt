{11:3} Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron, and Dauid made a couenaunt with them in Hebro before the Lorde: And they annoynted Dauid king ouer Israel according to the worde of the Lorde, by the hande of Samuel.

{11:6} And Dauid sayde: Whosoeuer smyteth the Iebusites first, shalbe the principall captayne, and a lorde. So Ioab the sonne of Zaruia went first vp, and was made the chiefe captayne.
{11:7} And Dauid dwelt in the castell Sion and therefore they called it the citie of Dauid.
{11:8} And he built the citie on euery syde, euen from Millo round about: and Ioab repaired the rest of the citie.

{11:11} And this is the number of the mightie men whom Dauid had: Iosobeam the sonne of Hachmoni the chiefe among thirtie: he lift vp his speare against three hundred, and wounded them at one tyme.
{11:12} After him was Eleazar his vncles sonne an Ahothite, which was one of the three mightiest:
{11:13} He was with Dauid at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battaile: And there was there a parcell of grounde full of barly, and the people fled before the Philistines.
{11:14} And they stept foorth into the middest of the fielde, and saued it, and slue the Philistines, and the Lorde gaue a great victorie.

{11:18} And the three brake through the hoast of the Philistines, and drewe water out of the wel that was by ye gate at Bethlehem, and toke it and brought it to Dauid: Neuerthelesse, Dauid woulde not drinke of it, but rather offered it to the Lorde,
{11:19} And sayd: my God forbyd it me that I shoulde do this thing: Shall I drinke the blood of these men, that haue put their liues in ieoperdie? for with the ieoperdie of their liues they brought it: therefore he would not drinke it. And this did these three mightiest.
{11:20} And Abisai the brother of Ioab, he also was captayne among three: For he lyft vp his speare against three hundred, and wounded them, and had a name among the three:
{11:21} Yea among three, he was more honorable then the two, for he was their captayne: Howbeit, he attayned not to the first three.
{11:22} Banaia ye sonne of Iehoiada, the sonne of a very strong man, which had done many actes, of Cabzeel: he slue two strong lions of Moab, & went downe and slue a lion in a pit in time of snowe.
{11:23} And he slue an Egyptian, whose stature was euen fiue cubites long, and in the Egyptians hand was a speare lyke a weauers beame: And the other went downe to him with a waster, & plucked the speare out of the Egyptians hand, and slue him with his owne speare.
{11:24} Such thinges did Banaia the sonne of Iehoiada, and had the name among the three mightiest,
{11:25} And was honorable among thirtie: but attayned not vnto the first three: And Dauid made him of his counsaile.

{11:47} Eliel and Obed, and Iasiel a Mesobaite.
{12:1} These are they that came to Dauid to Ziklag while he yet kept himselfe close because of Saul the sonne of Cis: and they were very strong helpers in battaile.
{12:2} They were weaponed with bowes, and could hurle stones with the right hand and with the left, and shoote arrowes out of a bowe, & were of Sauls brethren, euen of Beniamin.
{12:3} The chiefest were Ahiezer, and Ioas the sonnes of Simaa a Gibeonite, and Ieziel and Pelet the sonnes of Asmaueth, Beracah and Iehu of Anathoth.
{12:4} And Ismaia a Gibeonite, a mightie man among thirtie, and more then the thirtie: Ieremiah, Iehaziel, Iehonan, and Iosabad of Gedor.

{12:14} These were of the sonnes of Gad, and were captaines ouer the men of warre: one of the least coulde resist an hundred, and the greatest a thousand.
{12:15} These are they that went ouer Iordane in the first moneth when he had filled ouer all his banckes, and they put to flight all them of the valley both toward the east and west.
{12:16} And there came of the children of Beniamin & Iuda to the houlde vnto Dauid.
{12:17} And Dauid went out to meete them, and aunswered, and sayd vnto them: If ye be come peaceably vnto me, to helpe me, myne heart shalbe knit vnto you: but and if you come to betraye me to myne aduersaries, seeing there is no wickednes in myne handes, the God of our fathers loke thereon and rebuke it.
{12:18} And the spirite came vpon Amasai, which was the chiefe among thirtie, & saide: Thyne are we Dauid, and on thy side thou sonne of Isai: Peace, peace be vnto thee, & peace be to thy helpers, for thy God is thyne helpe. Then Dauid receaued them, & made them heades of companies of the men of warre.
{12:19} And there fell some of Manasse to Dauid, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battaile, but they helped them not: For the lordes of the Philistines toke aduisement, and sent him away againe, saying: he will fall to his maister Saul to the ieoperdie of our heades.
{12:20} As he went to Ziklag, there fel to him of Manasse Adna, Iozadad, Iediel, Michael, Iozabad, Elihu, and Zilthai, heades of the thousandes that were of Manasse.
{12:21} And they holpe Dauid against the rouers: For they were all mightie men of warre, and captaynes in the hoast.
{12:22} For at that tyme there came one or other to Dauid day by day to helpe him, vntil it was a great hoast, like the hoast of God.
{12:23} And this is the number of the chiefe captaynes that were prepared to battaile, and came to Dauid to Hebron, to turne the kingdome of Saul to him, according to the word of the Lorde.
{12:24} The children of Iuda that bare shield and speare, were sixe thousand & eight hundred, redie prepared to the warre.
{12:25} Of the children of Simeon, men of might to warre 7 M. & one hundred.
{12:26} Of the children of Leui, foure thousand and sixe hundred.
{12:27} And Iehoiada was the chiefe of them of Aaron, and with him three thousand and seuen hundred.
{12:28} And Zadoc a young man, strong and valiaunt, and of his fathers housholde, twentie and two captaines.
{12:29} And of the children of Beniamin the brothren of Saul, three thousand: And a great part of them did vnto that tyme folowe the house of Saul.
{12:30} And of the children of Ephraim, twentie thousand and eight hundred, mightie men of warre, and famous men in the houshoulde of their fathers.
{12:31} And of the halfe tribe of Manasse, eyghteene thousand, which were appointed by name to come and make Dauid king.
{12:32} And of the children of Isachar, which were men that had vnderstanding of the tymes, to knowe what Israel ought to do, the heads of them were two hundred: & all their brethren were at their wyll.
{12:33} And of Zabulon which went out to battaile, expert in warre and in all instrumentes of warre, fiftie thousand, which coulde set the battaile in arraye, they were not of double heart.
{12:34} And of Nephthali a thousand captaines, and with them with shielde and speare thirtie and seuen thousand.
{12:35} And of Dan expert in battayle, twentie & eyght thousand and sixe hundred.
{12:36} And of Aser that went out to the warre and kept the forefront of the battaile fourtie thousand.
{12:37} And of the othersyde of Iordane, of the Rubenites, and Gadites, and of the halfe tribe of Manasse, with all manner of instrumentes of warre, and hundred and twentie thousand.
{12:38} All these were men of warre, keping the forefront of the battel and with perfecte heart came to Hebron to make Dauid king ouer all Israel: And all the rest of Israel was of one accorde to make Dauid king.
{12:39} And there they were with Dauid three dayes eating & drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.
{12:40} Moreouer, they that were nye them, euen vnto Isachar, Zabulon, & Nephthali, brought bread on asses, cammels, mules, & oxen, & meate, flowre, figges, reasinges, wine, & oyle, oxen, and sheepe aboundantly: For there was ioy in Israel.
{13:1} And Dauid counsailed with the captaynes of thousandes and hundredes, and with al the Lordes,
{13:2} And sayde vnto all the congregation of Israel: If it seeme you good, & to be of the Lord our God, we will send abrode vnto our brethren that are left in all the lande of Israel, and with them also to the priestes and Leuites which are in their suburbes, to gather them together vnto vs:
{13:3} And we will bring againe the arke of our God to vs: for we regarded it not in the dayes of Saul.
{13:4} And all the congregation was content that he should do so: for the thing seemed good in the eyes of all the people.
{13:5} So Dauid gathered all Israel together from Sihor in Egypt, vnto the entering of Hemath, to bring the arke of the Lorde from Kiriathiarim.
{13:6} And Dauid went vp and all Israel to an high place towarde Kiriathiarim, that was in Iuda, to set thence the arke of the Lorde God that dwelleth betweene the Cherubs, where his name is called on.
{13:7} And they carryed the arke of God in a newe carte out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and his brother guided the carte.
{13:8} And Dauid and all Israel played before the arke of God with all their might, with singing, and harpes, psalteries, and tymbrels, and cymbales, and trumpettes.
{13:9} And when they came vnto the thresshing floore of Chidon, Uzza put foorth his hande to holde the arke, for the oxen stumbled.
{13:10} And the Lorde was wroth with Uzza, and smote him, because he put his hand to the arke: and there he dyed before God.
{13:11} And Dauid was out of quiet because the Lorde had rent a rent in Uzza, and he called the name of that place, the renting of Uzza, vnto this day.
{13:12} And Dauid was afrayde of God that day, saying: how shall I bring the arke of God home to me?
{13:13} And so Dauid brought not the arke home to him to the citie of Dauid: but carryed it into the house of Obed Edom a Gethite.
{13:14} And the arke of God remayned with Obed Edom, euen in his house, three monethes: And the Lorde blessed the house of Obed Edom, & all that he had.
{14:1} So Hiram the king of Tyre sent messengers to Dauid, and timber of Cedar trees, with masons and carpeters, to builde him an house.
{14:2} And Dauid perceaued that the Lorde had confirmed him king vpon Israel, & that his kingdome was lift vp on hie because of his people Israel:
{14:3} And Dauid toke yet mo wyues at Hierusalem, and begat mo sonnes and daughters.
{14:4} These are the names of his children, which were borne vnto him at Hierusalem: Samua, Sobab, Nathan, & Solomon,
{14:5} Iibhar, Elisua, and Eliphalet,
{14:6} Noga, Nepheg, and Iaphia,
{14:7} Elisama, Beeliada, and Eliphalet.
{14:8} And when the Philistines heard that Dauid was annoynted king vpon all Israel, all the Philistines went vp to seeke Dauid: And Dauid heard of it, & went out against them.
{14:9} And the Philistines came in, and spread them selues through the valley of Rephaim.
{14:10} And Dauid asked counsaile at God, saying: Shall I go against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliuer them into myne hand?
{14:11} And the Lorde saide vnto him: go vp, for I wil deliuer them into thyne hand. And so they came vp to Baal Perazim, and Dauid smote them there, and Dauid saide: God hath deuided myne enemies with myne hand, as a man would deuide water, and therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
{14:12} And when they had left their gods there, Dauid gaue a commaundement, and they were burnt with fire.
{14:13} And the Philistines came together againe, and russhed into the valley.
{14:14} And Dauid asked againe at God: And God said to him, Go not vp after them, but turne away from them that thou mayest come vpon them ouer against the peretrees.
{14:15} And when thou hearest a sounde go in the toppes of the peretrees, then go out to battaile: for God is gone forth before thee, to smyte the hoast of the Philistines.
{14:16} Dauid therfore did as God commaunded him, and they smote the hoast of the Philistines, from Gibeon to Gazer.
{14:17} And the fame of Dauid went out into all landes, and the Lorde made all nations feare him.
{15:1} And Dauid made him houses in the citie of Dauid, and prepared a place for the arke of God, and pitched for it a tent.
{15:2} Then Dauid saide: The arke of God ought not to be carryed but of the Leuites: For them hath the Lord chosen to beare the arke of the Lorde, and to minister vnto him for euer.
{15:3} And Dauid gathered all Israel together to Hierusalem, to fetch the arke of the Lorde vnto his place which he had ordayned for it.
{15:4} And Dauid brought together the children of Aaron and the Leuites.
{15:5} Of the sonnes of Caath, was Uriel the chiefe, & of his brethren there were an hundred and twentie.
{15:6} Of the children of Merari, Asaia the chiefe, and of his brethren two hundred and twentie.
{15:7} Of the sonnes of Gersom, Ioel the chiefe, and of his brethren an hundred and thirtie.
{15:8} Of the children of Elizaphan, Semaia the chiefe, & of his brethren two hundred.
{15:9} Of the sonnes of Hebron, Eliel the chiefe, and of his brethren fourescore.
{15:10} Of the sonnes of Uzziel, Aminadab the chiefe, and of his brethren an hundred and twelue.
{15:11} And Dauid called Zadoc and Abiathar the priestes: and the Leuites, Uzziel, Asaia, Ioel, Semaia, Eliel, and Aminadab,
{15:12} And saide vnto them: Ye that are the principall fathers of the Leuites, see that ye be holy with your brethren, that ye may bring in the arke of the Lorde God of Israel vnto the place that I haue prepared for it.
{15:13} For, because ye were not there at the first, the Lorde our God made a rent among vs, for that we sought him not as the fassion ought to be.
{15:14} So the priestes and the Leuites sanctified them selues, to fet the arke of the Lorde God of Israel.
{15:15} And the children of the Leuites bare the arke of God vpon their shoulders with staues thereon, as Moyses commaunded according to the worde of the Lorde.
{15:16} And Dauid spake to the chiefe heades of the Leuites, that they should appoynt certaine of their brethren to sing with instrumentes of musicke, psalteries, harpes, and cymbales, that they might make a sounde, and to sing on hie with ioyfulnesse.
{15:17} And the Leuites appoynted Heman the sonne of Ioel, and of his brethren, Asaph the sonne of Berechia, and of the sonnes of Merari and of their brethren, Ethan the sonne of Cusaiahu.
{15:18} And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zacharia, Ben, Iaziel, Semiramoth, Iehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiahu, Maasiah, Mathathiahu, Eliphalehu, Mikniahu, Obed Edom, and Ieiel, porters.
{15:19} So Heman, Asaph, and Ethan the singers, made a sounde with cymbales of brasse.
{15:20} And Zacharia, Aziel, Semiramoth, Iehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maasiahu, and Banaiahu, played with psalteries on an Alamoth.
{15:21} Mathathiahu, Eliphalehu, Mikniahu, Obed Edom, Ieiel, and Azaiahu, played vpon harpes an eyght aboue, with courage.
{15:22} And Chenaniahu the chiefe of the Leuites was maister of the song: for he taught other to sing, because he was a man of vnderstanding.
{15:23} Berechia and Elcana kept the doore of the arke.
{15:24} And Sebaniahu, Iehosaphat, Nathanael, Amasai, Zachariahu, Banaiahu, and Eliezer the priestes did blowe with trumpettes before the arke of God: And Obed Edom and Iehia were kepers of the doore of the arke.
{15:25} And Dauid and the elders of Israel, and the captaynes ouer thousandes, went to fet the arke of the appoyntmet of the Lorde out of the house of Obed Edom with gladnesse.
{15:26} And when God helped the Leuites that bare the arke of the appoyntment of the Lorde, they offered seuen oxen, and seuen rammes.
{15:27} And Dauid had on him a linnen garment, lyke as had also all the Leuites that bare the arke, & so had the singers and Chenania the ruler of the songe, with the singers: and Dauid had vpon him an Ephod of linnen.
{15:28} And al they of Israel brought the arke of the Lordes couenaunt with showting, and blowing of the shawme, and trumpettes, making a noyse with cymbales, psalteries, and harpes.
{15:29} And as the arke of the appointment of the Lorde came into the citie of Dauid, Michol the daughter of Saul looking out at a windowe, sawe king Dauid daunsing and playing, and she despised him in her heart.
{16:1} So they brought in the arke of God, and set it in the middest of the tent that Dauid pitched for it: And they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offringes before God.
{16:2} And when Dauid had made an end of offring the burnt offringes and peace offringes, he blessed the people in the name of the Lorde.
{16:3} And he dealt to all Israel both man and woman, a cracknel of bread, and a good peece of fleshe, and a flacket of wine.
{16:4} And he appoynted certaine of the Leuites to minister before the arke of the Lord, and to repeate, and to thanke and prayse the Lorde God of Israel.
{16:5} And Asaph was the chiefe, and nexte to him Zacharia, Ieiel, Semiramoth, Iehiel, Mathathia, Eliab, Benaia, Obed Edom, & Ieiel with instruments, psalteries, & harpes: But Asaph made a sounde with cymbales.
{16:6} Banaia and Iahaziel priestes blewe with trumpettes continually before the arke of the couenaunt of God.
{16:7} And that same tyme Dauid did appoynt chiefely to thanke the Lorde by Asaph and his brethren.
{16:8} Confesse you it vnto God, call vpon his name: cause the people to vnderstande his deuises.
{16:9} Sing vnto him, sing psalmes vnto him: talke you of all his wonderous workes.
{16:10} Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them reioyce that do seeke God.
{16:11} Seeke God and his strength: seeke his face euermore.
{16:12} Remember the marueylous workes that he hath done: his wonders, and the iudgementes of his mouth,
{16:13} O ye seede of Abraham his seruaunt, ye his chosen children of Iacob:
{16:14} (16:13) he is God our Lorde, his iudgementes are in all the earth.
{16:15} (16:14) He hath ben mindfull alwayes of his couenaunt (for he promysed a word to a thousande generations:)
{16:16} (16:14) euen of his couenaunt that he made with Abraham, and of his othe vnto Isaac.
{16:17} (16:15) And he appoynted the same vnto Iacob for a law: and to Israel for an euerlasting couenaunt.
{16:18} (16:16) Saying, vnto thee I wyll geue the lande of Chanaan: the lot of your inheritaunce.
{16:19} (16:17) When they were a fewe men in number, and had ben straungers but a litle while in it:
{16:20} (16:17) and when they went from one nation to another, from one kingdome to another people,
{16:21} (16:18) He suffred no man to do them wrong: yea he reproued euen kinges for their sakes.
{16:22} (16:19) Touche not myne annoynted: and triumph not ouer my prophetes.
{16:23} (16:20) Sing vnto the Lorde all the earth: and shewe from day to day his saluation.
{16:24} (16:21) Tell of his glory among the heathen: his wonderfull deedes among all natitions.
{16:25} For great is the Lorde, and worthy to be praysed exceedingly: he is to be feared aboue all gods.
{16:26} For all the gods of the people are but idoles: but the Lorde made heauen.
{16:27} Prayse and honour are in his presence: strength and gladnesse are in his place.
{16:28} Asscribe vnto the Lord ye kinredes of people, Asscribe to the Lorde glorie and dominion.
{16:29} Asscribe vnto the Lord the glorie due vnto his name, bring sacrifices, and come before him, and worship the Lord in his glorious sanctuarie.
{16:30} Let all the earth feare him: surely the world shalbe stable and not moue.
{16:31} Let the heauens reioyce, and let the earth be glad, and let men tel among the nations that the Lorde is king.
{16:32} Let the sea rore & the fulnesse thereof: let the fieldes reioyce, & all that is therin.
{16:33} Then shall the trees of the wood reioyce at the presence of the Lord, because he commeth to iudge the earth.
{16:34} O geue thankes vnto the Lorde, for he is good, for his mercie endureth euer:
{16:35} And say ye, saue vs O God our saluation, gather vs together, and deliuer vs from among the heathen, that we may geue thankes to thy holy name, and triumph in the prayse of thee.
{16:36} Blessed be the Lord God of Israel for euer and euer: & let all people say Amen, and prayse the Lorde.
{16:37} And so he left there before the arke of the lordes couenaunt Asaph & his brethren, to minister before the arke continually, in such thinges as were to be done day by day.
{16:38} And Obed Edom and his brethren, threescore and eyght, and Obed Edom the sonne of Ieduthun, and Hosa, were appoynted to be porters.
{16:39} And Zadoc the priest & his brethren the priestes were before ye tabernacle of the lord, in the hie place that was at Gibeon,
{16:40} To offer burnt offeringes vnto the Lorde vpon the burnt offering aulter perpetually, in the morning and euening, according to all that which is written in the lawe of the Lorde whiche he commaunded Israel.
{16:41} And with them were Heman and Ieduthun, and other that were chosen, whose names were expressed to geue thankes to the Lorde, That his mercie lasteth euer.
{16:42} And with them dyd Heman and Ieduthun sing with the trumpets and cymbales, making a sweete melodie with instrumentes of musicke & godly songues: And the sonnes of Ieduthun were porters.
{16:43} And al the people departed euery man to his house, & Dauid returned to blesse his house.
{17:1} And it fortuned, that when Dauid dwelt in his house, he sayde to Nathan the prophete: Lo, I dwel in an house of Cedar tree, but the arke of the lordes couenaunt remayneth vnder curtaynes.
{17:2} And Nathan sayde vnto Dauid: Do all that is in thyne heart, for God is with thee.
{17:3} And the same night, it fortuned that the worde of God came to, Nathan, saying:
{17:4} Go and tell Dauid my seruaunt, thus sayth the Lorde, Thou shalt not buylde me an house to dwell in:
{17:5} For I haue dwelt in no house sence the day that I brought out the children of Israel, vnto this day: but haue gone from tent to tent, and from one habitation to an other.
{17:6} And whersoeuer I haue walked with all Israel, spake I euer one worde to any of the iudges of Israel, whom I commaunded to feede my people, saying, Why haue ye not buylt me an house of Cedar tree?
{17:7} Nowe therfore thus shalt thou say vnto my seruaunt Dauid, thus sayth the Lorde of hoastes: I toke thee from the sheepe coate, and from folowing the sheepe, that thou shouldest be captayne ouer my people Israel:
{17:8} And I haue ben with thee whyther soeuer thou hast walked, and haue weeded out all thyne enemies out of thy sight, & haue made thee a name like the name of the greatest men that are in the earth.
{17:9} And I haue ordeyned a place for my people Israel and made it fast, so that nowe they may dwell in their place, and moue no more: Neither shall the children of wickednesse vexe them any more as at the beginning.
{17:10} And sence the time that I commaunded iudges to be ouer my people Israel, I haue subdued all thyne enemies: and I told thee that the Lord would buyld thee an house.
{17:11} This also shal come to passe: when thy dayes be expired that thou must go vnto thy fathers, I will rayse vp thy seede after thee, which shalbe of thy sonnes, and I will stablishe his kingdome.
{17:12} He shall buylde me an house, and I wil stablishe his seate for euer.
{17:13} I wilbe his father, and he shalbe my sonne, and I will not take my mercie away from him, as I toke it from hym that was before thee.
{17:14} But I wil stablishe him in myne house and my kingdome for euer, and his seate shalbe sure for euermore.
{17:15} According to all these wordes, and according to al this vision, did Nathan tell king Dauid.
{17:16} And Dauid the king came and sate before the Lord, and sayde: What am I O Lord God, and what is myne houshold, that thou hast promoted me thus farre?
{17:17} And yet this seemed litle in thyne eyes, O God: But thou hast also spoken of thy seruauntes house for a great whyle to come, and hast loked vpon me as vpon a man of hye degree, O Lorde God.
{17:18} What shall Dauid desire more of thee for the honour of thy seruaunt? For thou hast knowen thy seruaunt.
{17:19} O Lord, for thy seruauntes sake, euen according to thine owne heart, hast thou done all this magnificence, to shewe all great thinges.
{17:20} Lord there is none like thee, neither is there any God saue thou, according to al that we haue hearde with our eares.
{17:21} Moreouer, what nation on the earth is like thy people Israel, to whom God hath vouchsafed to come and redeeme them to be his owne people, and to make thee a name of excellencie & terriblenes, with casting out nations from before the people, whom thou hast deliuered out of Egypt?
{17:22} Thy people of Israel diddest thou make thyne owne people for euer, and thou becamest their God.
{17:23} Therfore now Lord, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy seruaunt & his house, be true for euer, that thou Lord do as thou hast sayde:
{17:24} Let it come to passe, that thy name may be magnified for euer, that it may be said, The Lord of hoastes is the God of Israel, euen the God of Israel, and the house of Dauid thy seruaunt endureth stable before thee.
{17:25} For thou O my God, hast tolde thy seruaunt that thou wilt buylde him an house, and therefore thy seruaunt hath founde in his heart to pray before thee.
{17:26} And now Lorde, thou art God, & hast promised this goodnes vnto thy seruaut
{17:27} Nowe therefore let it be thy pleasure to blesse the house of thy seruaunt, that it may continue before thee for euer: For whom thou blessest O Lorde, the same is blessed for euer.
{18:1} And after this, it fortuned that Dauid smote the Philistines, & subdued them, and toke Geth and the townes that longed therto out of the handes of the Philistines.
{18:2} And he smote Moab, and the Moabites became Dauids seruauntes, and payde him tribute.
{18:3} And Dauid smote Hadarezer king of Zoba vnto Hanath, as he went to stablishe his dominion by the riuer Euphrates.
{18:4} And Dauid toke from him a thousand charets, and seuen thousande horsemen, and twentie thousande footemen, and lamed all the charet horses, and reserued of them an hundred charets.
{18:5} And when the Syrians of Damascon came to helpe Hadarezer king of Zoba, Dauid slue of the Syrians twentie and two thousande.
{18:6} And Dauid put souldiers in Syria Damascon, and the Syrians became Dauids seruauntes, and brought him tribute: And the Lord preserued Dauid in all that he went to.
{18:7} And Dauid toke the shieldes of golde that were on the seruauntes of Hadarezer, and brought them to Hierusalem.
{18:8} And from Tebhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezar, brought Dauid exceeding much brasse, wherwith Solomon made the brasen lauatorie, the pillers, and the vessels of brasse.
{18:9} And when Thou king of Hemath heard how Dauid had beaten al the strength of Hadarezer king of Zoba,
{18:10} He sent Hadoram his sone to king Dauid, to make peace with him, & to blesse him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and beaten him (for Thou had warre with Hadarezer) and Hadoram brought all maner of iewels of golde, siluer, and brasse, with him.
{18:11} And king Dauid dedicated them vnto the Lord, with the siluer and golde that he brought fro all nations, from Edom, fro Moab, from ye children of Ammon, from the Philistines, and from Amelec.
{18:12} And Abisai the sonne of Zaruia slue of the Edomites in the salt valley eyghteene thousande,
{18:13} And put souldiers in Edom, and all the Edomites became Dauid seruauntes: Thus the Lorde kept Dauid in all that he toke in hande.
{18:14} And Dauid raigned ouer all Israel, and executed iudgement and righteousnesse among all his people.
{18:15} And Ioab the sonne of Zaruia was ouer the hoast, & Iehosaphat the sonne of Ahilud recorder:
{18:16} And Zadoc the sonne of Ahitob and Abimelech the sonne of Abiathar were the priestes, and Sausa was scribe,
{18:17} And Banaiahu the sonne of Iehoiada was ouer the Crethites and the Phelethites: and the sonnes of Dauid were next vnto the king.
{19:1} After this, it chaunced that Nahas the king of the children of Ammon dyed, & his sonne raigned in his steade.
{19:2} And Dauid sayde: I will shewe kindnesse vnto Hanon the sonne of Nahas, because his father dealt kindly with me. And Dauid sent messengers to comfort him ouer the death of his father: And the seruauntes of Dauid came into the lande of the children of Ammon to Hanon, to comfort him.
{19:3} But the lordes of the children of Ammon sayd to Hanon: Thinkest thou that Dauid doeth honour thy father in thy sight, that he hath sent comforters vnto thee? Are not his seruauntes come to search, to loke, and espie out the land?
{19:4} Wherefore Hanon toke Dauids seruauntes, and shaued them, and cut of their coates harde by their buttockes, & sent them away.
{19:5} And there went certayne and told Dauid how the men were serued: And the king sent to meete them (for the men were exceedingly ashamed) and the king sayde: Tary at Iericho vntill your beardes be growen, and then returne.
{19:6} And when the children of Ammon saw that they stanke in the sight of Dauid, Hanon and the children of Ammon sent a thousande talentes of siluer to hyre them charets and horsmen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria Maacha, and out of Zoba.
{19:7} And they hyred thirtie and two thousande charets, and the king of Maacha and his people: which came and pitched before Medeba: And the children of Ammon gathered them selues together fro their cities, and came to battayle.
{19:8} And when Dauid hearde of it, he sent Ioab and all the hoast of strong men.
{19:9} And the children of Ammon came out, and put them selues in aray to battayle before the gate of the citie: And ye kinges that were come, kept them by them selues backe in the fielde.
{19:10} When Ioab also saw that the frunt of the battayle was against him before and behind, he chose out of al the chosen men of Israel, and put them in aray against the Syrians.
{19:11} And the rest of ye people he deliuered vnto the hand of Abisai his brother, & they put them selues in aray against the children of Ammon.
{19:12} And he sayde: If the Syrians be to strong for me, thou shalt succour me, and if the children of Ammon preuayle against thee, I will helpe thee.
{19:13} Plucke vp thyne heart, and let vs play the men for our peoples sake, and for the cities of our God: and the Lord shall do that which is good in his owne sight.
{19:14} So Ioab and the people that were with him, drue nye before the Syrians vnto the battayle: and they fled before him.
{19:15} And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they ran away likewise before Abisai his brother, and gat them into the citie: and Ioab came to Hierusalem.
{19:16} And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers and set out the Syrians that were beyond the riuer: and Sophach the captayne of the hoast of Hadarezer went before them.
{19:17} And it was told Dauid: and he gathered all Israel, and went together ouer Iordane, and came and set vpon them: And when Dauid had put hym selfe in aray against the Syrians, they fought with him.
{19:18} But the Syrians fled before Israel, and Dauid destroyed of the Syrians seuen thousand charets, and fourtie thousand footemen, and killed Sophach the captayne of the hoast.
{19:19} And when the seruauntes of Hadarezer sawe that they were put to ye worse before them of Israel, they made peace with Dauid, & became his seruauntes: Neither would the Syrians helpe the children of Ammon any more.
{20:1} And it came to passe, that after the yere was expired( about ye time that kinges go out a warrefare) Ioab caryed out the armie of the hoast, and destroyed the countrey of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabba, and destroyed it: But Dauid taried at Hierusalem whyle Ioab smote Rabba and destroyed it.
{20:2} And Dauid toke the crowne of their king from of his head, and founde that it had the wayght of a talent of golde, and there were precious stones in it, and it was set vpon Dauids head: And he brought also exceeding much spoyle out of the citie.
{20:3} And he brought out the people that were in it, and tormented them with sawes and harrowes of iron, and with other sharpe instrumentes, and so dealt Dauid with all the cities of the children of Ammon: And Dauid and all the people came againe to Hierusalem.
{20:4} After this, it fortuned that there arose warre at Gazer with the Philistines: at which time Sobokai the Husathite slue Sippai that was of the children of Rephaim, and they were subdued.
{20:5} And there was battayle agayne with the Philistines, & Elhanan the sonne of Iair slue Lahemi the brother of Goliah the Gethite, whose speare was lyke a weauers beame.
{20:6} And there chaunced yet againe warre at Geth, where as was a man of a great stature, with twentie and foure fingers and toes, sixe on euery hand, and sixe on euery foote, and was the sonne of Raphah.
{20:7} But when he defyed Israel, Iehonathan the sonne of Simea Dauids brother slue him.
{20:8} These were borne vnto Raphah at Geth, and were ouerthrowen in the hande of Dauid and in the hande of his seruauntes.
{21:1} And Satan stoode vp against Israel, and prouoked Dauid to number Israel.
{21:2} And Dauid sayde to Ioab and to the rulers of the people: Go ye and number Israel from Beerseba to Dan: & bring it to me, that I may knowe the number of them.
{21:3} And Ioab aunswered: The Lorde make his people an hundred times so many mo as they be: But my lorde, O king, are they not all my lordes seruauntes? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will my lorde be a cause of trespasse to Israel?
{21:4} Neuerthelesse the kinges word preuayled against Ioab: And Ioab departed, and walked throughout all them of Israel, and came to Hierusalem againe,
{21:5} And gaue the summe of the number of the people vnto Dauid: And all they of Israel were a thousande thousand and an hundred thousande men that drue sworde: and Iuda was foure hundred threescore and ten thousande men that drue sworde.
{21:6} But the Leuites and Beniamin counted he not among them: For the kinges word was abhominable to Ioab.
{21:7} And the Lorde was displeased with this thing, and smote Israel.
{21:8} And Dauid sayde vnto God: I haue sinned exceedingly in doyng this thing: And nowe I besech thee, do away the wickednesse of thy seruaunt, for I haue done very foolyshly.
{21:9} And the Lord spake vnto Gad Dauids sear, saying:
{21:10} Go, and tell Dauid, saying, thus sayth the Lord, I geue thee the choyse of three thinges: choose the one of them, that I may do vnto thee.
{21:11} And Gad came to Dauid, and sayd vnto him, thus sayth the Lorde: Choose thee
{21:12} Eyther three yeres famishment, or three monethes to be destroyed before thyne aduersaries, & that the sworde of thyne enemies may ouertake thee: or els the sworde of the Lord and pestilence in the lande three dayes, and the angell of the Lorde destroying throughout all the coastes of Israel: And nowe aduise thy selfe, what worde I shal bring againe to him that sent me.
{21:13} And Dauid sayde vnto Gad, I am in an exceeding strayte: Let me fall nowe into the hande of the Lorde (for passing great are his mercies) but let me not fal into the hand of men.
{21:14} So the Lorde sent pestilence vpon Israel: and there were ouerthrowen of Israel threescore and ten thousande men.
{21:15} And God sent the angell into Hierusalem to destroy it: And as he was about to destroy, the Lorde behelde, and had compassion on the euyll, & sayde to the angel that destroyed: It is enough, let nowe thyne hand ceasse. And the angel of the Lorde stoode by the threshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite.
{21:16} And Dauid lift vp his eyes, and sawe the angell of the Lorde stand betweene the earth and heauen, hauing a drawen sword in his hand, stretched out toward Hierusalem: Then Dauid and the elders of Israel whiche were clothed in sacke, fell vpon their faces.
{21:17} And Dauid sayde vnto God: Is it not I that commaunded the people to be numbred? It is I that haue sinned and done euyll in deede: and what haue these sheepe done? Let thyne hande O Lorde my God be on me, and on my fathers house: but not on thy people, that they shoulde be punished.
{21:18} And the angell of the Lord commaunded Gad to say to Dauid, that Dauid shoulde go vp and set vp an aulter vnto the Lorde in the threshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite.
{21:19} And Dauid went vp according to the saying of Gad whiche he spake in the name of the Lorde.
{21:20} And Ornan turned about, and saw the angell, and his foure sonnes were with him, and hyd them selues: But Ornan was threshing wheate.
{21:21} And as Dauid came to Ornan, Ornan loked and sawe Dauid, and went out of the threshing floore, and bowed hym selfe to Dauid with his face to the grounde.
{21:22} And Dauid sayde to Ornan: Geue me the place of the threshing floore, that I may buylde an aulter therin vnto the lord: Thou shalt geue it me for as much money as it is worth, that the plague may ceasse from the people.
{21:23} And Ornan sayd vnto Dauid: Take it to thee, and let my lorde the king do that which seemeth good in his eyes: Lo, I geue thee oxen also for burnt sacrifices, and treshing instrumentes for wood, & wheate for meate offring, I geue it all.
{21:24} And king Dauid sayde to Ornan: Not so, but I will bye it for as much money as it is worth: For I will not take that whiche is thyne for the Lorde, nor offer burnt offringes without coast.
{21:25} And so Dauid gaue to Ornan for that place sicles of golde sixe hundred by wayght.
{21:26} And Dauid buylt there an aulter vnto the Lorde, and offred burnt offringes and peace offringes, and called vpon the Lorde, and he hearde him from heauen in fire vpon the aulter of burnt offring.
{21:27} And when the Lorde had spoken to the angel, he put vp his sword againe into the sheathe of it.
{21:28} At that time when Dauid sawe that the Lorde had hearde him in the thresshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite, he vsed to offer there:
{21:29} For the tabernacle of the Lorde which Moyses made in the wildernesse, & the aulter of burnt offring, were at that season in the hill of Gibeon:
{21:30} And Dauid coulde not go before it, to aske counsell at God, for he was afrayde of the sword of the angel of the Lorde.
{22:1} And Dauid said: This is the house of the lord God, & this is the aulter for the burnt offring of Israel.
{22:2} And Dauid commaunded to gather together the straungers that were in the lande of Israel, and he set masons to hew and pullishe stones for the building of the house of God.
{22:3} And Dauid prepared plentie of iron for nayles, & doores of the gates, & to ioyne withal, and aboundaunce of brasse without wayght,
{22:4} And Cedar trees without number: For the Zidons and they of Tyre brought much Cedar wood to Dauid.
{22:5} And Dauid sayde: Solomon my sonne is young and tender, and the house that is to be buylded for the Lorde must be magnificall, excellent, and of great fame and dignitie throughout all countreys: I wil therfore make ordinaunces for it. And so Dauid prepared many thinges before his death.
{22:6} And he called Solomon his sonne, and charged him to buylde an house for the Lorde God of Israel.
{22:7} And Dauid sayde to Solomon: My sonne, I thought as it was in myne heart to buylde an house vnto the name of the Lorde my God:
{22:8} But the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Thou hast shed much blood, and hast made great battayles: thou shalt therefore not buylde an house vnto my name, for thou hast shed much blood vpon the earth in my sight.
{22:9} Behold, a sonne is borne to thee, and he shalbe a man of rest, for I wil geue him rest from all his enemies rounde about: For his name is Solomon, & I wil send rest and peace vpon Israel in his dayes.
{22:10} He shall buylde an house for my name, and he shalbe my sonne, and I wilbe his father, and I wil establishe the seate of his kingdome vpon Israel for euer.
{22:11} Nowe therfore my sonne, the Lorde be with thee, and prosper thee, and thou shalt buylde an house to the Lorde thy God, as he hath sayde of thee.
{22:12} And the Lord shall geue thee wysdom and vnderstanding, and shall geue thee commaundementes for Israel, that thou mayst kepe the lawe of the Lorde thy God.
{22:13} For then thou shalt prosper, euen when thou takest heede and fulfillest the statutes and lawes which the Lorde charged Moyses with for Israel: Plucke vp thyne hearte therfore, & be strong, dread not, nor be discouraged.
{22:14} Behold, according to my pouertie haue I also prepared for the house of the Lorde, an hundred thousande talentes of golde, and a thousande thousande talentes of siluer: and as for brasse & iron, it can not be nubred, (for it is verie much) And I haue prepared timber and stone, and thou mayest prouide more thereto.
{22:15} Moreouer, thou hast workemen with thee mowe, and masons, and carpenters to worke in stone and timber, & many men that be actiue for euery worke,
{22:16} And of golde, siluer, brasse, & iron, there is no number: Up therefore, and be doing, and the Lorde shalbe with thee.
{22:17} And Dauid commaunded al the lordes of Israel to helpe Solomon his sonne, saying:
{22:18} Is not the Lord your God with you? and hath he not geuen you rest on euery side? for he hath geuen the inhabitours of the lande into my hande, and the land is subdued before the Lorde, and before his people.
{22:19} Nowe therefore set your heartes and your soules to seke the Lord your God: Up, and buylde ye the temple of the Lord God, to bring the arke of the couenaunt of the Lorde and the holy vessels of God into the house so buylt for the name of the Lorde.
{23:1} So when Dauid was olde and full of dayes, he made Solomon his sonneking ouer Israel.
{23:2} And then he gathered together all the lordes of Israel, with the priestes and the Leuites.
{23:3} And the Leuites were numbred from the age of thirtie yeres and aboue: and the number and summe of them was thirtie and eyght thousande men.
{23:4} Of which twentie and foure thousand were set to further the worke of the house of the Lorde: and sixe thousande were officers and iudges.
{23:5} Foure thousande were porters, & foure thousand praysed the Lorde with such instrumentes as was made to prayse withall.
{23:6} And so Dauid put an order among them deuiding them, in partes: Of the children of Leui, Gerson, Caath, and Merari.

{23:11} And Iahath was the chiefe, Ziza the seconde: but Ieus, and Beria had not many sonnes, therfore they were in one reckening according to their fathers housholde, reckened for one auncient housholde.
{23:12} The sonnes of Caath: Amram, Izahar, Hebron, and Uzziel, foure.
{23:13} The sonnes of Amram: Aaron, and Moyses: And Aaron was separated to haue the rule of the holy thinges in the place most holy, he & his sonnes for euer, and to burne incense before the Lorde, and to minister vnto him, and to blesse in his name for euer.
{23:14} Moyses also the man of God, and his children, were named with the tribe of Leui.

{23:25} And Dauid sayde: The Lorde God of Israel hath geuen rest vnto his people, that they may dwell in Hierusalem for euer.
{23:26} That the Leuites also shoulde nowe no more beare the tabernacle, and al the vessels for the seruice thereof.
{23:27} For according to the last wordes of Dauid, the Leuites were numbred from twentie yeres and aboue.
{23:28} And their office was vnder the hande of the sonnes of Aaron, for the seruice of the house of the Lorde in the courtes and celles, and in the purifying of all holy thinges, and in the worke of the seruice of the house of God:
{23:29} In the shewbread, in the fine flowre, in the meate offring, in ye wafers of sweete bread, in the frying panne, in the gredyron, and in all maner of measures & sise:
{23:30} And to stand euery day in the morning to thanke and prayse the Lorde, and so likewise at euen:
{23:31} And to offer all burnt sacrifices vnto the Lord, in the Sabbathes, in the new moones, and on the feastfull dayes, by number and custome continually as they were commaunded, before the Lord.
{23:32} And that they should wayte on the tabernacle of the congregation, & on the holy place, and on the sonnes of Aaron their brethre, in the seruice of the house of the Lord.
{24:1} These are the deuisions of the sonnes of Aaro. The sonnes of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
{24:2} Nadab also and Abihu dyed before their father, & had no children: But Eleazar, & Ithamar executed the priestes office.

{24:4} And there were mo auncient men founde among the sonnes of Eleazar, then the sonnes of Ithamar. And thus were they ordred together: Among the sonnes of Eleazar there were sixteene rulers according to the houshold of their fathers, and eyght among the sonnes of Ithamar according to the housholde of their fathers.
{24:5} And thus were they put in order by lot the one sort from the other: and so were there rulers in the sanctuarie and lordes before God, aswell of the sonnes of Eleazer, as of the sonnes of Ithamar.
{24:6} And Semeia the sonne of Nathanael the scribe, of the kinred of the Leuites, wrote them before the king & the lordes, & before Zadoc the priest and Ahimelec the sonne of Abiathar, and before the auncient fathers of the priestes and Leuites, one principall housholde being reserued for Eleazar, and one for Ithamar.

{25:1} And so Dauid and the captaynes of the hoast appoynted out to do seruice the sonnes of Asaph, and Heman, & Ieduthun, which should prophecie with harpes, psalteries, and cymbales: And there was a multitude of the men that were appoynted to the seruice and ministration:

{28:3} But God saide vnto me: thou shalt not builde an house for my name, because thou hast ben a man of warre, and hast shed blood.
{28:4} Moreouer the Lorde God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father, to be king ouer Israel for euer: for in Iuda would he choose a captaine, & of the householde of Iuda is the house of my father, & among the sonnes of my father he had a lust to me to make me king ouer all Israel.
{28:5} And of all my sonnes (for the Lorde hath geuen me many sonnes) he hath chosen Solomon my sonne, to sit vpon the seate of the kingdome of the Lorde in Israel.
{28:6} And he saide vnto me: Solomon thy sonne he shall builde me an house and courtes: I haue chosen him to be my sonne, and I will be his father.
{28:7} I wyll stablishe his kingdome for euer, if he wyll be strong to do my commaundementes and my lawes, as it goeth this day.

{28:9} And thou Solomon my sonne, knowe thou the God of thy father, and serue him with a pure heart and with a wyllyng minde: For the Lord searcheth al heartes, and vnderstandeth all the immaginations of thoughtes: And if thou seeke him, he wyll be founde of thee: but if thou forsake him, he wyll cast thee of for euer.
{28:10} Take heede now, for the Lorde hath chosen thee to builde him an house of a sanctuarie: Be strong therefore & play the man.
{28:11} And Dauid gaue Solomon his sonne the paterne of the porche, and of the houses that longed thereto, of the storehouses, vpper chambers, inner parlours, and of the house of the mercie seate:
{28:12} And the example of all that he had in his minde for the courtes of the house of the Lorde, and for all the celles rounde about, for the treasures of the house of God, and for the treasures of the dedicate thinges:
{28:13} For the deuisions of the priestes and Leuites that wayted by course, and for al the workemanship that should serue for the house of the Lorde, and for all the vessels that shoulde serue in the house of the Lorde:
{28:14} For golde, and for the waight of golde, for all vessels of sundry ministrations, for all maner of vessels of siluer in waight, and for all vessels whatsoeuer purpose they serued vnto:

{28:19} All he sayde was geuen me by wryting of the hande of the Lorde, which made me vnderstand al the workemanship of the patterne.
{28:20} And Dauid said to Solomon his sonne: be strong & of good courage, & do manfullye, feare not nor be faint hearted, for ye lord God, euen my God, is with thee, & he shall not faile thee, nor forsake thee, vntill thou hast finished al ye worke that must serue for the house of the Lorde.
{28:21} Beholde, the priestes and Leuites are deuided in companies for all maner of seruice that pertayneth to the house of God, they are with thee for all maner of workmanship, and so are al that excel in wysedome, for any maner of seruice: thou hast also the princes and all the people who ly at thy commaundement.
{29:1} And Dauid the king saide vnto all the congregation: God hath specially chosen Solomon my sonne which is yet young & tender, & the worke is great: for the house shall not be for man, but for the Lorde God.
{29:2} Moreouer, I haue prepared with all my might for the house of my God, golde for vessels of golde, siluer for them of siluer, brasse for thinges of brasse, iron for thinges of iron, & wood for thynges of wood, and onix stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of diuers colours, & al maner of precious stones, & marble stones in great aboundaunce.
{29:3} And because I haue lust to the house of my God, I haue of myne owne proper good of golde and siluer which I haue geuen to the house of my God, beside all that I haue prepared for the holy house,
{29:4} Euen three thousand talentes of golde of Ophir, and seuen thousand talentes of tried siluer, to ouer laye the walles of the house withall.
{29:5} The golde for thinges of golde, siluer for them of siluer, and for all maner of worke by the handes of artificers: And whosoeuer is wylling, may this day consecrate his hande vnto the Lorde.
{29:6} And so the auncient fathers and the lordes of the tribes of Israel, the captaynes of thousandes and hundredes, with the lordes that were rulers ouer the kinges worke, were willing,
{29:7} And gaue for the seruice of the house of God, fiue thousand talentes of golde, and ten thousand peeces of golde, and ten thousand talentes of siluer, & eyghtteene thousand talentes of brasse, and one hundred thousand talentes of iron.
{29:8} And they with whom precious stones were founde, gaue them to the treasure of the house of the Lord by the hand of Iehiel the Gersonite.
{29:9} And the people reioyced when they were so wylling to geue their goodes, and with a perfect heart they offered wyllingly to the Lord: And Dauid the king reioyced with great gladnesse.
{29:10} And Dauid blessed the Lorde before all the congregation, and sayde: Blessed be thou Lorde God of Israel, our father from euer and for euer.
{29:11} Thyne O Lorde is greatnesse, and power, glory, victorie, and prayse: for all that is in heauen and in earth is thyne, and thyne is the kingdome O Lorde, and thou excellest aboue all, euen as the head of all.
{29:12} And richesse and honour come of thee, and thou raignest ouer all, and in thyne hande is power & strength, and in thyne hand it is to make great and to geue strength vnto all.
{29:13} And nowe our God we thanke thee, and prayse thy glorious name.
{29:14} But who am I? and what is my people? that we should enforce our selues to geue these thinges so willingly? But all thinges come of thee, & of that which we receaued at thyne hand, we haue geuen thee.
{29:15} For we be but straungers before thee, and soiourners, as were al our fathers: Our dayes on the earth also are but as a shadowe, and there is none abiding.
{29:16} O Lorde our God, all this stuffe that we haue prepared to builde thee an house for thy holy name, commeth of thyne hand, and is all thyne.
{29:17} I wot also my God that thou tryest the heartes, and hast pleasure in vnfaynednesse, & in the vnfaonednesse of myne heart I haue wyllingly offered al these thinges: And now haue I seene thy people which are founde here to offer vnto thee wyllyngly, and with gladnesse.
{29:18} O Lorde God of Abraham, Isahac, and of Israel our fathers, keepe this for euer in the desire of the thoughtes of the heart of thy people, & prepare their heartes vnto thee.
{29:19} And geue vnto Solomon my sonne a perfect heart, to keepe thy commaundementes, thy testimonies, & thy statutes, and to do all, and builde the house, for the which I haue made prouision.
{29:20} And Dauid saide to all the congregation: Now blesse the Lorde your God. And all the congregation blessed the Lorde God of their fathers, and bowed downe their heades, and worshipped the Lorde and the king.
{29:21} And they offered offringes vnto the Lorde: And on the morowe after the saide day, they offred burnt offringes vnto the Lorde, euen a thousand young oxen, a thousand rammes, and a thousand sheepe, with their drinke offrings: Many sacrifices offred they for all Israel,
{29:22} And did eate & drinke before the Lord the same day with great gladnesse: And they made Solomon the sonne of Dauid king the second time, and annoynted him prince before the Lorde, and Zadoc to be the hie priest.
{29:23} And Solomon sate on the seate of the Lorde, and was king in steade of Dauid his father, and prospered: and all they of Israel obeyed him.
{29:24} And all the lordes and men of power, and all the sonnes of king Dauid, submitted them selues, & were vnder king Solomon.
{29:25} And the Lorde magnified Solomon in dignitie in the sight of all them of Israel, and gaue him so glorious a kingdome, as no king had before him in Israel.
{29:26} And so Dauid the sonne of Isai raigned ouer all Israel.
{29:27} And the space that he raigned ouer Israel, was fouretie yeres: Seuen yeres raigned he in Hebron, and thirtie and three yeres raigned he in Hierusalem.
{29:28} And he dyed in a good age, ful of dayes, riches, and honour: and Solomon his sonne raigned in his steade.
{29:29} The actes of Dauid the king first and last, beholde they are written in the booke of Samuel the sear, and in the booke of Nathan the prophete, and in the booke of Gad the sear:
{29:30} With all his kingdome, and power, and times, that went ouer him, & ouer all Israel, and ouer all the kingdomes of the earth.
