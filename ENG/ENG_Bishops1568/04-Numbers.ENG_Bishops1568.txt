{1:50} But thou shalt appoynt the Leuites ouer the tabernacle of wytnesse, & ouer all the vessels therof, and ouer all thinges that are in it: Yea, they shall beare the tabernacle, and all the vessels therof, and they shall minister in it, and shall dwell rounde about the tabernacle.
{1:51} And whe the tabernacle goeth foorth, the Leuites shall take it downe: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Leuites shal set it vp: and if any straunger come nye, he shall dye.
{1:52} And the chyldren of Israel shall pitch their tentes, euery man in his owne campe, and euery man vnder his owne standerd throughout their hoastes.
{1:53} But the Leuites shall pitche rounde about the tabernacle of wytnesse, that there be no wrath vpon the congregation of the chyldren of Israel: and the Leuites shall kepe the watche of the tabernacle of wytnesse.
{1:54} And the chyldren of Israel dyd accordyng to all that the Lorde commaunded Moyses, euen so dyd they.
{2:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses and Aaron, saying:
{2:2} Euery man of the chyldren of Israel shal pitche vnder his owne standerd, & vnder the ensigne of their fathers houses: farre of about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitche.

{2:17} And the tabernacle of the congregation shall go with the hoast of the Leuites, in the middes of the campe: And as they lye in their tentes, euen so shall they proceede in the iourney, euery man in his degree, and vnder their owne standerdes.

{2:32} These are the summes of the chyldren of Israel throughout the houses of their fathers, euen all the numbers that pitched throughout their hoastes, sixe hundred thousande, three thousand, fiue hundred and fiftie.
{2:33} But the Leuites were not numbred among the chyldren of Israel, as the Lorde commaunded Moyses.
{2:34} And the chyldren of Israel dyd accordyng to all that the Lorde commaunded Moyses, so they pitched with their standerdes, and so they iourneyed euery one throughout their kinredes, according to the housholdes of their fathers.
{3:1} These also are the generations of Aaron and Moyses, in ye day that the Lorde spake with Moyses in mount Sinai.
{3:2} And these are the names of the sonnes of Aaron: Nadab the eldest sonne, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
{3:3} These are the names of the sonnes of Aaron whiche were priestes annoynted, and whose hande was consecrated to minister.
{3:4} And Nadab and Abihu dyed before the Lorde, when they offred straunge fire befor the Lorde in the wyldernesse of Sinai, and had no chyldren: And Eleazar and Ithamar ministred in the sight of Aaron their father.
{3:5} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{3:6} Bryng the tribe of Leui, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may serue hym:
{3:7} And take the charge with hym, euen the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the seruice of the tabernacle.
{3:8} They shall kepe all the instrumentes of the tabernacle of the congregation, & haue the charge of the chyldren of Israel, to do the seruice of the tabernacle.
{3:9} And thou shalt geue the Leuites vnto Aaron and to his sonnes: for they are geuen and deliuered vnto hym of the chyldren of Israel.
{3:10} And thou shalt appoynt Aaron and his sonnes to wayte on their priestes office: and the straunger that commeth nye, shalbe slayne.
{3:11} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{3:12} Beholde, I haue taken the Leuites from among the chyldren of Israel for all the first borne that openeth the matrice among the chyldren of Israel, and the Leuites shalbe mine.
{3:13} Because all the first borne are myne: for the same day that I smote all the first borne in the lande of Egypt, I halowed vnto me all the first borne in Israel, both man and beast, and mine they shalbe: I am the Lorde.
{3:14} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses in the wyldernesse of Sinai, saying:
{3:15} Number the chyldren of Leui after the houses of their fathers in their kinredes: All that are males from a moneth old and aboue, shalt thou number.
{3:16} And Moyses numbred them, according to the worde of the Lorde, as he was commaunded.

{5:4} And the children of Israel dyd so, and put them out of the hoast: euen as the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, so dyd the children of Israel.
{5:5} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{5:6} Speake vnto the children of Israel: When a man or woman shall commit any sinne that men comit, and trespasse agaynst the Lorde: when that person shall trespasse,
{5:7} Then they shall knowledge their sinne which they haue done, and let hym restore againe the hurt that he hath done, with his principall, and put the fift part of it more therto, and geue it vnto hym whom he hath trespassed agaynst.
{5:8} But and if the man haue no kinseman to restore the hurt vnto, let the trespasse be made good vnto the Lorde, and it shalbe the priestes, beside the Ramme of the attonement, wherby an attonement shalbe made for hym.
{5:9} And euery heaue offering that is made of the holy thynges of the children of Israel which they bring vnto the priest, shalbe his.
{5:10} And euery mans halowed thynges shalbe his: whatsoeuer any man geueth the priest, it shalbe his.
{5:11} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{5:12} Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them: If any mans wyfe go aside, and trespasse agaynst hym,
{5:13} So that another man lye with her fleshly, and it be hid from the eyes of her husbande, and is kept close that she is defyled, and there is no witnesse against her, neither she taken with the maner,
{5:14} And the spirite of gelousie commeth vpon hym, so that he is gelous ouer his wyfe which is defyled: or if the spirite of gelousie come vpon hym, so that he is gelous ouer his wyfe which is yet vndefyled:
{5:15} Then let the man bring his wyfe vnto the priest, and bring her offeryng with her, the tenth part of an Epha of barly meale: but let hym put no oyle vpon it, nor put frankensence theron, for it is an offeryng of gelousie, an offeryng for a remembraunce, causyng the sinne to be thought vpon.
{5:16} And the priest shall bryng her, and set her before the Lorde.
{5:17} And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and of the dust that is in the floore of the tabernacle, the priest shal take it, and put it into ye water.
{5:18} And let the priest set the woman before the Lorde, and vncouer the womans head, and put the offering of memoriall in her handes, which is the gelousie offeryng: and the priest shall haue bytter and cursed water in his hande.
{5:19} And the priest shall charge her by an othe, and say vnto the woman: If no man haue lyen with thee, neither hast gone aside to vncleannesse without thy husbande, then haue thou no harme of this bitter and cursed waters.
{5:20} But and if thou hast gone aside from thyne husbande, and art defiled, and some man hath lyen with thee beside thyne husbande:
{5:21} (Then ye priest shal charge the woman with an othe of cursing, & the priest shall say vnto the woman) the Lorde make thee accursed and detestable for the othe among the people, when the Lord doth make thy thigh to rot, & thy belly swell.
{5:22} These cursed waters go into the bowels of thee, that they may make thy belly swell, and thy thigh to rotte. And let the woman say, Amen amen.
{5:23} And let the priest write these curses in a booke, and shall blot them out with the bitter waters:
{5:24} And geue the woman those bitter and cursed waters to drinke, yt those cursed and bitter waters may enter into her.
{5:25} And then the priest shall take the gelousie offeryng out of the womans hande, and waue it before the Lorde, and bryng it vnto the aulter.
{5:26} And the priest shall take an handfull of the offeryng for a memoriall, & burne it vpon the aulter, and then make the woman drynke the waters:
{5:27} And when he hath made the woman drynke the waters, if she be defiled and haue trespassed agaynst her husbande, then shall the cursed and bytter waters go into her, and her belly shal swell, and her thigh shall rotte: and the woman shalbe a curse among her people.
{5:28} And yf the woman be not defiled, but is cleane, she shall haue no harme, but shall conceaue and beare.
{5:29} This is the lawe of gelousie, when a wyfe goeth aside from her husbande, and is defiled:
{5:30} Or when the spirit of gelousie cometh vpon a man, and he beyng gelous ouer his wyfe, doth bryng her before ye Lord: And the priest shall do to her accordyng vnto all this lawe,
{5:31} And the man shalbe giltlesse, and this woman shall beare her sinne.
{6:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{6:2} Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them: Whe either man or woman doth seperate them selues to vowe a vowe of a Nazarite, to seperate them selues vnto the Lorde:
{6:3} He shall seperate him selfe from wine and strong drynke, and shall drynke no vineger of wine or of strong drinke, nor shall drinke whatsoeuer is pressed out of grapes, and shall eate no freshe grapes, neither yet dried.
{6:4} As long as his abstinence endureth, shall he eate nothyng that is made of the vine tree, or of the cornels, or of the huske of the grape.
{6:5} And as long as he voweth and is seperated, there shall not rasure come vpon his head, vntyll his dayes be out in the which he seperateth hym selfe vnto the Lorde, he shalbe holy, and shall let the lockes of his heere growe.
{6:6} As long as he seperateth hym selfe vnto the Lorde, he shall come at no dead body.
{6:7} He shall not make hym selfe vncleane at the death of his father, mother, brother, or sister: because that the consecration of his God is vpon his head,
{6:8} All the dayes of his seperation, he is holy vnto the Lorde.
{6:9} And if any man dye sodenly before him, or he be ware, the head of his consecration shalbe defiled: and he shall shaue his head the day of his cleansyng, euen the seuenth day shall he shaue it.
{6:10} And the eyght day he shall bryng two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, before the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{6:11} And the priest shall offer the one for a sinne offeryng, and the other for a burnt offeryng: and make an attonement for hym as concernyng that he sinned by the dead, and shall halowe his head the same day.
{6:12} And he shall consecrate vnto the Lord the tyme of his seperation, & shall bring a lambe of a yere olde for a trespasse offeryng: but the dayes that were before are lost, because his consecration was defiled.
{6:13} This is the lawe of the Nazarite: when the tyme of his consecration is out, he shalbe brought vnto the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation:
{6:14} And he shall bryng his offeryng vnto the Lorde, an hee lambe of a yere olde without blemishe for a burnt offeryng, and a shee lambe of a yere olde without blemishe for a sinne offering, & a ramme without blemishe also for peace offerynges,
{6:15} And a basket of vnleauened bread, euen cakes of fine floure mingled with oyle, and wafers of vnleauened bread annoynted with oyle, with their meate offerynges and drynke offerynges.
{6:16} And the priest shall bryng them before the Lorde, and offer his sinne offeryng and his burnt offeryng.
{6:17} And shall prepare the ramme for a peace offering vnto the Lorde, with the basket of vnleauened bread: and the priest shall make also his meat offeryng and his drynke offeryng.
{6:18} And the Nazarite shal shaue the head of his consecration at the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shal take the heere of the head of his consecration, and put it in the fire which is vnder the peace offeryng.
{6:19} And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ramme, and one vnleauened cake out of the basket, and one vnleauened wafer also, and put them vpon the handes of the Nazarite, after he hath shauen his consecration.
{6:20} And the priest shall waue them before the Lorde: And these holy thynges shalbe the priestes, with the waue brest and the heaue shoulder: and then the Nazarite may drynke wine.
{6:21} This is the lawe of the Nazarite which hath vowed his offeryng vnto the Lorde for his consecration, besides those thynges that his hande can get: according to the vowe which he vowed, euen so he must do after the lawe of his consecration.
{6:22} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{6:23} Speake vnto Aaron and his sonnes, saying: On this wyse ye shall blesse the chyldren of Israel, and say vnto them:
{6:24} The Lorde blesse thee, and kepe thee:
{6:25} The Lorde make his face shine vpon thee, and be mercyfull vnto thee:
{6:26} The Lorde lyft vp his countenaunce vpon thee, and geue thee peace.
{6:27} And they shall put my name vpon the chyldren of Israel, and I wyll blesse them.
{7:1} And when Moyses had full set vp the tabernacle, & annoynted and sanctified it, and all the instrumentes therof, the aulter also & all the vessels therof: and had annoynted them & sanctified them.
{7:2} Then the princes of Israel, heades ouer the houses of their fathers (which were the lordes of the tribes, and ouer them that were numbred) offered,
{7:3} And brought their sacrifice before the Lorde, sixe couered charettes, & twelue oxen: one charet for two lordes, and for one an oxe, and they brought them before the tabernacle.
{7:4} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{7:5} Take it of them, that they may be to do the seruice of the tabernacle of the congregation, and thou shalt geue them vnto the Leuites, to euery man accordyng vnto his office.
{7:6} And Moyses toke the charettes and the oxen, & gaue them vnto the Leuites.
{7:7} Two charettes and foure oxen he gaue vnto the sonnes of Gerson, accordyng vnto their office.
{7:8} And foure charettes & eyght oxen he gaue vnto the sonnes of Merari, according vnto their offices, vnder ye hande of Ithamar the sonne of Aaron the priest.
{7:9} But vnto the sonnes of Caath he gaue none: because the charge of the sanctuarie belonged vnto them, which they dyd beare vpon shoulders.
{7:10} And the princes offered for the dedicatyng of the aulter in the day that it was annoynted, and brought their sacrifices before the aulter.

{8:7} And thus shalt thou do vnto them, when thou cleansest them: Sprinckle water of purifiyng vpon them, and let them shaue all their fleshe, and let them washe their clothes, and so make them selues cleane.
{8:8} Then let them take a young bullocke with his meate offeryng euen fine floure minged with oyle, and another young bullocke shalt thou take for a sinne offeryng.

{8:13} And thou shalt set the Leuites before Aaron and his sonnes, and waue them for a waue offeryng vnto the Lorde.
{8:14} And thus thou shalt seperate the Leuites from among the children of Israel, and the Leuites shalbe myne.
{8:15} After that, shall the Leuites go in, to do the seruice of the tabernacle of the congregation: And thou shalt cleanse them, & waue them for a waue offering:
{8:16} For they are geuen and deliuered vnto me from among the children of Israel for such as open euery wombe, euen for the first borne of all the children of Israel haue I taken them vnto me.
{8:17} For all the first borne of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: since the day that I smote euery first borne in the lande of Egypt, I sanctified them for my selfe.
{8:18} And I haue taken the Leuites for all the first borne of the children of Israel.
{8:19} And haue geuen the Leuites as a gift to Aaron and his sonnes from among the children of Israel, to do the seruice of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an attonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, if the children of Israel come nye vnto the sanctuarie.

{8:23} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{8:24} This is it that belongeth vnto the Leuites: From twentie and fiue yeres olde and vpwarde, they shall go in to wayte vpon the seruice of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{8:25} And from the age of fiftie yeres, they shall ceasse waytyng vpon the seruice therof, and shall serue no more:
{8:26} But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to kepe thynges committed to their charge: but shall do no more seruice. Thus therfore shalt thou do vnto the Leuites touchyng their charge,
{9:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses in the wildernesse of Sinai, in the first moneth of the seconde yere, after they were come out of the lande of Egypt, saying:
{9:2} Let the children of Israel celebrate the Passouer at the tyme appoynted thervnto:
{9:3} Euen ye fourteenth day of this moneth at euen: ye shall kepe it in his season accordyng to all the ceremonies of it, and according to all the maners therof, shall ye kepe it.
{9:4} And Moyses spake vnto the children of Israel, that they should celebrate the Passouer.
{9:5} And they kept the Passouer the foureteenth day of the first moneth at euen in the wildernesse of Sinai: according to all that the Lorde comaunded Moyses, euen so dyd the children of Israel.
{9:6} And certayne men were defiled by a dead man, that they myght not kepe the Passouer the same day, and they came before Moyses & Aaron the same day.
{9:7} And those men sayde vnto hym, we are defiled by a dead man: wherfore are we kept backe, that we may not offer an offeryng vnto the Lorde in due season, among the children of Israel?
{9:8} And Moyses sayd vnto them: Stande styll, and I wyll heare what the Lorde wyll commaunde concernyng you.
{9:9} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{9:10} Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say: If any man be vncleane by the reason of a coarse, or be in a way farre distaunt from you and from your generations, he shall kepe the Passouer vnto the Lorde.
{9:11} The fourteenth day of the seconde moneth at euen let them kepe it: and eate it with vnleauened bread, & sowre hearbes.
{9:12} Let them leaue none of it vnto the morning, nor breake any bone of it: But accordyng to all the ordinaunce of the Passouer, let them kepe it.
{9:13} But the man that is cleane, and is not in a iourney, and yet was negligent to kepe the Passouer: the same soule shalbe cut of from his people, because he brought not the offeryng of the Lorde in his due season, that man shall beare his sinne.
{9:14} And if a straunger dwell among you, and wyll kepe the Passouer vnto the Lorde: accordyng to the ordinance of the Passouer and maner therof, so shall he do. Ye shall haue one lawe both for the straunger, and for hym that was borne in the same lande.
{9:15} And the same day that the tabernacle was reared vp, a cloude couered the tabernacle, namely the tabernacle of the testimonie: and at euen, there was vpon the tabernacle, as it were the appearaunce of fire, vntyll the mornyng.
{9:16} So it was alway: the cloude couered it by day, and the appearaunce of fire by nyght.
{9:17} And when the cloude was taken vp from the tabernacle, then the children of, Israel iourneyed: and in the place where the cloude abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tentes.
{9:18} At the mouth of the Lorde the childre of Israel iourneyed, and at the mouth of the Lorde they pitched: And as long as the cloude abode vpon the tabernacle, they lay styll:
{9:19} And when the cloude taryed styll vpon the tabernacle long tyme, the children of Israel kept the watche of the Lorde, and iourneyed not.
{9:20} And when the cloude abode a fewe dayes vpon the tabernacle, they abode in their tentes, accordyng to the commaundement of the Lorde: and they iourneyed also at the commaundement of the Lorde.
{9:21} And when the cloude abode vpon the tabernacle from euen vnto the mornyng, & was taken vp in the mornyng, then they iourneyed: Whether it was by day or by nyght that the cloude was taken vp, they iourneyed.
{9:22} Or if the cloude taryed two dayes, or a moneth, or a yere vpon the tabernacle and remayned theron, the children of Israel remayned styll and iourneyed not: And assoone as the cloude was taken vp, they iourneyed.
{9:23} At the mouth of the Lord they rested in the tentes, and at the comaundement of the Lorde they iourneyed, kepyng the watche of the Lorde at the commaundement of the Lord by the hande of Moyses.
{10:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{10:2} Make thee two trumpettes of siluer: of an whole peece shalt thou make them, that thou mayest vse them to call the congregation together, and when the campe shall iourney.
{10:3} And when they shal blowe with them, all the multitude shall resort to thee before the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{10:4} And if they blowe but one trumpet, then the princes which are heades ouer the thousandes of Israel shall come vnto thee.
{10:5} But if ye blowe an alarme, the hoastes that lye on the east partes shall go forwarde.
{10:6} And if ye blowe the alarme the second tyme, the hoast that lyeth on the south side shall take their iourney: for they shall blowe an alarme when they take their iourneyes.
{10:7} But when the congregation is to be gathered together, they shall blowe without an alarme.
{10:8} And the sonnes of Aaron the priestes shall blowe with their trumpettes, and ye shall haue them as a lawe for euer in your generations.
{10:9} And if ye go to warre in your lande agaynst your enemies that vexe you, ye shall blowe an alarme with the trumpettes, and ye shalbe remembred before the Lorde your God, to be saued from your enemies.
{10:10} Also in the day of your gladnesse, and in your feast dayes, & in the begynnyng of your monethes, ye shall blowe the trumpettes ouer your burnt sacrifices and peace offerynges, that they may be a remembraunce for you before your God: I am the Lorde your God.
{10:11} And it came to passe the twentith day of the seconde moneth in the seconde yere, that the cloude was taken vp from of the tabernacle of the testimonie.
{10:12} And the children of Israel toke their iourney out of the desert of Sinai, and the cloude rested in the wildernesse of Pharan.
{10:13} And they first toke their iourney at the mouth of the Lorde by the hande of Moyses.
{10:14} In the first place went the standerde of the hoast of the children of Iuda accordyng to their armies: whose captayne was Nahasson the sonne of Aminadab.
{10:15} And ouer the hoast of the tribe of the children of Isachar, was Nathanael the sonne of Zuar.
{10:16} And ouer the hoast of the tribe of the chyldren of Zabulon, was Eliab the sonne of Helon.
{10:17} And the tabernacle was take downe, and the sonnes of Gerson and Merari went foorth bearing the tabernacle.
{10:18} And the hoast of Ruben went foorth with their standerd and armies, whose captaine was Elizur ye sonne of Sedeur.
{10:19} And ouer the hoast of the tribe of the chyldren of Simeon, was Salamiel the sonne of Suri Saddai.
{10:20} And ouer the hoast of the tribe of the chyldren of Gad, was Eliasaph the sonne of Duel.
{10:21} The Caathites also went forwarde and bare the sanctuarie, & the other dyd set vp the tabernacle against they came.
{10:22} And the standerd of the hoast of the chyldren of Ephraim went foorth accordyng to their armies, whose captayne was Elisama the sonne of Ammiud.
{10:23} And ouer the hoast of the tribe of the sonnes of Manasse, was Gamaliel the sonne of Pedazur.
{10:24} And ouer the hoast of the tribe of the sonnes of Beniamin, was Abidan the sonne of Gedeon.
{10:25} And the standerd of the hoast of the children of Dan came foorth (gathering all the hoastes together) throughout their armies, whose captaine was Ahiezer the sonne of Ammi Saddai.
{10:26} And ouer the hoast of the tribe of the chyldren of Aser, was Pagiel the sonne of Ochran.
{10:27} And ouer the hoast of the tribe of the chyldren of Nephthali, was Ahira the sonne of Enan.
{10:28} These are the iourneys of the chyldren of Israel throughout their armies, and thus the hoastes remoued.
{10:29} And Moyses sayde vnto Hobab the sonne of Raguel the Madiamte, which was Moyses father in lawe: We go vnto the place of whiche the Lorde sayde, I wyll geue it you. Come thou therefore with vs, and we wyll do thee good: for the Lorde hath promised good vnto Israel.
{10:30} And he aunswered hym: I wyll not go, but wyl depart to mine owne lande, and to my kinred.
{10:31} He said: Oh nay, leaue vs not, for thou knowest our mansions in the wyldernesse, and thou mayest be to vs in steade of eyes.
{10:32} And if thou go with vs, looke what goodnesse the Lorde sheweth vnto vs, the same wyll we shewe vnto thee.
{10:33} And they departed from the mount of the Lorde three dayes iourney, and the arke of the couenaunt of the Lorde went before them in ye three dayes iourney, to search out a resting place for the.
{10:34} And the cloude of the Lorde was vppon them by day, when they went out of the campe.
{10:35} And when ye arke went foorth, Moyses sayde: Rise vp Lorde, and let thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate thee, flee before thee.
{10:36} And when the arke rested, he sayde: Returne O Lord, vnto the many thousandes of Israel.
{11:1} And when the people dyd wickedly, it was a displeasure in the eares of the Lorde: And when the Lorde hearde it, his countenaunce was prouoked to wrath, and the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and consumed them that were the vttermost of the hoast.
{11:2} And the people cryed vnto Moyses: And when Moyses made intercession vnto the Lorde, the fire quenched.
{11:3} And he called the name of the place Taberah, because the fire of the Lorde burnt among them.
{11:4} And a number of people that was among them fell a lustyng, and turned them selues, and wept (euen as dyd also the chyldren of Israel) and sayd: who shall geue vs fleshe to eate?
{11:5} We remember the fishe which we did eate in Egypt for naught, & the cucumbers, & melons, leekes, onions & garleck.
{11:6} But now our soule is dryed away: for we can see nothing els, saue Manna.
{11:7} The Manna was as coriander seede, and to see to lyke Bedellion.
{11:8} And the people went about and gathered it, & grounde it in milles, or beat it in morters, and baked it in pannes, and made cakes of it: And the taste of it, was lyke vnto the taste of freshe oyle.
{11:9} And when the deawe fell downe vpon the hoast in the nyght, the Manna fell vpon it.
{11:10} And when Moyses hearde the people weepe throughout their housholdes, euery man in the doore of his tent, the wrath of the Lord was kindeled exceedingly, and it greeued Moyses also.
{11:11} And Moyses sayde vnto the Lorde: Wherefore hast thou dealt cruelly with thy seruaunt? And wherefore haue I not founde fauour in thy sight, seyng that thou puttest the wayght of all this people vpon me?
{11:12} Haue I conceaued all this people? Or haue I begotten them, that thou shouldest say vnto me, Cary them in thy bosome as a nurse beareth the suckyng chylde, vnto the lande which thou swarest vnto their fathers?
{11:13} Where shoulde I haue fleshe to geue vnto all this people, whiche weepe before me, saying: Geue vs fleshe that we may eate.
{11:14} I am not able to beare all this people alone, seyng it is to heauie for me.
{11:15} If thou deale thus with me, kyll me I pray thee, if I haue founde fauour in thy sight, yt I see not my wretchednesse.
{11:16} And the Lorde sayde vnto Moyses: Gather vnto me threscore and ten men of the elders of Israel, which thou knowest that they are the elders of the people & officers ouer them: and thou shalt bryng them vnto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stande there with thee:
{11:17} And I wyll come downe, and talke with thee there, and take of the spirite which is vpon thee, and put vpon them, and they shall beare the burthen of the people with thee, lest thou be constrayned to beare it alone.
{11:18} And say thou vnto the people, Be halowed agaynst to morowe, and ye shall eate fleshe: for your whyning is in the eares of the Lorde, seyng ye sayd, Who shall geue vs fleshe to eate? we were happy in Egypt: Therefore the Lorde wyll geue you fleshe, and ye shall eate.
{11:19} Ye shall not eate one day nor two, nor fiue dayes, neither ten, nor twentie dayes:
{11:20} But euen a moneth long, vntill it come out at the nostrels of you, and it shalbe lothsome vnto you, because that ye haue cast the Lorde aside whiche is among you, and haue wept before hym, saying: Why came we thus out of Egypt?
{11:21} And Moyses sayde: Sixe hundred thousand footemen are there of the people, among which I am: And thou hast sayd, I wyll geue them flesh, that they may eate a moneth long.
{11:22} Shall the sheepe & the oxen be slayne for them, to finde them? either shall all the fishe of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffise them?
{11:23} And the Lorde sayde vnto Moyses: Shall the Lordes hande be waxed short? Thou shalt see now whether my word shal come to passe vnto thee or not.
{11:24} And Moyses went out, and tolde the people the saying of the Lorde: and gathered the threscore and ten elders of the people, and set them rounde about the tabernacle.
{11:25} And the Lord came downe in a cloude, and spake vnto him, and toke of the spirite that was vpon him, and gaue it vnto the threscore & ten elders: And when the spirite rested vpon them, they prophesied, and dyd not ceasse.
{11:26} But there remayned two of the men in the hoast, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: And the spirite rested vpon them, (and thei were of them that were written, and went not out vnto the tabernacle) and they prophesied in the hoast.
{11:27} And there ran a young man, and tolde Moyses, and sayd: Eldad and Medad do prophesie in the hoast.
{11:28} And Iosuah the sonne of Nun the seruaunt of Moyses, one of his young men aunswered, and sayde: My lorde Moyses, forbyd them.
{11:29} And Moyses sayd vnto hym: Enuiest thou for my sake? woulde God that all the Lordes people could prophesie, and that the Lorde woulde put his spirite vpon them.
{11:30} And Moyses gate hym into the hoast, he and the elders of Israel.
{11:31} And there went foorth a wynde from the Lorde, and brought quayles from the sea, & let them fall about the hoast, euen a dayes iourney rounde about on euery side of the hoast, and they did flee in the ayre as it were two cubites hye ouer the earth.
{11:32} And the people stoode vp all that day, and all that nyght, and all the next day, and they gathered quayles: And he that gathered litle, gathered ten homers ful: And they spread them abrode for their vse, rounde about the hoast.
{11:33} And whyle the fleshe was yet betweene their teeth, & yer it was chewed vp, the wrath of the Lorde was kindled against the people, & the Lorde smote the people with an exceedyng great plague.
{11:34} And he called the name of the place, The graues of lust: because the buried the people that lusted there.
{11:35} And the people toke their iourney from the graues of lust vnto Hazeroth, and abode at Hazeroth.
{12:1} And Miriam and Aaron spake agaynst Moyses, because of the women of Ethiopia whiche he had taken: for he had take to wife one of Ethiopia.
{12:2} And they sayde: Hath the Lorde in deede spoken onlye through Moyses? Hath he not spoken also by vs? And the Lorde hearde it.
{12:3} (But Moyses was a very meeke man, aboue all the men of the earth.)
{12:4} And the Lorde spake at once vnto Moyses, vnto Aaron, and to Miriam: Come out ye three vnto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they came out all three.
{12:5} And the Lorde came downe in the pyller of the cloude, and stoode in the doore of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam. And they went out both of them.
{12:6} And he sayde, Heare my wordes: If there be a prophete of the Lordes among you, I wyll be knowen of him in a vision, and wyll speake vnto hym in a dreame.
{12:7} My seruaunt Moyses is not so, which is faythfull in all myne house.
{12:8} Unto hym wyll I speake mouth to mouth in a vision, not in darke speaches and similitudes of the Lord shall he see: Wherfore then were ye not afrayde to speake against my seruaunt Moyses?
{12:9} And the Lord was moued vnto wrath agaynst them, and he went his way.
{12:10} And the cloude departed from the tabernacle, and beholde Miriam was become leprous, as it were snowe: And Aaron looked vpon Miriam, and beholde, she was leprous.
{12:11} And Aaron saide vnto Moyses: Alas my Lorde, I beseche thee put not the sinne vpon vs whiche we haue foolishlye committed and sinned.
{12:12} Oh, let her not be as one dead, of who the fleshe is halfe consumed when he commeth out of his mothers whom.
{12:13} And Moyses cryed vnto the Lorde, saying: Heale her nowe, O God, I beseche thee.
{12:14} And ye Lorde sayde vnto Moyses: If her father had spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seue dayes? Let her be shut out of the hoast seuen dayes, and after that, let her be receaued in againe.
{12:15} And Miriam was shut out of the hoast seuen dayes: and the people remoued not, tyll she was brought in agayne.
{12:16} And afterwarde the people remoued from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wyldernesse of Pharan.
{13:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses saying:
{13:2} Sende men out to searche the lande of Chanaan, whiche I geue vnto the chyldren of Israel: of euery tribe of their fathers shall ye sende a man, and let them all be suche as are rulers among them.
{13:3} And Moyses at the commaundement of the Lorde, sent foorth out of the wyldernesse of Pharan, suche men as were all heades of the chyldren of Israel.
{13:4} Their names are these. Of the tribe of Ruben, Sammua the sonne of Zacur.
{13:5} Of the tribe of Simeon, Saphat the sonne of Hori.
{13:6} Of the tribe of Iuda, Caleb the sonne of Iephune.
{13:7} Of the tribe of Isachar, Igal the sonne of Ioseph.
{13:8} Of the tribe of Ephraim, Osea the sonne of Nun.
{13:9} Of the tribe of Beniamin, Palti the sonne of Raphu.
{13:10} Of the tribe of Zabulon, Gaddiel the sonne of Sodi.
{13:11} Of the tribe of Ioseph, namely of the tribe of Manasse, Gaddi the sonne of Susi.
{13:12} Of the tribe of Dan, Amiel the sonne of Gemalli.
{13:13} Of the tribe of Aser, Sethur the sonne of Michael.
{13:14} Of the tribe of Nephthali, Nahabi the sonne of Uaphsi.
{13:15} Of the tribe of Gad, Guel the sonne of Machi.
{13:16} These are the names of the men which Moyses sent to spie out the land: And Moyses called the name of Osea the sonne of Nun, Iosuah.
{13:17} And Moyses sent them foorth to spie out the lande of Chanaan, and said vnto them: Get you vp this way southward, that ye may go vp into the hie countrey,
{13:18} And see the lande what maner thing it is, and the people that dwelleth therin, whether they be strong or weake, eyther fewe or many:
{13:19} And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad, and what maner of cities they be that they dwell in, whether they dwell in tentes or walled townes:
{13:20} And what maner of lande that is, whether it be fat or leane, and whether there be trees therin or not. Be of good courage, and bryng of the fruite of the lande: And it was about the tyme that grapes are first rype.
{13:21} And so they went vp, and searched out the lande from the wildernesse of Zin, vnto Rehob, as men come to Hemath.
{13:22} And they ascended vnto the south, and come vnto Hebron, where Ahiman was and Sesai, and Thalmai, the sonnes of Anac. Hebron was buylt seuen yeres before Zoan in Egypt.
{13:23} And they came vnto the ryuer of Escol, and cut downe there a braunch with one clouster of grapes, and twayne bare it vpon a staffe: and they brought also of the pomgranates, and of the figges.
{13:24} And the place was called the riuer Escol, because of ye cluster of grapes whiche the children of Israel cut downe thence.
{13:25} And they turned backe agayne from searching of ye lande after fourtie dayes.
{13:26} And they went, and came to Moyses and Aaron, and vnto all the multitude of the chyldren of Israel in the wyldernesse Pharan to Cades, and brought them worde, and also vnto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruite of the lande.
{13:27} And they tolde hym, and sayde: we came vnto the lande whyther thou sendedst vs & surely it floweth with milke and hony, and here is of the fruite of it.
{13:28} Neuerthelesse, the people be strong that dwell in the lande, and the cities are walled and exceedyng great: and moreouer, we sawe the chyldren of Anac there.
{13:29} The Amalechites dwell in the south countrey: and the Hethites, and the Iebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountaynes: & the Chanaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Iordane.
{13:30} And Caleb stylled the people before Moyses, saying: Let vs go vp at once, and possesse it, for we be able to ouercome it.
{13:31} But the men that went vp with him, sayde: We be not able to go vp agaynst the people, for they are stronger then we.
{13:32} And they brought vp an euyll report of the lande whiche they had searched, saying vnto the children of Israel: The lande whiche we haue gone through to searche it out, is a lande that eateth vp the inhabitours therof, and the people that we sawe in it, are men of a great stature.
{13:33} And there we sawe also giauntes the chyldren of Anac whiche come of the giauntes: And we seemed in our sight as it were grashoppers, and so we dyd in their sight.
{14:1} And all the multitude of the people cried out, and wept throughout that nyght.
{14:2} And all the chyldren of Israel murmured agaynst Moyses and Aaron, and the whole congregation sayde vnto them: Woulde God that we had dyed in the lande of Egypt, either that we had dyed in this wyldernesse.
{14:3} Wherfore hath the Lorde brought vs vnto this lande to fall vpon the sworde, and that our wyues and our chyldren should be a pray? Were it not better that we returne vnto Egypt agayne?
{14:4} And they sayd one to another: Let vs make a captayne, and returne vnto Egypt agayne.
{14:5} Then Moyses & Aaron fell on their faces before all the assemblie of the congregation of the chyldren of Israel.
{14:6} And Iosuah the sonne of Nun, and Caleb the sonne of Iephune whiche were of them that searched the lande, rent their clothes:
{14:7} And spake vnto al the companie of the chyldren of Israel, saying: The lande whiche we walked through to searche it, is a very good lande.
{14:8} If the Lord haue a loue to vs, he will bryng vs into this lande and geue it vs, whiche is such a lande as floweth with mylke and hony.
{14:9} But in any wyse rebell not ye agaynst the Lorde, neither feare the people of the lande, for they are but bread for vs: Their shielde is departed from them, and the Lorde is with vs, feare them not therfore.
{14:10} But all the congregation bade stone them with stones: And the glory of the Lorde appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the chyldren of Israel.
{14:11} And the Lorde sayde vnto Moyses: Howe long do this people prouoke me, and how long wyll it be yer they beleue me, for all the signes which I haue shewed among them?
{14:12} I will smyte them with the pestilence and destroy them, and wyll make of thee a greater nation and mightier then they.
{14:13} And Moyses sayde vnto the Lorde: Then the Egyptians shall heare it, (for thou broughtest this people in thy might from among them.)
{14:14} And it wylbe tolde to the inhabiters of this lande also: for they haue hearde lykewyse, that thou Lorde art among this people, and that thou Lorde art seene face to face, and that thy cloude standeth ouer them, & that thou goest before them by day tyme in a pyller of a cloude, and in a pyller of fire by nyght.
{14:15} If thou shalt kyll all this people as they were but one man: then the nations whiche haue hearde the fame of thee, wyll say:
{14:16} Because the Lord is not able to bryng in this people into the lande whiche he sware vnto them, therefore he hath slaine them in the wyldernesse.
{14:17} And nowe I beseche thee, let the power of my Lord be great, accordyng as thou hast spoken, saying:
{14:18} The Lorde is long yer he be angrie, and of great mercy, and suffreth iniquitie and sinne, and leaueth no man innocent, and visiteth the vnrighteousnesse of the fathers vpon the chyldren, in the thirde and fourth generations.
{14:19} Be mercyfull I beseche thee vnto the sinne of this people accordyng vnto thy great mercy, as thou hast forgeuen this people from Egypt, euen vntyll nowe.
{14:20} And the Lorde sayde: I haue forgeuen it, according to thy request.
{14:21} But as truely as I liue, all the earth shalbe filled with the glory of the Lord.
{14:22} But all those men whiche haue seene my glory, and my miracles whiche I did in Egypt and in the wildernesse, and haue tempted me nowe this ten tymes, and haue not hearkened vnto my voyce:
{14:23} Shall not see the lande whiche I sware vnto their fathers, neither shall any of them that prouoked me see it.
{14:24} But my seruaunt Caleb, because he had another maner of spirite, (and because he hath folowed me vnto the vtmost) hym wyll I bryng into the lande which he hath walked in, and his seede shall inherite it.
{14:25} And also the Amalechites and Chanaanites, remayne in the valley: To morowe turne you, and get you into the wyldernesse, euen by the way of the red sea.
{14:26} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses and Aaron, saying:
{14:27} Howe long doth this euyll multitude murmure agaynst me? I haue hearde the murmuringes of the children of Israel with the whiche they murmure agaynst me.
{14:28} Tell them therefore: As truely as I liue sayeth the Lorde, I wyll do vnto you euen as ye haue spoken in myne eares:
{14:29} Your carkasses shall fall in the wyldernesse: And all you that were tolde throughout your numbers from twentie yeres and aboue, whiche haue murmured against me,
{14:30} Shall not come into the lande ouer which I lifted vp myne hand to make you dwell therin, saue Caleb the sonne of Iephune, and Iosuah the sonne of Nun.
{14:31} But your chyldren whiche ye sayde shoulde be a pray, them I wyll bryng in, and they shall knowe the lande whiche ye haue refused.
{14:32} And your carkasses shall fall in this wyldernesse.
{14:33} And your chyldren shall wander in the wildernesse fourtie yeres, and suffer for your whordome, vntyll your carkasses be wasted in the wyldernesse.
{14:34} After the number of the dayes in whiche ye searched out the lande, euen fourtie dayes, euery day for a yere shal ye beare your vnrighteousnesse, euen fourtie yeres, and ye shall knowe my breache of promise.
{14:35} I the Lorde haue sayde, that I wyll do it vnto all this euyll congregation that are gathered together against me: For in this wildernesse they shalbe consumed, and there they shall dye.
{14:36} And the men whiche Moyses sent to searche the lande, and whiche (when they came agayne) made all the people to murmure against hym, and brought vp a sclaunder vpon the lande:
{14:37} Euen those men that dyd bryng vp that sclaunder vpon it as though it had ben euill, dyed in a great plague before the Lorde.
{14:38} But Iosuah the sonne of Nun, and Caleb the sonne of Iephune, whiche were of the men that went to searche the lande, liued styll.
{14:39} And Moyses tolde these sayinges vnto all the chyldren of Israel, and the people toke great sorowe.
{14:40} And they rose vp early in the morning, and gate them vp into the toppe of the mountayne, saying: lo, we be here, and wyll go vp vnto the place of which the Lorde sayde: For we haue sinned.
{14:41} And Moyses sayde: Wherfore transgresse ye thus the worde of the Lorde? it wyll not come well to passe.
{14:42} Go not vp therefore, for the Lorde is not among you: that ye be not slayne before your enemies.
{14:43} For the Amalechites and the Chanaanites are there before you, & ye wyll fall vpon the sworde, because ye are turned away from the Lorde, & the Lorde wyll not be with you.
{14:44} But they presumed obstinatly to go vp into the hyll top: Neuerthelater, the arke of the couenaunt of the Lorde and Moyses, departed not out of the hoast.
{14:45} Then the Amalechites and the Chanaanites which dwelt in that hill, came downe, and smote them, and consumed them euen anto Horma.
{15:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{15:2} Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them: when ye be come into the lande of your habitations, whiche I geue vnto you:
{15:3} And will make an offering by fire vnto the Lorde, namely a burnt offering, or a sacrifice to fulfill a vowe, or a free offering, or in your principall feastes, to make a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde, of the heard, or of the flocke:
{15:4} Then let hym that offereth his offering vnto the Lord, bryng also a meate offering of a tenth deale of floure, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oyle.
{15:5} And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drinke offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering, or any other offering, for one lambe.
{15:6} Or if it be a ramme, thou shalt prepare for a meate offering two tenth deales of floure, mingled with the thirde part of an hin of oyle.
{15:7} And for a drinke offering, thou shalt offer the thirde part of an hin of wine, for a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde.
{15:8} And when thou preparest a bullocke for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice to fulfill a vowe or peace offering vnto the Lorde:
{15:9} Let him bring with a bullocke a meate offering of three tenth deales of floure, mingled with halfe an hin of oyle.
{15:10} And thou shalt bryng for a drinke offering, euen halfe an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire of a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde.
{15:11} After this maner shall it be done for a bullocke, or for a ramme, or for a lambe, or a kid,
{15:12} According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to euery one, accordyng to their number.
{15:13} All that are borne of the countrey, shal do these thynges after this maner, to offer an offering made by fire of a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde.
{15:14} And if a straunger soiourne with you, or whosoeuer be among you in your generations, and wyll offer an offering made by fire of a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde: euen as ye do, so he shall do.
{15:15} One ordinaunce shalbe both for you of the cogregation, and also for the straunger that dwelleth with you: It shalbe an ordinaunce for euer in your generations: as ye are, so shall the straunger be before the Lorde.
{15:16} One lawe and one maner shall serue, both for you, and for the straunger that soiourneth with you.
{15:17} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{15:18} Speake vnto the chyldren of Israel, and say vnto them: When ye be come into the land to the which I bring you,
{15:19} Then when ye wyll eate of the bread of the lande, ye shall offer vp an heaue offering vnto the Lorde.
{15:20} Ye shall offer vp a cake of the first of your dowe for an heaue offering: as ye do the heaue offering of the barne, euen so ye shall heaue it.
{15:21} Of the first of your dowe ye shall geue vnto the Lorde an heaue offering in your generations.
{15:22} And if ye haue erred, and obserue not all these commaundementes which the Lorde hath spoken vnto Moyses,
{15:23} Euen all that the Lorde hath commaunded you by the hande of Moyses, from the first day that the Lorde commaunded Moyses, and hence forwarde among your generations.
{15:24} Yf ought be committed ignorauntly of the congregation, al the multitude shall offer a bullocke for a burnt offering, to be a sweete sauour vnto the Lord, with the meate offering and drinke offering therto accordyng to the maner, and an hee goate for a sinne offering.
{15:25} And the priest shall make an attonement for all the multitude of the chyldren of Israel, and it shalbe forgeuen them, for it is ignoraunce: And they shal bryng their offering, a sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord, & their sinne offering before the Lorde for their ignoraunce.
{15:26} And it shalbe forgeuen vnto all the congregation of the chyldren of Israel, and vnto the straunger that dwelleth among you, seyng all the people were in ignoraunce.
{15:27} If any one soule sinne through ignoraunce, he shall bryng a shee goate of a yere olde for a sinne offering.
{15:28} And the priest shall make an attonement for the soule that sinneth ignorauntly, when he sinneth by ignoraunce before the Lorde to reconcile hym, and that it may be forgeuen hym.
{15:29} And both thou that art borne of the chyldren of Israel, and the strannger that dwelleth among you, shall haue one lawe who so doth sinne thorowe ignoraunce.
{15:30} But the soule that doth ought presumptuously, whether he be borne in the lande or a straunger, the same blasphemeth the Lorde: and that soule shalbe cut of from among his people.
{15:31} Because he hath despised the worde of the Lorde, and hath broken his commaundement, that soule therefore shalbe vtterly cut of, and his sinne shalbe vppon hym.
{15:32} And whyle the chyldre of Israel were in the wyldernesse, they founde a man that gathered stickes vpon the Sabbath day.
{15:33} And they that founde hym gathering stickes, brought hym vnto Moyses and Aaron, and vnto all the congregation.
{15:34} And they put hym in warde, seyng it was not declared what shoulde be done to hym.
{15:35} And the Lorde sayde vnto Moyses: Let the man dye, & let all the multitude stone him with stones without ye hoast.
{15:36} And all the multitude brought hym without the hoast, and stoned hym with stones, and he dyed, as the Lorde commaunded Moyses.
{15:37} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{15:38} Speake vnto the chyldren of Israel, and byd them, that they make them fringes in the borders of their garmentes throughout their generations, and put vpon the fringe of the borders a ribande of blewe silke.
{15:39} And the fringe shalbe vnto you to loke vpon, that ye may remember all the comaundementes of the Lorde, and do them: and that ye seeke not after your owne heart, or your owne eyes, after the which ye vse to go a whoryng.
{15:40} But ye shall remember rather, and do all my commaundementes, and be holy vnto your God.
{15:41} I am the Lorde your God, which brought you out of the lande of Egypt, for to be your God: I am the Lorde your God. The rebellion of Corah, Dathan, and Abiram. 31 They perishe with their companie.
{16:1} And Corah the sonne of Isaar, the sonne of Caath, the sonne of Leui, went a part with Dathan and Abiram, the sonnes of Eliab, & On the sonne of Peleth, the sonne of Ruben:
{16:2} And they rose vp before Moyses, with certayne of the children of Israel, two hundred & fiftie, which were captaynes of the multitude, famous in the congregation, and men of renoune.
{16:3} And they gathered them selues together agaynst Moyses and Aaron, and sayde vnto them: Ye take much vpon you, seyng all the multitude are holy euery one of them, and the Lorde is among them: Why lyft you your selues vp aboue the congregation of the Lord?
{16:4} And when Moyses hearde it, he fell vpon his face,
{16:5} And spake vnto Corah and vnto all his company, saying: Tomorowe the Lord wyll shewe who are his, who is holy, and who ought to approche nye vnto hym: and whom he hath chosen, he will cause to come neare vnto hym.
{16:6} This do therfore: Take you firepannes, both Corah & all his companie,
{16:7} And do fire therin, and put incense in them before the Lorde to morowe: And the man whom the Lorde doth chose, the same shalbe holy: Ye take much vpon you ye sonnes of Leui.
{16:8} And Moyses sayd vnto Corah: Heare I pray you, ye sonnes of Leui,
{16:9} Seemeth it but a small thyng vnto you, that the God of Israel hath seperated you from the multitude of Israel, and brought you to hym selfe, to do the seruice of the tabernacle of the Lorde, and to stande before the multitude, and to minister vnto them?
{16:10} He hath taken thee to hym, and all thy brethren the sonnes of Leui with thee: and seeke ye the office of the priest also?
{16:11} For which cause both thou and all thy companie are gathered together against the Lorde: And what is Aaron, that ye murmure agaynst hym?
{16:12} And Moyses sent, and called Dathan and Abiram the sonnes of Eliab: which sayde, We wyll not come vp.
{16:13} Is it a small thyng, that thou hast brought vs out of the land that floweth with mylke and honie, to kyll vs in the wildernesse: except thou make thy selfe lorde and ruler ouer vs also?
{16:14} Moreouer, thou hast not brought vs vnto a lande that floweth with mylke & honie, neither geuen vs inheritaunce of fieldes and vineyardes: Wylt thou put out the eyes of these men? We wyll not come vp.
{16:15} And Moyses waxed very angry, and sayde vnto the Lorde, Turne not thou vnto their offeryng: I haue not taken so much as an asse from them, neither haue I hurt any of them.
{16:16} And Moyses sayde vnto Corah: Be thou & al thy company before the Lord, both thou, they, and Aaron, to morowe.
{16:17} And take euery man his censer, and put incense in them, and bryng ye before the Lorde euery man his censer, euen two hundreth and fiftie censers: thou also and Aaron, euery one his censer.
{16:18} And they toke euery man his censer, and put fire in them, and layde incense theron, and stoode in the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moyses and Aaron.
{16:19} And Corah gathered all the congregation agaynst them, vnto the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation: And the glorie of the Lorde appeared vnto all the congregation.
{16:20} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses and Aaron, saying:
{16:21} Seperate your selues from among this congregation, that I may consume them at once.
{16:22} And they fell vpon their faces, and sayde: O God, the God of spirites of all fleshe, hath not one man sinned? Wilt thou be wroth with all the multitude?
{16:23} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{16:24} Speake vnto the congregation, and say: Get you away from about the tabernacle of Corah, Dathan, & Abiram.
{16:25} And Moyses rose vp, and went vnto Dathan and Abiram: and the elders of Israel folowed hym.
{16:26} And he spake vnto the congregation, saying: Depart I pray you from the tentes of these wicked men, and touche nothyng of theirs, lest ye perishe in all their sinnes.
{16:27} And so they gate them from the tabernacle of Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, on euery syde: And Dathan & Abiram came out, & stoode in the doore of their tentes, with their wiues, their sonnes, and their litle children.
{16:28} And Moyses sayde: Hereby ye shall knowe that the Lorde hath sent me to do all these workes, for I haue not done them of myne owne mynde.
{16:29} If these men dye the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men, then the Lorde hath not sent me:
{16:30} But and if the Lorde make a newe thyng, and the earth open her mouth, and swallowe them vp with all that they haue, and they go downe quicke into the pit: then ye shall vnderstande that these men haue prouoked ye Lorde.
{16:31} And assoone as he had made an ende of speaking al these wordes, the ground cloue asunder that was vnder them:
{16:32} And the earth opened her mouth, and swalowed them vp, and their houses, and all the men that were with Corah, and all their goodes.
{16:33} And they and all that they had went downe alyue vnto the pit, and the earth closed vpon them: and they perished from among the congregation.
{16:34} And all Israel that were about them, fled at the crye of them: And they sayde, lest the earth swalowe vs vp also.
{16:35} And there came out a fire from the Lorde, and consumed the two hundred and fiftie men that offered incense.
{16:36} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{16:37} Speake vnto Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the priest, that he take vp the censers out of the burnyng, and scatter the fire here and there, for they are halowed,
{16:38} The censers of these sinners agaynst their owne soules: let them make of them brode plates for a coueryng of the aulter: For they offered them before the Lorde, and therfore they are halowed, and they shalbe a signe vnto the children of Israel.
{16:39} And Eleazar the priest toke the brasen censers, which they that were burnt had offered, and made brode plates for a coueryng of the aulter,
{16:40} To be a remembraunce vnto the children of Israel, that no straunger which is not of the seede of Aaron, come neare to offer incense before the Lorde, that he be not lyke vnto Corah and his companie, as the Lorde sayde to hym by the hande of Moyses.
{16:41} But on the morowe, all the multitude of the children of Israel murmured agaynst Moyses and Aaron, saying: Ye haue kylled the people of the Lorde.
{16:42} And whe the multitude was gathered agaynst Moyses and Aaron, they loked towarde the tabernacle of the congregation: And beholde, the cloude couered it, and the glorie of the Lorde appeared.
{16:43} And Moyses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.
{16:44} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{16:45} Get you from among this congregation, that I may consume the quickly. And they fell vpon their faces.
{16:46} And Moyses sayd vnto Aaron: Take a censer, and put fire therin out of the aulter, and powre on incense, and go quickly vnto the congregation, & make an attonement for them: For there is wrath gone out from the Lorde, and there is a plague begunne.
{16:47} And Aaron toke as Moyses comaunded hym, and ranne into the middes of ye congregation: and beholde, the plague was begunne among the people, and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
{16:48} And whe he stoode betweene the dead and them that were alyue, the plague was stayed.
{16:49} They that dyed in the plague, were fourteene thousand and seuen hundred, besyde them that dyed about the conspiracie of Corah.
{16:50} And Aaron went againe vnto Moyses before the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the plague was stayed.
{17:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{17:2} Speake vnto the children of Israel, and take of euery one of them a rodde, after the houses of their fathers, of all their princes accordyng to the familie of their fathers, euen twelue roddes: and write euery mans name vpon his rodde.
{17:3} And write Aarons name vpon the rodde of Leui: for euery rodde shalbe for ye head of the house of their fathers.
{17:4} And put them in the tabernacle of the congregation, before the arke of the testimonie, where I wyll declare my selfe vnto you.
{17:5} And the mans rodde whom I chose, shall blossome: And I wyll make ceasse from me the grudgynges of the children of Israel, wherby they grudge agaynst you.
{17:6} And Moyses spake vnto the children of Israel, and all the princes gaue hym a rodde, one rodde for euery prince, accordyng to their fathers houses, euen twelue roddes: and the rodde of Aaron was among their roddes.
{17:7} And Moyses put the roddes before the Lorde in the tabernacle of witnesse.
{17:8} And on the morowe, Moyses went into the tabernacle of witnesse: and beholde, the rodde of Aaron for the house of Leui was budded, and brought foorth buddes, bare blossomes, and rype almondes.
{17:9} And Moyses brought out all ye roddes from before the Lorde, vnto all the children of Israel: and they loked vpon them, and toke euery man his rodde.
{17:10} And the Lorde sayde vnto Moyses: Bryng Aarons rodde agayne before the witnesse, to be kept for a token to the rebellious children, and that their murmuryng may cease from me, and that they dye not.
{17:11} And Moyses dyd as the Lorde commaunded hym, euen so dyd he.
{17:12} And the children of Israel spake vnto Moyses, saying: Beholde, we are wasted away and perished, we all come to naught.
{17:13} Whosoeuer cometh nye, or approcheth to the tabernacle of the Lord, shall dye: Shall we vtterly consume away, and dye?
{18:1} And the Lorde sayde vnto Aaron: Thou & thy sonnes, and thy fathers house with thee, shal beare the iniquitie of the sanctuarie: And thou and thy sonnes with thee, shall beare the iniquitie of your priestes office.
{18:2} And thy brethren of the tribe of Leui, & of thy fathers householde thou shalt bryng with thee, that they may be ioyned vnto thee, and minister vnto thee: but thou and thy sonnes with thee shal minister before the tabernacle of witnesse.
{18:3} They shall kepe thy charge, euen the charge of all the tabernacle: only let them not come nye the vessels of the sanctuarie and the aulter, that they and ye also dye not.
{18:4} And they shalbe ioyned with thee, and kepe the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation for all the seruice of the tabernacle: and let no straunger come nye vnto you.
{18:5} Therfore shall ye kepe the charge of the sanctuarie, and the charge of the aulter, that there fall no more wrath vpon the children of Israel:
{18:6} Beholde, I haue taken your brethren the Leuites from among the children of Israel, which as a gyft of yours are geuen vnto the Lorde, to do the seruice of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{18:7} Therfore shalt thou & thy sonnes with thee kepe your priestes office for all thynges that pertayne vnto the aulter and within the vayle: And ye shal serue, for I haue geue your priestes office vnto you as a gift, and therfore ye straunger that commeth nye, must be slayne.
{18:8} And the Lorde spake vnto Aaron: Beholde, I haue geuen thee the keping of myne heaue offerynges, of all the halowed thynges of the children of Israel euen vnto thee I haue geuen the for the annoyntyng, and to thy sonnes for an ordinaunce for euer.
{18:9} This shalbe thyne of the most holy thynges reserued from the fire of the aulter. All their sacrifices for all their meate offerynges, sinne offerynges, or trespasse offerynges, which they bryng vnto me, that shalbe most holy vnto thee, and to thy sonnes.
{18:10} In the most holy place shalt thou eate it, and all that are males shall eate of it, let it be holy vnto thee.
{18:11} And this also is thyne: the heaue offerynges of their gyftes, throughout all the waue offerynges of the children of Israel: I haue geuen them vnto thee, & thy sonnes and thy daughters with thee, to be a dutie for euer: and all that are cleane in thy house, shall eate of it.
{18:12} Al the fat of the oyle, & al the fat of the wine, & of the wheate, which they shall offer vnto the Lorde for first fruites, the same haue I geuen vnto thee.
{18:13} And whatsoeuer is first rype in their lande which they bryng vnto the Lord, shalbe thyne, and all that are cleane in thyne house, shall eate of it.
{18:14} All thinges seperate from the common vse in Israel, shalbe thyne.
{18:15} All that breaketh the matrice in all fleshe that men bryng vnto the Lorde, whether it be of men or beastes, shalbe thyne: Neuerthelater, the first borne of man shalt thou redeeme, & the first borne of vncleane beastes shalt thou redeeme.
{18:16} Those that are to be redeemed, shalt thou redeeme from ye age of a moneth, accordyng to thyne estimation, for the money of fiue sicles, after the sicle of the sanctuarie, which is twentie gerahs.
{18:17} But the first borne of a cowe, sheepe, & goate, shalt thou not redeeme, for they are holy: therfore thou shalt sprinckle their blood vpon the aulter, and shalt burne their fat as a sacrifice made by fire, for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord.
{18:18} And the fleshe of them is thyne, as the waue brest and the right shoulder: these are thyne.
{18:19} All the heaue offerynges of holy thynges which the children of Israel offer vnto the Lord, haue I geuen thee & thy sonnes and thy daughters with thee, to be a duetie for euer: let it be a salted couenaut for euer before ye Lord, both vnto thee, & to thy seede with thee.
{18:20} And ye Lord spake vnto Aaron: Thou shalt haue no inheritauce in their lande, neither shalt thou haue any part amog them: I am thy part & thy inheritaunce among the children of Israel.
{18:21} Beholde, I haue geuen the children of Leui all the tenth in Israel to inherite, for the seruice which they serue in the tabernacle of the congregation.
{18:22} Neither must the children of Israel hencefoorth come nie ye tabernacle of the congregation, lest they beare sinne, & die.
{18:23} But the Leuites shal do ye seruice in the tabernacle of the congregation, & beare their sinne: It shalbe a lawe for euer in your generations, that among ye childre of Israel they possesse no inheritaunce.
{18:24} But the tithes of the childre of Israel which they pay as an heaue offeryng vnto the Lord, I haue geuen ye Leuites to inherite: and therfore I haue sayde vnto them, Among the children of Israel ye shall possesse no inheritaunce.
{18:25} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{18:26} Speake vnto the Leuites, and say vnto them: When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I haue geuen you of the for your inheritaunce, ye shal take an heaue offering of ye same for the Lorde, euen the tenth part of that tithe.
{18:27} And this your heaue offeryng shalbe reckened vnto you, euen as though it were of the corne of the barne, or as the fulnesse of the wine presse.
{18:28} Of this maner ye shall therfore offer an heaue offeryng vnto the Lorde, of all your tithes which ye receaue of the children of Israel, and ye shall geue therof the Lordes heaue offeryng to Aaron the priest.
{18:29} Of all your giftes ye shall offer all the Lordes heaue offeryng, euen all the fat of the same, to wit the holy thynges therof.
{18:30} Therfore thou shalt say vnto them: when ye haue taken away the fat of it from it, it shalbe counted vnto the Leuites, as if it were ye increase of the corne floore, or the increase of the winepresse.
{18:31} And ye shall eate it in all places, both ye and your householdes, for it is your rewarde for your seruice in the tabernacle of the congregation.
{18:32} And ye shall beare no sinne by the reason of it, when ye haue offered from it the fat of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy thynges of the children of Israel, lest ye dye.
{19:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses & Aaron, saying:
{19:2} This is the ordinaunce of the lawe which the Lord hath commaunded, saying: Speake vnto the children of Israel that they bring thee a redde cowe without spot, and wherin is no blemishe, and vpon which neuer came yoke.
{19:3} And ye shall geue her vnto Eleazar the priest, that he may bryng her without the hoast, and cause her to be slayne before his face:
{19:4} And let Eleazar the priest take of her blood with his finger, and sprinckle it directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seuen tymes.
{19:5} And cause the cowe to be burnt in his sight, with her skinne, fleshe, & blood: and the doung of her shal he burne also.
{19:6} And let the priest take Cedar wood, and hysope, and scarlet lase and cast it in the middes of the burnyng of the cowe.
{19:7} Then let the priest washe his clothes, and he shall bathe his fleshe in water, and then come into the hoast, and the priest shalbe vncleane vntyll the euen.
{19:8} And he that burneth her shall washe his clothes in water, & bathe his fleshe in water, and be vncleane vntyll euen.
{19:9} And a man that is cleane, shall gather vp the asshes of the cowe, and lay them without the hoast in a cleane place, and it shalbe kept for the multitude of the children of Israel for a water of seperation: It is a sinne offeryng.
{19:10} Therfore he that gathereth the asshes of the cowe, shall washe his clothes, and remayne vncleane vntill euen: And it shalbe vnto the children of Israel, and vnto the strauger that dwelleth among them, a statute for euer.
{19:11} He that toucheth the dead body of any man, shalbe vncleane seuen dayes.
{19:12} And he shall purifie hym selfe with this water the thirde day, & the seuenth day he shalbe cleane: But if he purifie not hym selfe the thirde day, then the seuenth day he shall not be cleane.
{19:13} Whosoeuer toucheth the dead coarse of any man that is dead, & purgeth not hym selfe, defileth the tabernacle of the Lorde, and that soule shalbe cut of from Israel, because the water of seperation was not sprinckled vpon hym: he shalbe therfore vncleane, his vncleanesse is yet vpon hym.
{19:14} This is the lawe of a man that dyeth in a tent: All that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shalbe vncleane seuen dayes.
{19:15} And all the vessels that be open, which haue no coueryng bounde vpon them, shalbe vncleane.
{19:16} And whosoeuer toucheth one that is slayne with a sworde in the fieldes, or a dead person, or a bone of a dead man, or a graue, shalbe vncleane seuen dayes.
{19:17} Therfore, for an vncleane person they shal take of the burnt asshes of the sinne offeryng, and runnyng water shalbe put therto in a vessell.
{19:18} And let a cleane person take hysope, & dippe it in the water, and sprinckle it vpon the tent, and vpon all the vessels, and on the persons that were therin, and vpon hym that touched a bone, or a slaine person, or a dead body, or a graue.
{19:19} And the cleane person shall sprinckle vpon the vncleane the thirde day and the seuenth day: And the seuenth day he shall purifie hym selfe, and washe his clothes, & bathe hym selfe in water, and shalbe cleane at euen.
{19:20} But the man that is vncleane, and purifieth not him selfe, the same soule shalbe cut of from among the congregation: because he hath defiled the sanctuarie of the Lorde, and the water of seperation hath not ben sprinckled vpon hym, therfore shall he remayne vncleane.
{19:21} And it shalbe a perpetuall lawe vnto them, that he that sprinckleth the water of seperation, shall washe his clothes: and he that toucheth the water of seperation, shalbe vncleane vntyll euen.
{19:22} And whatsoeuer the vncleane person toucheth, shalbe vncleane: And the soule that toucheth the thyng that was touched of the vncleane person shalbe vncleane vntyll euen.
{20:1} And the children of Israel came with the whole multitude into the desert of Zin in the first moneth, and the people abode at Cades: And there died Miriam, and was buryed there.
{20:2} But there was no water for the multitude: and they gathered them selues together agaynst Moyses and Aaron.
{20:3} And the people chode with Moyses, and spake, saying: Woulde God that we had perished when our brethren dyed before the Lorde.
{20:4} Why haue ye brought the congregation of the Lorde into this wildernesse, that both we and our cattell shoulde dye in it?
{20:5} Wherfore haue ye made vs to come vp out of Egypt, to bryng vs into this euyll place, which is no place of seede, nor of fygges, nor vines, nor pomgranates, neither is there any water to drynke?
{20:6} And Moyses and Aaron went from the presence of the congregation, vnto the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation, and fel vpon their faces, and the glorie of the Lorde appeared vnto them.
{20:7} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{20:8} Take the rodde, and gather thou and thy brother Aaron the congregation together, and speake vnto the rocke before their eyes, and it shall geue foorth his water: And thou shalt bryng them water out of the rocke, to geue the companie drynke, and their beastes also.
{20:9} And Moyses toke the rodde from before the Lord, as he commaunded hym.
{20:10} And Moyses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rocke, and Moyses sayde vnto them: Heare ye rebelles, must we fetch you water out of this rocke?
{20:11} And Moyses lyft vp his hande, and with his rodde he smote the rocke two tymes, and the water came out aboundauntly, and the multitude dranke, and their beastes also.
{20:12} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses and Aaron: Because ye beleued me not, to sanctifie me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therfore ye shall not bryng this congregation into the lande which I haue geuen them.
{20:13} This is the water of strife, because the children of Israel stroue with ye Lorde, and he was sanctified in them.
{20:14} And Moyses sent messengers from Cades vnto the kyng of Edom, thus sayeth thy brother Israel: Thou knowest all the trauayle that we haue had.
{20:15} Our fathers went downe into Egypt, & we haue dwelt in Egypt a long tyme: and the Egyptians vexed vs and our fathers.
{20:16} And when we cryed vnto the Lorde, he hearde our voyce, and sent an angell, and hath set vs vp out of Egypt: And beholde, we are in Cades, euen in the vttermost citie of thy border.
{20:17} Let vs passe I pray thee through thy countrey: but we wyll not go through the fieldes or vineyardes, neither wyll we drynke of the water of the fountaynes: we wyll go by the kynges hye way, and neither turne vnto the ryght hande nor to the left, vntyll we be past thy borders.
{20:18} And Edom aunswered hym: Thou shalt not go by me, lest I come out agaynst thee with the sworde.
{20:19} The children of Israel sayd vnto him, we wyll go by the beaten way: and if I and my cattell drynke of thy water, I wyll pay for it: I wyll but only (without any harme) go through on my feete.
{20:20} He aunswered: Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out agaynst hym with much people, and with a mightie power.
{20:21} And thus Edom denied to geue Israel passage through his countrey: wherfore Israel turned away from hym.
{20:22} And the children of Israel departed from Cades, and came vnto mount Hor, with all the congregation.
{20:23} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses and Aaron in mount Hor, harde by the coast of the lande of Edom, saying.
{20:24} Aaron shalbe gathered vnto his people: for he shall not come into the lande which I haue geuen vnto the children of Israel, because ye disobeyed my mouth at the water of strife.
{20:25} Take Aaron and Eleazar his sonne, and bryng them vp into mount Hor.
{20:26} And cause Aaron to put of his garmentes, and put them vpon Eleazar his sonne: and Aaron shalbe gathered vnto his people, and shall dye there.
{20:27} And Moyses dyd as the Lorde commaunded: and they went vp into mount Hor, in the sight of all the multitude.
{20:28} And Moyses toke of Aarons clothes, and put them vpon Eleazar his sonne, and Aaron dyed there in the toppe of the mount: And Moyses and Eleazar came downe out of the mount.
{20:29} When all ye multitude sawe that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaro thirtie dayes, all the housholde of Israel.
{21:1} And when kyng Arad the Chananite which dwelt towarde the south, hearde tell that Israel came by the way that the spyes had founde out, he fought agaynst Israel, and toke some of them prisoners.
{21:2} And Israel vowed a vowe vnto the Lorde, and sayde: If thou wylt deliuer this people into my hande, I wyll vtterly destroy their cities.
{21:3} And the Lorde hearde the voyce of Israel, and deliuered them the Chanaanites: And they destroyed them and their cities, and called the name of the place Horma.
{21:4} And they departed fro mount Hor, by the way of the red sea, to compasse the lande of Edom: and the soule of the people was sore greeued, because of ye way.
{21:5} And the people spake agaynst God and agaynst Moyses: wherefore haue ye brought vs out of Egypt, for to dye in the wildernesse? for here is neither bread nor water, and our soule lotheth this lyght bread.
{21:6} Wherfore the Lorde sent fierie serpentes among the people, which stong them: and much people of Israel dyed.
{21:7} Therfore the people came to Moyses, & sayd: We haue sinned, for we haue spoken agaynst the Lord and agaynst thee: make intercession to the Lord that he take away the serpentes from vs. And Moyses made intercession for ye people:
{21:8} And the Lorde sayde vnto Moyses: Make thee a fierie serpent, and set it vp vpon a pole: that as many as are bitten may loke vpon it, and lyue.
{21:9} And Moyses made a serpent of brasse, and set it vpon a pole: and when the serpent had bitten any man, he behelde the serpent of brasse, and lyued.
{21:10} And the children of Israel departed thence, and pitched in Oboth.
{21:11} And they departed from Oboth, and pitched at the heapes of Abarim, euen in the wildernesse which is before Moab, on the east syde.
{21:12} And they remoued thence, and pitched vpon the riuer of Zared.
{21:13} And they departed thence, and pitched on the other syde of Arnon, which is in the wildernesse, and commeth out of the coastes of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, betweene Moab and the Amorites.
{21:14} Wherfore, it shalbe spoken in the booke of the warres of the Lord, what thyng he dyd in the red sea, and in the riuers of Arnon,
{21:15} And at the streame of the riuers, that goeth downe to the dwellyng of Ar, and lyeth vpon the border of Moab.
{21:16} From thence they returned vnto Beer: The same is the well wherof the Lord spake vnto Moyses: Gather the people together, and I will geue them water.
{21:17} Then Israel sang this song: Spryng vp well, syng ye vnto it:
{21:18} The princes digged this well, the captaynes of the people digged it with the lawe geuer, and with their staues. And from the wildernesse they went to Mathana:
{21:19} And from Mathana to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
{21:20} And from Bamoth of the valley that is in the fielde of Moab, vnto the top of the hyll that loketh towarde Iesimon.
{21:21} And Israel sent messengers vnto Sehon kyng of the Amorites, saying:
{21:22} Let me passe through thy lande, we wyll not turne into the fieldes or vineyardes, neither drynke of the waters of the well: but we wyll go along by the kynges hye way, vntyll we be past thy countrey.
{21:23} But Sehon woulde geue Israel no lisence to passe through his countrey: but gathered all his people together, & went out agaynst Israel into the wildernesse: And he came to Iaza, and fought agaynst Israel.
{21:24} And Israel smote him in the edge of the sworde, & conquered his lande from Arnon vnto Iabok, vnto the children of Ammon: For the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
{21:25} And Israel toke all these cities, and dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites in Hesbon, and in all the townes that long therto.
{21:26} For Hesbon was the citie of Sehon the kyng of the Amorites, which fought before agaynst ye kyng of the Moabites, and toke all his lande out of his hande, euen vnto Arnon.
{21:27} Wherfore they that speake in prouerbes, say: Come to Hesbon, and let the citie of Sehon be built and repayred.
{21:28} For there is a fire gone out of Hesbon, and a flambe from the citie of Sehon, and hath consumed Ar in Moab, and the lordes of Bamoth in Arnon.
{21:29} Wo to thee Moab, O people of Chamos ye are vndone: he hath suffered his sonnes to be pursued, & his daughters to be in captiuitie vnto Sehon the kyng of the Amorites.
{21:30} Their empire is lost from Hesbon vnto Dibon, and we made a wildernesse euen vnto Nopha, which reacheth vnto Medaba.
{21:31} And thus Israel dwelt in the lande of the Amorites.
{21:32} And Moyses sent to searche out Iaezer, and they toke the townes belonging therto, & rooted out the Amorites that were therein.
{21:33} And they turned, and went vp towarde Basan: And Og the kyng of Basan came out agaynst them, he and all his people to fight at Edrai.
{21:34} And the Lorde sayde vnto Moyses: feare hym not, for I haue deliuered hym into thy hande, and all his people and his lande, and thou shalt do to him as thou diddest vnto Schon the king of the Amorites whiche dwelt at Hesbon.
{21:35} They smote hym therefore, and his sonnes, and all his people, vntyll there was nothyng left hym, and they conquered his lande.
{22:1} And the children of Israel departed and pitched in the fieldes of Moab, on the other side of Iordane from Iericho.
{22:2} And Balac the sonne of Ziphor, sawe all that Israel had done to ye Amorites.
{22:3} And the Moabites were sore afrayde of the people, because they were many, and they were stroken with feare of the chyldren of Israel.
{22:4} And Moab sayde vnto the elders of Madian: Nowe shall this companie lycke vp all that are rounde about vs, as an oxe licketh vp the grasse of ye fielde. And Balac the sonne of Ziphor, was kyng of the Moabites at that tyme.
{22:5} He sent messengers therefore vnto Balaam the sonne of Beor to Pethor, which is by the riuer of the lande of the chyldren of his folke, to call him, saying: Beholde, there is a people come out of Egypt, and beholde they couer the face of the earth, & dwell ouer against me.
{22:6} Come nowe therfore I pray thee, and curse me this people, for they are to mightie for me, so peraduenture I myght be able to smyte them, & to driue them out of the lande: For I wote that he whom thou blessest, is blessed, and whom thou cursest is cursed.
{22:7} And the elders of Moab, and the elders of Madian departed, hauyng the rewarde of the southsaying in their hande: And they came vnto Balaam, and tolde hym the wordes of Balac.
{22:8} He aunswered them: Tary here this nyght, and I wyll bryng you worde, euen as the Lorde shall say vnto me. And the lordes of Moab abode with Balaam.
{22:9} And God came vnto Balaam, and sayd: What men are these with thee?
{22:10} And Balaam sayd vnto God: Balac the sonne of Ziphor kyng of Moab hath sent vnto me saying:
{22:11} Beholde, there is a people come out of Egypt, and couereth the face of the earth: Come nowe therefore, and curse them for my sake, if so peraduenture I may be able to ouercome them in battayle, and to dryue them out.
{22:12} And God said vnto Balaam: Go not thou with them, neither curse the people: for they are blessed.
{22:13} And Balaam rose vp in the mornyng, and sayd vnto the lordes of Balac, Get you vnto your lande: for the Lord wyll not suffer me to go with you.
{22:14} And the lordes of Moab rose vp, and went vnto Balac and sayde: Balaam would not come with vs.
{22:15} And Balac sent againe a greater companie of lordes, and more honourable then they.
{22:16} Whiche came to Balaam, and tolde hym, Thus sayeth Balac the sonne of Ziphor: Oh let nothyng let thee, but come vnto me:
{22:17} For I wyll greatly promote thee vnto great honour, and wyll do whatsoeuer thou sayest vnto me: come I pray thee, curse this people for my sake.
{22:18} And Balaam aunswered and said vnto the seruauntes of Balac: If Balac woulde geue me his house full of syluer and golde, I can not go beyonde the worde of the Lorde my God, to do lesse or more:
{22:19} Nowe therefore I pray thee, tarie ye here this nyght, that I may wit what the Lorde wyll say vnto me more.
{22:20} And God came vnto Balaam by night, and sayde vnto hym: If the men come to call thee, ryse vp and go with them: but loke what I say vnto thee, that shalt thou do.
{22:21} And Balaam rose vp early, and sadled his asse, & went with the lordes of Moab.
{22:22} And the wrath of God was kindled, because he went: And the angell of the Lorde stoode in the way to be agaynst hym, as he rode vpon his asse, and his two seruauntes were with hym.
{22:23} And when the asse sawe the angell of the Lord stand in the way, and hauyng his sworde drawen in his hand, the asse turned aside out of the way, and went out into the fielde: And Balaam smote the asse, to turne her into the way.
{22:24} But the angell of the Lorde stoode in a path betweene the vineyardes, and there was a wall on the one syde, and another on the other.
{22:25} And when the asse sawe the angell of the Lorde, she thrust her selfe vnto the wall, & crusht Balaams foote agaynst the wall: and he smote her agayne.
{22:26} And the angell of the Lord went further, & stoode in a narowe place, where was no way to turne either to the right hande, or to the left.
{22:27} And when the asse sawe the angell of the Lorde, she fell downe vnder Balaam: and Balaam was wroth, & smote the asse with a staffe.
{22:28} And the Lorde opened the mouth of the asse, and she sayde vnto Balaam: What haue I done vnto thee, that thou hast smytten me nowe three tymes?
{22:29} And Balaam sayd vnto the asse, Because thou hast mocked me: I would also there were a sworde in myne hande, for euen nowe woulde I kyll thee.
{22:30} And the asse sayd vnto Balaam: Am not I thine asse, whiche thou hast rydden vpon since the first tyme vnto this day? Was I euer wont to do so vnto thee? He sayde, nay.
{22:31} And the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, hauing his sworde drawen in his hande: He bowed hym selfe therefore, and fell flat on his face.
{22:32} And the angell of the Lorde said vnto him: Wherfore hast thou smytten thine asse these three times? Beholde, I came out to withstande thee, because thyne heart hath declined out of the way before me.
{22:33} And the asse saw me, and turned from me now three times: or els if she had not turned fro me, I had surely slayne thee, and saued her aliue.
{22:34} Balaam sayde vnto the angell of the Lorde: I haue sinned, for I wyst not that thou stoodest in the way agaynst me: Nowe therefore if it displease thee, I wyll turne home agayne.
{22:35} The angell of the Lorde sayde vnto Balaam, Go with the men: but what I say vnto thee, that shalt thou speake. And so Balaam went with the lordes of Balac.
{22:36} And when Balac heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meete hym, vnto a citie of Moab, whiche is in the border of Arnon, eue in the vtmost coast.
{22:37} And Balac sayd vnto Balaam: Dyd I not sende for thee to call thee? And wherfore camest thou not vnto me: Am I not able in deede to promote thee vnto honour?
{22:38} And Balaam made aunswere vnto Balac, Lo, I am come vnto thee, and can I nowe say any thyng at all? The worde that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speake.
{22:39} And Balaam went with Balac, and they came vnto a citie of streates.
{22:40} And Balac offered oxen and sheepe, and sent thereof to Balaam, and to the lordes that were with hym.
{22:41} And on the morowe Balac toke Balaam, and brought hym vp into the hye places of Baal, that thence he might see the vtmost part of the people.
{23:1} And Balaam said vnto Balac: Buylde me here seuen aulters, & prepare me here seuen oxen & seuen rammes.
{23:2} And Balac dyd as Balaam sayde: And Balac and Balaam offred on euery aulter an oxe and a ramme.
{23:3} And Balaam said vnto Balac: Stand by thy sacrifice, and I will go, if happly the Lorde will meete me: and whatsoeuer he sheweth me, I wyll tell thee. And he went vp hyer.
{23:4} But God met Balaam, & Balaam sayd vnto hym: I haue prepared seuen aulters, and haue offred vpon euery aulter an oxe and a ramme.
{23:5} And the Lorde put a saying in Balaams mouth, and sayde: Go agayne to Balac, and say on this wyse.
{23:6} And when he went agayne vnto him, lo, he stoode by his burnt sacrifice, he and all the lordes of Moab.
{23:7} And he toke vp his parable, and sayd: Balac the king of Moab hath brought me fro Mesopotamia, out of the mountaynes of the east, saying Come, curse Iacob for my sake, come and defie Israel.
{23:8} Howe shall I curse hym, whom God hath not cursed? or howe shall I defie hym, whom God hath not defied?
{23:9} For from the toppe of the rockes I see hym, and from the hylles I beholde hym: lo, the people shall dwell by them selues, and shal not be reckened among the nations.
{23:10} Who can tell the dust of Iacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? I pray God that my soule may dye the death of the righteous, and that my last ende may be like his.
{23:11} And Balac sayd vnto Balaam: What hast thou done vnto me? I toke thee to curse myne enemies, and beholde thou hast blessed them altogether.
{23:12} He aunswered and sayd: Must I not take heede to speake that whiche the lorde hath put in my mouth?
{23:13} And Balac sayde vnto hym: Come I pray thee with me vnto another place, whence thou mayest see them, and thou shalt see but the vtmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: curse them out of that place for my sake.
{23:14} And he brought hym into a fielde, where men myght see farre of, euen to the toppe of an hyll, and buylt seuen aulters, and offred an oxe and a ramme on euery aulter.
{23:15} And he said vnto Balac: Stande here by thy burnt sacrifice, whyle I meete the Lorde yonder.
{23:16} And the Lord met Balaam, and put a worde in his mouth, and sayd: Go agayne vnto Balac, and say thus.
{23:17} And when he came to hym, beholde he stoode by his burnt sacrifice, and the lordes of Moab with hym. And Balac saide vnto hym: What hath the Lorde sayde?
{23:18} And he toke vp his parable, and aunswered: Rise vp Balac, and heare, and hearke vnto me thou sonne of Ziphor.
{23:19} God is not a man that he should lye, neither the sonne of a ma that he should repent: should he say & not do? or should he speake, and not make it good?
{23:20} Beholde, I haue taken vpon me to blesse: for he hath blessed, and it is not in my power to aulter it.
{23:21} He behelde no vanitie in Iacob, nor saw transgression in Israel: The Lord his God is with hym, and the ioyfull shout of a king is among them.
{23:22} God brought them out of Egypt, they haue strength as an Unicorne.
{23:23} For there is no sorcerie in Iacob, nor soothsaying in Israel, according to this time it shalbe sayde of Iacob and Israel: What hath God wrought?
{23:24} Beholde, the people shall ryse vp as a Lion, and heaue vp him self as a young Lion: He shall not lye downe, vntyll he eate of the pray, and drinke the blood of them that are slayne.
{23:25} And Balac sayde vnto Balaam: Neither curse them, nor blesse them at all.
{23:26} But Balaam aunswered and said vnto Balac: Tolde not I thee, saying, All that ye Lorde speaketh, that I must do?
{23:27} And Balac said vnto Balaam: Come I pray thee, and I wyll bryng thee yet vnto another place, if at all it will please God, that thou mayst thence curse them for my sake.
{23:28} And Balac brought Balaam vnto the toppe of Peor, that looketh towarde Iesimon.
{23:29} And Balaam said vnto Balac: Make me here seuen aulters, and prepare me here seuen oxen, and seuen rammes.
{23:30} And Balac dyd as Balaam had sayd, and offered an oxe and a ramme on euerie aulter.
{24:1} And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lorde that he should blesse Israel, he went not as he dyd twise before to meete a soothsaying: but set his face towarde the wyldernesse.
{24:2} And Balaam lift vp his eyes, and loked vpon Israel as he lay accordyng to his tribes, and the spirite of God came vpon hym.
{24:3} And he toke vp his parable and sayd: Balaam the sonne of Beor hath sayde, and the man whose eyes is open hath sayde:
{24:4} He hath sayde whiche heareth the wordes of God, and seeth the visions of the almightie, and falleth downe with open eyes.
{24:5} Howe goodly are thy tentes O Iacob, and thyne habitations O Israel?
{24:6} Euen as the valleys are they layde abrode, & as gardens by the riuers side, as the tentes whiche the Lorde hath pitched, and as cypres trees beside the waters.
{24:7} The water droppeth out of his bucket, & his seede shalbe in many waters, and his king shalbe hier then Agag, and his kingdome shalbe exalted.
{24:8} God brought hym out of Egypt, his strength is as the Unicorne: He shall eate the nations his enemies, & gnawe their bones, and pearce them through with his arrowes.
{24:9} He couched hym selfe, and lay downe as a Lion, and as an elder Lion: who shall stirre hym vp? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.
{24:10} And Balac was wroth with Balaam, and smote his handes together, and Balac said vnto Balaam: I sent for thee to curse mine enemies, and behold thou hast blessed them this three tymes.
{24:11} Therfore nowe get thee quickly vnto thy place: I thought that I would promote thee vnto honour, but lo the Lord hath kept thee backe from worship.
{24:12} Balaam aunswered vnto Balac: Tolde I not thy messengers whiche thou sendedst vnto me, saying:
{24:13} If Balac woulde geue me his house full of siluer and golde, I can not passe the word of the Lord, to do either good or bad of mine owne minde: But what the Lorde sayeth, that wyll I speake.
{24:14} And nowe behold, I go vnto my people: Come therfore, and I wyll aduertise thee what this people shall do to thy folke in the latter dayes.
{24:15} And he toke vp his parable and sayd: Balaam the sonne of Beor hath sayde, the man whose eye is open, hath sayde:
{24:16} He hath said that heareth the wordes of God, and hath the knowledge of the most hygh, and beholdeth the vision of the almightie, and that falleth and his eyes are opened.
{24:17} I shall see him, but not nowe, I shall beholde him, but not nigh: There shall come a starre of Iacob, and ryse a scepter of Israel, & shall smyte the coastes of Moab, and vndermine all the chyldren of Seth.
{24:18} And Edom shalbe possessed, & Seir shall fall to the possession of their enemies, and Israel shall do manfully.
{24:19} Out of Iacob shall come he that shall haue dominion, and shall destroy the remnaunt of the citie.
{24:20} And when he loked on Amaleck, he toke vp his parable, and said: Amaleck is the first of the nations, but his latter ende shall perishe vtterly.
{24:21} And he loked on the Kenites, and toke vp his parable, and sayde: Strong is thy dwelling place, and thou puttest thy nest in a rocke.
{24:22} Neuerthelesse, the Kenite shalbe rooted out, vntyll Assur take thee prisoner.
{24:23} And he toke vp his parable, and sayd: Alas, who shall lyue when God doth this?
{24:24} The shippes also shall come out of the coast of Chittim, and subdue Assur, and subdue Eber, and he hym selfe shall perishe at the last.
{24:25} And Balaam rose vp, and went and returned to his place: and Balac also went his way.
{25:1} And Israel abode in Sittim, and the people began to commit whoredome with the daughters of Moab.
{25:2} Whiche called the people vnto the sacrifice of their gods: And the people dyd eate, and bowed downe to their gods.
{25:3} And Israel coupled hym selfe vnto Baal Peor, and the indignation of the Lorde was kindeled against Israel.
{25:4} And the Lorde sayde vnto Moyses: Take all the heades of the people, and hang them vp before the Lorde against the sunne, that the wrath of the Lordes countenaunce may be turned away from Israel.
{25:5} And Moyses sayde vnto the Iudges of Israel: Euery one slay his men that were ioyned vnto Baal Peor.
{25:6} And behold, one of the chyldren of Israel came & brought vnto his brethren a Madianitishe woman, euen in the sight of Moyses, and in the sight of all the multitude of the children of Israel, that wept before the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation.
{25:7} And when Phinehes the sonne of Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose vp out of the myddes of the companie, & toke a iauelin in his hande,
{25:8} And went after the man of Israel into the tent, & thrust them through both the man of Israel & also the woman, euen thorowe the belly of her: And the plague ceassed fro the chyldre of Israel.
{25:9} And there dyed in the plague twentie and foure thousande.
{25:10} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{25:11} Phinehes the sonne of Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the priest, hath turned myne anger away from the chyldren of Israel, whyle he was zelous for my sake among the, that I had not consumed the childre of Israel in my ielousie.
{25:12} Wherfore say: beholde, I geue vnto hym my couenaunt of peace.
{25:13} And he shall haue it, and his seede after hym, euen the couenaunt of the priestes office for euer, because he was zelous for his Gods sake, and made an attonement for the chyldren of Israel.
{25:14} The name of the Israelite thus kylled, which was slayne with the Madianitishe woman, was Zamri the sonne of Salu, a Lorde of an house and kinred of Simeon.
{25:15} And the name of the Madianitishe woma that was slayne, was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur, a head ouer the people of his fathers house in Madian.
{25:16} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{25:17} Uexe the Madianites, & smyte them:
{25:18} For they trouble you with their wyles, whiche haue begyled you by deceyte in the cause of Peor, & in the cause of their sister Cozbi, the daughter of a Lorde of the Madianites, whiche was slayne in the day of the plague for Peors sake.
{26:1} And after the plague, the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, and vnto Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the priest, saying:
{26:2} Take the number of al the multitude of the chyldren of Israel, from twentie yeres old and aboue, throughout their fathers houses, all that are able to go to warre in Israel.
{26:3} And Moyses and Eleazar the priest spake vnto them in the fieldes of Moab, by Iordan ouer against Iericho, saying:
{26:4} Ye shall number the people From twentie yeres & aboue, as the Lorde commaunded Moyses and the children of Israel, when they were come out of Egypt.
{26:5} Ruben the eldest sonne of Israel. The chyldren of Ruben: Hanoch, of whom commeth the kinred of the Hanochites: and Pallu, of whom commeth the kinred of the Palluites.
{26:6} Of Hesron, commeth the kinred of the Hesronites: of Charmi, commeth the kinred of the Charmites.
{26:7} These are the kinredes of the Rubenites, and they were in number fourtie and three thousand, seuen hundred and thirtie.
{26:8} And the sonnes of Pallu, Eliab.
{26:9} And the sonnes of Eliab, Nemuel, Dathan, & Abiram. This is that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation, and stroue against Moyses and Aaron in the company of Corah, when they stroue agaynst the Lorde.
{26:10} And the earth opened her mouth, & swalowed them vp: Corah also was in the death of that multitude, what tyme the fire consumed two hundred and fiftie men: and they became a signe.
{26:11} Notwithstanding, the chyldren of Corah dyed not.
{26:12} And the chyldren of Simeon after their kinredes, were Nemuel, of whom cometh the kinred of the Nemuelites: Iamin, of whom commeth the kinred of the Iaminites: Iachin, of whom commeth the kinred of the Iachinites.
{26:13} Of Zareh, commeth the kinred of the Zarehites: And of Saul, commeth the kinred of the Saulites.
{26:14} These are the kinredes of Simeon, euen twentie and two thousande and two hundred.
{26:15} The chyldren of Gad after their kinredes, were Zephon, of whom cometh the kinred of the Zephonites: Haggi, of whom commeth the kinred of the Haggites: Suni, of whom commeth the kinred of the Sunites.
{26:16} Of Ozui, commeth the kinred of the Oznites: and of Eri, commeth the kinred of the Erites.
{26:17} Of Arod, commeth the kinred of the Arodites: Of Ariel, commeth the kinred of the Arielites.
{26:18} These are the kinredes of the children of Gad, according to their numbers, fourtie thousande and fiue hundred.
{26:19} The children of Iuda, Er and Onan, and Er and Onan dyed in the lande of Chanaan.
{26:20} But the chyldren of Iuda after their kinredes, were Sela, of whom cometh the kinred of the Selanites: Phares, of whom commeth the kinred of the Pharezites: Zareh, of whom cometh the kinred of the Zarehites.
{26:21} And the children of Phares, were Hesron, of whom commeth the kinred of the Hesronites: Hamul, of whom commeth the kinred of the Hamulites.
{26:22} These are the kinredes of Iuda after their numbers, threscore and sixteene thousande and fiue hundred.

{26:54} To many thou shalt geue the more inheritaunce, and to fewe the lesse: to euerie tribe shall the inheritaunce be geuen, according to the number therof.

{26:62} And after their numbers, they were twentie and three thousande, all males from a moneth olde and aboue: For they were not numbred among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritaunce geuen them among the children of Israel.
{26:63} These are the numbers when Moyses and Eleazar the priest numbred the chyldren of Israel in the playne of Moab, fast by Iordane ouer agaynst Iericho.
{26:64} And among these there was not a man of them whom Moyses & Aaron numbred, when they tolde the chyldren of Israel in the wyldernesse of Sinai.
{26:65} For the Lorde sayde of them: They shall dye in the wyldernesse. And there was not left a man of them, saue Caleb the sonne of Iephune, and Iosuah the sonne of Nun.
{27:1} Then came the daughters of Zalphaad the sonne of Hepher, the sonne of Gilead, the sonne of Machir, the sonne of Manasse, of the kinred of Manasse the sonne of Ioseph: whose names were Maala, Noha, Hagla, Melcha and Thirza.
{27:2} And stode before Moyses and Eleazar the priest, and before the lordes, and all the multitude by the doore of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying:
{27:3} Our father dyed in the wyldernesse, and was not in the company of them that gathered them selues together agaynst the Lorde in the congregation of Corah: but dyed in his owne sinne, and had no sonnes.
{27:4} Wherefore then is the name of our father taken away from among his kinred, because he hath no sonne? Geue vnto vs therefore a possession among the brethren of our father.
{27:5} And Moyses brought their cause before the Lorde.
{27:6} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying.
{27:7} The daughters of Zalphaad speake ryght: thou shalt geue them a possession to inherite among their fathers brethren, and shalt turne the inheritaunce of their father vnto them.
{27:8} And thou shalt speake vnto the chyldren of Israel, saying: If a man dye and haue no sonne, ye shall turne his inheritaunce vnto his daughter.
{27:9} If he haue no daughter, ye shall geue his inheritaunce vnto his brethren.
{27:10} If he haue also no brethren, ye shall geue his inheritaunce vnto his fathers brethren.
{27:11} And if his father haue no brethren, ye shall geue his inheritaunce vnto hym that is next to him of his kinred, and he shall possesse it: And this shalbe vnto the chyldren of Israel a lawe of iudgement, as the Lorde hath commaunded Moyses.
{27:12} And the Lorde sayde vnto Moyses: Get thee vp into this mount Abarim, and beholde the lande whiche I haue geuen vnto the chyldren of Israel:
{27:13} And whe thou hast seene it, thou shalt be gathered vnto thy people also, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.
{27:14} For ye were disobedient vnto my mouth in the desert of Zin, in the stryfe of the congregation, neither dyd ye sanctifie me in the waters before their eyes: That is, the water of stryfe in Cades in the wyldernesse of Zin.
{27:15} And Moyses spake vnto the Lorde, saying:
{27:16} Let the Lord God of the spirites of all fleshe set a man ouer ye congregation,
{27:17} Which may go out & in before them, and leade them out and in, that the congregation of the Lord be not as sheepe which haue not a sheephearde.
{27:18} And the Lorde sayde vnto Moyses: Take thee Iosuah the sonne of Nun, a man in whom is the spirite, and put thyne handes vpon hym,
{27:19} And set hym before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation: and geue hym a charge in their sight.
{27:20} And put of thy prayse vpon him, that all the companie of the children of Israel may be obedient.
{27:21} And he shall stande before Eleazar the priest, which shall aske counsell for hym after the iudgement of Urim, before the Lorde: And accordyng vnto his worde, shall they go out and in, both he and all the children of Israel with him, and all the congregation.
{27:22} And Moyses dyd as the Lorde commaunded him: and he toke Iosuah, and set hym before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:
{27:23} And put his handes vpon hym, and gaue hym a charge, as the Lorde commaunded through the hand of Moyses.
{28:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{28:2} Commaunde the children of Israel, and say vnto them: My offeryng and my bread for my sacrifices which are made by fire for a sweete sauour, shal ye obserue to offer vnto me in their due season.
{28:3} And thou shalt say vnto them: This is the offeryng made by fire, which ye shall offer vnto the Lord: two lambes of a yere olde without spot, day by day for a continuall burnt offeryng.
{28:4} One lambe shalt thou prepare in the mornyng, and the other at euen.
{28:5} And therto the tenth part of an Epha of floure for a meate offeryng, mingled with the fourth part of an Hin of beaten oyle.
{28:6} It is a dayly burnt offeryng, such as was ordayned in the mount Sinai for a sweete sauour, a sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lorde.
{28:7} And let the drinke offering of the same be the fourth part of an Hin for one lambe, and in the holy place shalt thou commaunde the wine to be powred vnto the Lorde:
{28:8} And the other lambe thou shalt offer at euen, after the maner of the meate offeryng and the drynke offeryng of the mornyng, a sacrifice made by fire, shalt thou offer for a sweete sauour vnto the Lorde.
{28:9} And on the Sabbath day, two lambes of a yere olde without spot, and two tenth deales of floure for a meate offeryng mingled with oyle, and the drynke offeryng therto.

{29:39} These thynges ye shall do vnto the Lorde in your feastes, beside your vowes & freewil offeringes, your burnt offerynges, meate offerynges, drynke offerynges, and peace offerynges.
{29:40} And Moyses tolde the children of Israel, all that the Lord comaunded him.
{30:1} And Moyses spake vnto the heades of the tribes concernyng the children of Israel, saying: This is the thyng which the Lorde hath commaunded.
{30:2} If a man vowe vnto the Lorde, or sweare an othe to bynde his soule: he shall not go backe with his worde, but shall fulfyll all that is proceeded out of his mouth.
{30:3} If a woman also vowe a vowe vnto the Lorde, & bynde her selfe being in her fathers house in the tyme of her youth:
{30:4} And her father heare her vowe and bonde which she hath made vpon her soule, & holde his peace therto: then all her vowes and bondes which she hath made vpo her soule, shal stande in effect.
{30:5} But and if her father disalowe her the same day that he heareth al her vowes and bondes which she hath made vpon her soule: they shall not be of value, and the Lorde shall forgeue her, because her father disalowed her.
{30:6} If she had an husbande, when she vowed or pronounced ought out of her lippes, wherwith she bounde her soule:
{30:7} And her husbande hearde it, and helde his peace therat the same day he hearde it: then her vowes shall stande, and her bondes wherwith she bounde her soule, shall stande in effect.
{30:8} And if her husbande disalowe her the same day that he hearde it, then he shall make her vowe which she hath vpon her, and the openyng of her lippes wherwith she bounde her soule, of none effect, and the Lorde shall forgeue her.
{30:9} But euery vowe of a widowe, and of her that is deuorsed, that they haue bounde their soule withall, shall stande in effect with them.
{30:10} If she vowed in her husbandes house, or bounde her soule with an othe:
{30:11} And her husbande hearde it, and helde his peace concernyng her, & disalowed her not: then all her vowes shal stande, and euery bonde wherwith she bounde her soule, shall stande.
{30:12} But if her husbande disanulled them the same day yt he hearde them: then nothyng that proceedeth out of her lippes in vowes and bondes wherwith she bounde her soule, shall stande in effect: for her husbande hath disanulled them, and the Lorde shall forgeue her.
{30:13} All vowes and othes that binde to humble the soule, may her husbande stablishe or breake.
{30:14} But if her husbande holde his peace from one day to another, then he stablissheth all her vowes & bondes which she had vpon her: he confirmeth them, because he helde his peace concernyng her the same day that he hearde them.
{30:15} But if he breake them, after that he hath hearde them, he shall beare her sinne hym selfe.
{30:16} These are the ordinaunces which the Lord commaunded Moyses betweene a man and his wyfe, and betweene the father and his daughter, beyng yet a damsell in her fathers house.
{31:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{31:2} Auenge the children of Israel of the Madianites, & afterwarde shalt thou be gathered vnto thy people.
{31:3} And Moyses spake vnto the folke, saying: Harnesse some of you vnto warre, and let them go vpon the Madianites, & auenge the Lorde of the Madianites.
{31:4} Of euery tribe a thousande, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shal ye sende to the warre.
{31:5} And there were deliuered out of the thousandes of Israel, twelue thousand prepared vnto warre, of euery tribe a thousande.
{31:6} And Moyses sent the to ye warre, euen a thousande of euery tribe, & with them Phinees the sonne of Eleazar the priest to the warre, and the holy vessels, & the trumpets to blowe were in his hande.
{31:7} And they warred agaynst the Madianites as the Lord comaunded Moyses, and slue all the males.
{31:8} And they slue the kynges of Madian among other that were slayne: Namelye, Eui, and Rekem, Zur, & Hur, and Reba: fiue kynges of Madian, with Balaam the sonne of Beor, whom they slue with the sworde.
{31:9} And the children of Israel toke all the women of Madian prisoners, and their children, and spoyled all their cattel, and all their flockes, and all their goodes.
{31:10} And they burnt all their cities wherin they dwelt, and all their goodly dwellynges, with fire:
{31:11} And they toke all the spoyle, and all the bootie, both of men and beastes.
{31:12} And they brought the captiues, and that which they had taken, and the spoyle, vnto Moyses and Eleazar the priest, and vnto the companie of the children of Israel, euen vnto the hoast that were in the fieldes of Moab by Iordane, ouer agaynst Iericho:
{31:13} And Moyses and Eleazar the priest, and all the lordes of the congregation, went out of the hoast to meete them.
{31:14} And Moyses was angrie with the officers of the hoast, with the captaynes ouer thousandes, and ouer hundredes, which came from the warre & battayle.
{31:15} And Moyses sayde vnto them: Haue ye saued all the women alyue?
{31:16} Beholde, these caused the children of Israel through the councel of Balaam, to commit trespasse agaynst the Lorde in the businesse of Peor, and there folowed a plague among the congregation of the Lorde.
{31:17} Nowe therfore, slay all the men children, and kyl the women that haue lien with men fleshly.
{31:18} But all the women children that haue not lien with men carnally, kepe alyue for your selues.
{31:19} And ye shall remayne without the hoast seuen dayes, all that haue kylled any person, and all that haue touched any dead body, and purifie both your selues and your prisoners the thirde day and the seuenth.
{31:20} And purifie all your raymentes, and that is made of skinnes, and all worke of goates heere, and all thinges made of wood.
{31:21} And Eleazar the priest sayde vnto the men of warre which went to the battayle: This is the ordinauce of the lawe which the Lorde comaunded Moyses:
{31:22} As for golde, siluer, brasse, and iron, tinne, and lead,
{31:23} And all that may abide the fire, ye shal make it go through the fire, and it shalbe cleane: Neuerthelesse, it shalbe purified with water of seperation: And all that suffereth not the fire, ye shall make go through the water:
{31:24} And washe your clothes the seuenth day, and ye shalbe cleane, and afterwarde come into the hoast.
{31:25} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{31:26} Take the summe of the pray that was taken, both of the persons and of cattell, thou and Eleazar the priest, and the chiefe fathers of the congregation:
{31:27} And deuide the pray into two partes, betweene them that toke the warre vpon them and went out to battayle, and all the congregation.
{31:28} And take a tribute vnto the Lorde of the men of warre which went out to battayle: one soule of fiue hundred, both of the persons, and of the beefes, and of the asses, and of the sheepe.
{31:29} And ye shall take it of their halfe, and geue it vnto Eleazar the priest, as an heaue offeryng of the Lorde.
{31:30} And of the halfe of the children of Israel, thou shalt take one portion of fiftie, of the persons, and of the beefes, of the asses, and of the sheepe, and of al maner of beastes, and geue them vnto the Leuites which wayte vpon the charge of the tabernacle of the Lorde.
{31:31} And Moyses and Eleazar the priest, dyd as the Lorde comaunded Moyses.
{31:32} And the bootie, and the rest of the pray which the men of warre had caught, was sixe hundred thousande, and three sore and fifteene thousande sheepe,
{31:33} And three score and twelue thousande of beefes,
{31:34} And three score & one thousande asses,
{31:35} And thirtie & two thousande persons in all, of women that had lyen by no man.
{31:36} And the halfe, which was the part of them that went out to warre, was in number three hundred thousande, and seuen and thirtie thousande, & fiue hundred, sheepe.
{31:37} And the Lordes part of the sheepe, was sixe hundred & threescore & fifteene.
{31:38} And the beefes were thirtie and sixe thousande, of which the Lordes part was threescore and twelue.
{31:39} And the asses were thirtie thousande and fiue hundred, of which the Lordes part was threescore and one.

{31:41} And Moyses gaue the tribute, which was the Lordes heaue offeryng, vnto Eleazar the priest, as the Lorde commaunded Moyses:
{31:42} And the other halfe of the children of Israel which Moyses deuided from the men of warre,
{31:43} That is to wit the halfe that pertayned vnto the congregation, was three hundred thousande, and thirtie & seuen thousande, and fiue hundred, sheepe:
{31:44} And thirtie and sixe thousande beefes:
{31:45} And thirtie thousande asses, and fiue hundred:

{31:47} And Moyses toke of the halfe that pertayned vnto the children of Israel, one portion of fiftie, both of the persons and of the cattell, and gaue them vnto the Leuites which wayted vpon the charge of the tabernacle of the Lorde, as the Lorde commaundded Moyses.
{31:48} And the officers of thousandes of the hoast, ye captaynes ouer the thousandes, and the captaynes ouer the hundredes, came foorth,
{31:49} And sayde vnto Moyses: Thy seruauntes haue taken the summe of the men of warre which are vnder our aucthoritie, and there lacketh not one man of vs:
{31:50} We haue therfore brought a present vnto the Lord what euery man found, of iewels of golde, bracelets, chaynes, rynges, eare rynges, and spangles, to make an attonement for our soules before the Lorde.
{31:51} And Moyses and Eleazar the priest, toke the golde of them, all the wrought iewels.
{31:52} And all the golde of the heaue offering that they heaued vp to the Lorde, of the captaynes ouer thousandes & hundredes, was sixteene thousande, seuen hundred and fiftie sicles.
{31:53} (For the men of warre had spoyled, euery man for hym selfe.)
{31:54} And Moyses and Eleazar the priest toke the golde of the captaynes ouer the thousandes & hundredes, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memoriall of the children of Israel before the Lorde.
{32:1} The childre of Ruben & the chidren of Gad had an exeeding great multitude of cattell: And when they sawe the lande of Iazer, & the lande of Gilead, that it was an apt place for cattell,
{32:2} The children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, came & spake vnto Moyses and Eleazar the priest, and vnto the lordes of the congregation, saying:
{32:3} The lande of Ataroth & Dibon, Iazer and Nenrah, Hesbon and Elealeh, Sabam, and Nebo, and Beon:
{32:4} Which countrey the Lorde smote before the congregation of Israel, is a lande meete for cattell, and we thy seruauntes haue cattell.
{32:5} Wherfore said they: If we haue found grace in thy sight, let this lande be geue vnto thy seruauntes to possesse, & bryng vs not ouer Iordane.
{32:6} And Moyses sayde vnto the children of Gad and of Ruben: Shall your brethren go to warre, and ye shall sit here?
{32:7} Wherfore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel, that they shoulde not go ouer into the lande which the Lorde hath geuen them?
{32:8} Thus dyd your fathers when I sent them from Cades Brnea to see ye lande.
{32:9} For when they went vp euen vnto the riuer of Eschol, and sawe the lande, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the lande which the Lord hath geue them.
{32:10} And the Lordes wrath was kindled the same tyme, and he sware, saying:
{32:11} None of the men that came out of Egypt, fro twentie yeres olde & aboue, shall see the lande which I sware vnto Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, because they haue not wholly folowed me:
{32:12} Saue Caleb the sonne of Iephune the Kenesite, and Iosuah the sonne of Nun: for they haue constantly folowed the Lorde.
{32:13} And the Lorde was verie angry with Israel, and made them wander in the wildernesse fourtie yeres, vntyll all the generation that had done euyll in the sight of the Lorde, were consumed.
{32:14} And beholde, ye are rysen vp in your fathers steade, as an increase of sinfull men, to augment the fierce wrath of the Lorde towarde Israel:
{32:15} For if ye turne away from after hym, he wyll yet agayne leaue the people in the wildernesse, and ye shall destroy all this folke.
{32:16} And they went neare hym, and sayde: We wyll builde sheepe foldes here for our sheepe & for our cattell, and walled cities for our children:
{32:17} But we our selues wyl go redy armed before the children of Israel, vntyll we haue brought them vnto their place: And our children shall dwell in the fensed cities, because of the inhabiters of the lande.
{32:18} We wyll not returne vnto our houses, vntyll the children of Israel haue inherited, euery man his inheritaunce:
{32:19} Neither wyll we inherite with them on yonder side Iordane forwarde, because our inheritaunce is fallen to vs on this side Iordane eastwarde.
{32:20} And Moyses sayde vnto them: If ye wyll do this thyng, and go harnessed before the Lorde to warre,
{32:21} And will go all of you in harnesse ouer Iordane before the Lord, vntil he haue cast out his enemies from his sight,
{32:22} And vntyll the lande be subdued before the Lorde: then ye shall returne, and be without sinne before the Lorde and before Israel, and this lande shalbe your possession before the Lorde.
{32:23} But and if ye wyll not do so, beholde, ye haue sinned agaynst the Lorde: and be sure your sinne wyll finde you out.
{32:24} Nowe therfore, builde cities for your children, and foldes for your sheepe, and do that ye haue spoken.
{32:25} The children of Gad, and the children of Ruben, spake vnto Moyses, saying: Thy seruauntes wyll do as my Lorde commaundeth.
{32:26} Our children, our wyues, our sheepe, and our cattell, shall remayne here in the cities of Gilead:
{32:27} But thy seruauntes wyll go all harnessed for the warre, and vnto battayle before the Lorde, as my Lorde sayth.
{32:28} And for their sakes, Moyses commaunded Eleazar the priest, & Iosuah the sonne of Nun, and the chiefe fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel,
{32:29} And Moyses sayde vnto them: If the children of Gad, and the children of Ruben wyl go with you ouer Iordane, all armed, to fyght before the Lorde, then when the lande is subdued before you, ye shall geue them the lande of Gilead to possesse:
{32:30} But and if they wyll not go ouer with you in harnesse, they shall haue their possessions among you in the lande of Chanaan.
{32:31} And the children of Gad, and the children of Ruben, aunswered, saying: As the Lorde hath sayde vnto thy seruauntes, so wyll we do:
{32:32} We wyll go harnessed before ye Lorde into the lande of Chanaan, that the possession of our inheritaunce may be geuen vs on this side Iordane.
{32:33} And Moyses gaue vnto the children of Gad, and to the children of Ruben, and vnto halfe the tribe of Manasse the sonne of Ioseph, the kyngdome of Sehon kyng of the Amorites, and the kyngdome of Og kyng of Basan, the lande with the cities therof, in ye coastes and cities of the countrey rounde about.
{32:34} And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
{32:35} And Atoth, Sophan, Iaaser, and Iogbea,
{32:36} Bethnimra, and Betharan, fensed cities: & they built foldes for the sheepe.
{32:37} And the children of Ruben built Hesbon, Eleale, Kiriathaim,
{32:38} Nebo, Baalmeon, and turned their names, and Sibama also: and gaue other names vnto the cities which they builded.
{32:39} And the children of Machir the sonne of Manasse went to Gilead and toke it, and put out the Amorites that dwelt therin.
{32:40} And Moyses gaue Gilead vnto Mathir the sonne of Manasse, and he dwelt therin.
{32:41} And Iair the sonne of Manasse went and toke the smal townes therof, and called them Hauoth Iair.
{32:42} And Nobah went and toke Kenath, and the townes longyng therto, and called it Nobah, after his owne name.
{33:1} These are the iourneis of the children of Israel, which went out of the land of Egypt with their armies, vnder the hand of Moyses and Aaron.
{33:2} And Moyses wrote their goyng out by their iourneis, accordyng to the commaundement of the Lorde: euen these are the iourneis of their goyng out.
{33:3} They departed from Rameses the fifteene day of the first moneth, on the morowe after the Passouer: and the childre of Israel went out with an hie hande in the sight of the Egyptians.
{33:4} (For the Egyptians buryed all their first borne which the Lord had smitten among them, and vpon their gods also the Lorde dyd execution.)
{33:5} And the children of Israel remoued from Rameses, and pitched in Sucoth.
{33:6} And they departed from Sucoth, and pitched their tentes in Etham, which is in the edge of the wildernesse.
{33:7} And they remoued from Etham, and turned agayne vnto Pihairoth, which is before Baal Zephon: and they pitched before Migdol.
{33:8} And they departed from Pihairoth: and went through the middes of the sea into the wildernesse, and went three dayes iourney in the wildernesse of Etham, and pitched in Marah.
{33:9} And they remoued from Marah, and came vnto Elim, where were twelue fountaynes of water, and threescore & ten Palme trees, & they pitched there.
{33:10} And they remoued from Elim, and camped fast by the red sea.
{33:11} And they remoued from the red sea, and camped in the wildernesse of Zin.
{33:12} And they toke their iourney out of the wildernesse of Zin, and set vp their tentes in Daphka.
{33:13} And they departed from Daphka, and lay in Alus.
{33:14} And they remoued from Alus, and lay at Raphidim, where was no water for the people to drynke.
{33:15} And they departed from Raphidim, & pitched in the wildernesse of Sinai.
{33:16} And they remoued from the desert of Sinai, & pitched at the graues of lust.
{33:17} And they departed from ye sepulchres of lust, and lay at Hazeroth.

{33:32} And they remoued fro Bene Iaakan, and lay at Horgadgad.
{33:33} And they went from Horgadgad, and pitched in Iethebatha.
{33:34} And they remoued from Iethebatha, and lay at Abrona.
{33:35} And they departed from Abrona, and lay at Ezeon gaber.
{33:36} And they remoued from Ezeon gaber, and pitched in the wyldernesse of Sin, whiche is Cades.
{33:37} And they remoued from Cades, and pitched in mount Hor, whiche is in the edge of the lande of Edom.
{33:38} And Aaron the priest went vp into mount Hor at the commaundement of the Lorde, and dyed there, euen in the fourteeth yere after the chyldren of Israel were come out of ye lande of Egypt, and in the first day of the fifth moneth.
{33:39} And Aaron was an hundred and twentie and three yeres olde when he dyed in mount Hor.
{33:40} And king Erad the Chanaanite (which dwelt in the south in the lande of Chanaan) heard of the comming of the children of Israel:
{33:41} And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmona.
{33:42} And they departed from Zalmona, and pitched in Phunon.
{33:43} And they departed from Phunon, and pitched in Oboth.
{33:44} And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Iim abarim, in the border of Moab.
{33:45} And they departed from Iim abarim, and pitched in Dibon Gad.
{33:46} And they remoued from Dibon Gad, and lay in Almon Diblathaim.
{33:47} And they remoued from Almon Diblathaim, and pitched in the mountaines of Abarim before Nabo.
{33:48} And they departed from the mountaynes of Abarim, and pitched in the fieldes of Moab, fast by Iordane ouer against Iericho.
{33:49} And they pitched by Iordane, from Beth Iesimoth, vnto the playne of Sittim in the fieldes of Moab.
{33:50} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses in the fielde of Moab by Iordane ouer agaynst Iericho, saying:
{33:51} Speake vnto the chyldren of Israel, and say vnto them: When ye are come ouer Iordane to enter into the lande of Chanaan,
{33:52} Ye shall dryue out all the inhabiters of the lande before you, and destroy all their pictures, & breake a sunder al their images of mettall, and plucke downe all their hye places.
{33:53} And possesse the lande, and dwell therin: for I haue geuen you the lande to enioy it.
{33:54} And ye shall deuide the inheritaunce of the land by lot among your kinredes, and geue to the moe, the more inheritounce, and to the fewer, the lesse inheritaunce: And your inheritaunce shalbe in the tribes of your fathers, euery mans inheritaunce in the place where his lot falleth.
{33:55} But and if ye wyll not dryue out the inhabiters of the lande before you, then those whiche ye let remayne of them, shalbe prickes in your eyes, and dartes in your sides, and shall vexe you in the lande wherein ye dwell.
{33:56} Moreouer, it wyll come to passe, that I shall do vnto you, as I thought to do vnto them.
{34:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{34:2} Commaunde the children of Israel, and say vnto them: When ye come into the lande of Chanaan, this is the lande that shall fall vnto your inheritaunce, euen the lande of Chanaan with her coastes.
{34:3} And your south quarter shalbe from the wyldernesse Zin, along by the coast of Edom, so that your south quarter reache vpon the syde of the salt sea eastwarde.
{34:4} And fet a compasse from the south vp to Acrabim, and Recahe to Zinna: And go out fro the south to Cades Barnea, and go out also to Hazar Adar, and go along to Azmon.
{34:5} And fet a compasse agayne from Azmon, vnto the riuer of Egypt, and shall go out at the sea.
{34:6} And let your west quarter be the great sea, let the same sea be your west coast.
{34:7} And this shalbe your north quarter: ye shall compasse your border from the great sea, vnto mount Hor.
{34:8} And from mount Hor, ye shall describe your border, tyll it come vnto Hemath, & the end of the coast shalbe at Zedada.
{34:9} And the coast shall reache out to Ziphron, and go out at Hazar Enan: This shalbe your north quarter.
{34:10} And ye shall describe your east quarter from Hazar Enan to Sepham.
{34:11} And the coast shall go downe from Sepham to Ribla on the east syde of Ain: And the same border shall descend and go out at the side of the sea of Cenereth eastwarde.
{34:12} And then go downe along by Iordane, and leaue at the salt sea: And this shalbe your land, with the coastes therof rounde about.
{34:13} And Moyses commaunded the chyldren of Israel, saying: This is the land which ye shal inherite by lot, and which the Lorde commaunded to geue vnto nine tribes and an halfe.
{34:14} For the tribe of the chyldren of Ruben, according to the housholdes of their fathers, and the tribe of the chyldren of Gad accordyng to their fathers householdes, and halfe the tribe of Manasse, haue receaued their inheritaunce.
{34:15} Two tribes and an halfe haue receaued their inheritaunce on the other side of Iordane, ouer agaynst Iericho eastwarde.
{34:16} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{34:17} These are the names of the men which shall deuide the lande vnto you: Eleazar the priest, and Iosuah the sonne of Nun.
{34:18} And ye shall take also a Lorde of euery tribe, when ye deuide the lande.
{34:19} The names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Iuda, Caleb the sonne of Iephune.
{34:20} Of the tribe of the chyldren of Simeon, Semuel the sonne of Amiud.
{34:21} Of the tribe of Beniamin, Elidad the sonne of Cislon.
{34:22} Of the tribe of the chyldren of Dan, the lorde Bucki, the sonne of Iogli.
{34:23} From among the chyldren of Ioseph, for the tribe of the chyldren of Manasse, the lorde Haniel, the sonne of Ephod.
{34:24} Of the tribe of the childre of Ephraim, the lorde Camuel the sonne of Siphtan.
{34:25} Of the tribe of the sonnes of Zabulon, the lorde Elisaphan the sonne of Pharnach.
{34:26} Of the tribe of the chyldren of Isachar, the lorde Palthiel the sonne of Asan.
{34:27} Of the tribe of the sonnes of Aser, the lorde Ahihud the sonne of Salomi.
{34:28} Of the tribe of the chyldren of Nephthali, the lorde Pedael, the sonne of Ammihud.
{34:29} These are they whom the Lord commaunded to deuide the inheritaunce vnthe chyldren of Israel in the lande of Chanaan.
{35:1} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses in the fieldes of Moab by Iordane ouer against Iericho, saying:
{35:2} Commaunde ye chyldren of Israel, that they geue vnto the Leuites of the inheritaunce of their possession, cities to dwell in: And ye shal geue also vnto the cities of the Leuites, suburbes harde by their cities rounde about them.
{35:3} The cities shall they haue to dwell in, and the suburbes for their cattell, and for their possession, & al maner of beastes of theirs.
{35:4} And the suburbes of the cities whiche ye shall geue vnto the Leuites, shall reache from the wall of the citie outwarde, a thousande cubites rounde about.
{35:5} And ye shall measure without the citie of the east syde, two thousande cubites: and of the south syde, two thousande cubites: and of the west side, two thousand cubites: and of the north side, two thousande cubites also, and the citie shalbe in the middes: and these shalbe the suburbes of their cities.
{35:6} And from among the cities whiche ye shall geue vnto the Leuites, there shal be sixe cities for refuge, whiche ye shall appoynt to that intent that he whiche kylleth, may flee thyther: And to them ye shall adde fourtie and two cities mo.
{35:7} So that all the cities whiche ye shall geue the Leuites, may be fourtie and eyght, them shall ye geue with their suburbes.
{35:8} And these cities whiche ye shall geue, shalbe out of the possession of the chyldren of Israel. They that haue many, shall geue many: but of them that haue fewe, ye shall take fewe. Euery one shal geue of his cities vnto the Leuites, accordyng to the inheritaunce whiche he inheriteth.
{35:9} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses, saying:
{35:10} Speake vnto the chyldren of Israel, and say vnto them: When ye be come ouer Iordane into the lande of Chanaan:
{35:11} Ye shall appoint you cities, to be cities of refuge for you: that he whiche sleeth a person vnwares, may flee thyther.
{35:12} And these cities shalbe vnto you a refuge from the auenger of blood: that he which killeth, dye not, vntill he stand before the congregation in iudgement.
{35:13} And of these cities which ye shal geue, sixe cities shall ye haue for refuge.
{35:14} Ye shal geue three on this side Iordane, and three in the land of Chanaan, whiche shalbe cities of refuge.
{35:15} And these sixe cities shalbe a refuge, both for the chyldren of Israel, and for the straunger, & for hym that dwelleth among you: that all they whiche kyll any person vnwares, may flee thyther.
{35:16} And if any man smyte another with an instrument of iron that he dye, then is he a murtherer, and the murtherer shall dye for it.
{35:17} If he smyte hym with throwyng a stone, that a man may dye with, and if he dye, he that smote hym is a murtherer: let the same murtherer be slayne therefore.
{35:18} Or if he smyte hym with a handweapon of wood that a man may dye with, then if he dye, he is a murtherer: let the same murtherer be slaine therfore.
{35:19} The reuenger of blood him selfe shal slay the murtherer: when he meeteth hym, he shall slay hym.
{35:20} But if he thrust hym of hate, or hurle at hym by laying of wayte, that he dye,
{35:21} Or smyte hym with his hande of enmitie that he dye: he that smote hym shall dye the death, for he is a murtherer: the reuenger of the blood shall slay the murtherer when he meeteth hym.
{35:22} But if he pusshed hym vnaduisedly, and not of hate, or cast vpon hym any thing, and not in laying of wayte,
{35:23} Or any maner of stone that a man may dye with, and saw him not, and he caused it to fall vpon hym, and he dye, and was not his enemie, neither sought hym any harme:
{35:24} Then the congregation shal iudge betweene the slayer and the reuenger of blood, according to these lawes.
{35:25} And the congregation shall deliuer the slayer out of the hande of the reuenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore hym to the citie of his refuge, whyther he was fled: and he shal abide there vnto the death of the hye priest, whiche was annoynted with the holy oyle.
{35:26} But if the slayer come without the borders of his citie of refuge, whyther he was fled:
{35:27} And the reuenger of blood finde hym without the borders of the citie of his refuge, and the reuenger of blood kyll the slayer, he shalbe gyltlesse:
{35:28} Because he shoulde haue bydden in the towne of his refuge vntill the death of the hye priest; and after the death of the hye priest, the slayer should returne vnto the lande of his possession.
{35:29} So these thynges shalbe a lawe of iudgement vnto you, throughout your generations, in al your dwellinges.
{35:30} Whoso kylleth any person, the Iudge shall put the murtherer to death thorowe wytnesses: but one wytnesse shall not testifie agaynst any person, to cause hym to dye.
{35:31} Moreouer, ye shal take no recompence for the lyfe of the murtherer whiche is worthy to dye: but he shalbe put to death.
{35:32} And ye shall take no recompence for him that is fled to the citie of his refuge, that he shoulde come againe and dwell in the lande before the death of the hye priest.
{35:33} So ye shall not pollute the lande whiche ye shall dwell in, for blood defileth the lande: and the lande can not be clensed of the blood that is shed therin, but by the blood of hym that shed blood.
{35:34} Defile not therefore the lande whiche ye shal inhabite, for I am in the middes therof: euen I the Lord dwell among the chyldren of Israel.
{36:1} And the chiefe fathers of the families of the chyldren of Geliad, the sonne of Machir, the sonne of Manasse, of the kinred of the sonnes of Ioseph, came foorth and spake before Moyses, and before the princes the chiefe fathers of the chyldren of Israel,
{36:2} And sayd: The Lorde commaunded my Lorde to geue the land to inherite by lot to the chyldren of Israel: and my Lorde was commaunded by the Lord, to geue the inheritaunce of Zelaphead our brother, vnto his daughters.
{36:3} If they be maryed to any of ye sonnes of the other tribes of the chyldren of Israel, then shall their inheritaunce be taken from the inheritaunce of our fathers, and shalbe put to the inheritaunce of the tribe which they are receaued into, and so shal it be taken from the lot of our inheritaunce.
{36:4} And when the Iubilee of the children of Israel commeth, then shall their inheritaunce be put vnto the inheritaunce of the tribe wherinto they are receaued, and so shall their inheritaunce be taken away from the inheritaunce of the tribe of our fathers.
{36:5} And Moyses commaunded the chyldren of Israel, according to the worde of the Lorde, saying: The tribe of the sonnes of Ioseph haue sayd well.
{36:6} This therefore doth the Lorde commaunde the daughters of Zelaphead, saying: Let them be wyues, to whom they them selues thinke best: only to the familie of the tribe of their father shall they marry.
{36:7} So shall not the inheritaunce of the children of Israel remoue from tribe to tribe: for euery one of the chyldren of Israel shall ioyne hym selfe to the inheritaunce of the tribe of his fathers.
{36:8} And euery daughter that possesseth any inheritaunce in any tribe of the chyldre of Israel, shalbe wyfe vnto one of the kinred of the tribe of her father, that the chyldren of Israel may enioy euery man the inheritaunce of his father.
{36:9} Neither ought the inheritaunce to go from one tribe to another: but euery one of the tribes of the chyldren of Israel shalbe ioyned to his owne inheritaunce.
{36:10} And as the Lord commaunded Moyses, euen so dyd the daughters of Zelaphead:
{36:11} For Mahela, Thirza, Hagla, Milcha, and Noa the daughters of Zelaphead, were maryed vnto their fathers brothers sonnes.
{36:12} They were wyues vnto the families of the sonnes of Manasse the sonne of Ioseph, and so their inheritaunce remayned in the tribe of the kinred of their father.
{36:13} These are the comaundementes and lawes whiche the Lorde commaunded by the hande of Moyses vnto the chyldren of Israel, in the fieldes of Moab, by Iordane towarde Iericho.
