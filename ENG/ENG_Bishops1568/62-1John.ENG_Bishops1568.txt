{1:1} That whiche was fro the beginning, whiche we haue heard, which we haue seene with our eyes, whiche we haue loked vpo, & our handes haue handeled of, the worde of lyfe:
{1:2} (And the lyfe appeared, and we haue seene, and beare witnesse, and shewe vnto you that eternall lyfe which was with the father, and appeared vnto vs.)
{1:3} That which we haue seene and heard declare we vnto you, that ye also maye haue felowship with vs, and that our felowship may be with the father, and his sonne Iesus Christe.
{1:4} And this write we vnto you, that your ioy may be full,
{1:5} And this is the tydynges whiche we haue hearde of hym & declare vnto you, that God is lyght, & in hym is no darkenesse at all.
{1:6} If we saye that we haue felowship with hym, and walke in darkenesse, we lye, and do not the trueth.
{1:7} But and yf we walke in light, euen as he is in lyght, then haue we felowship one with another, and the blood of Iesus Christ his sonne clenseth vs from all sinne.
{1:8} If we say that we haue no sinne, we deceaue our selues, and the trueth is not in vs.
{1:9} If we knowledge our sinnes, he is faythfull & iust to forgeue vs our sinnes, and to clense vs from all vnryghteousnesse.
{1:10} If we say we haue not sinned, we make hym a lyer, and his worde is not in vs.
{2:1} My litle chyldren, these thynges write I vnto you, that ye sinne not. And yf any man sinne, we haue an aduocate with the father, Iesus Christe the ryghteous.
{2:2} And he is ye attonement for our sinnes: not for our sinnes only, but also for the sinnes of all the worlde.
{2:3} And hereby we are sure that we knowe hym, yf we kepe his comaundementes.
{2:4} He that sayth I knowe hym, and kepeth not his commaundementes, is a lyer, and the veritie is not in hym:
{2:5} But who so kepeth his worde, in him is the loue of God perfect in deede. Hereby knowe we that we are in hym.
{2:6} He that sayth he bydeth in him, ought to walke euen as he walked.
{2:7} Brethren, I write no newe comaundement vnto you, but that olde comaundement which ye haue had from the begynnyng. The olde commaundement is the worde which ye haue hearde fro the begynnyng.
{2:8} Agayne, a newe commaundement I write vnto you, that is true in hym, and the same is true also in you: For the darkenesse is past, and the true lyght nowe shyneth.
{2:9} He that sayth howe that he is in the lyght, and yet hateth his brother, is in darkenesse, euen vntyll this tyme.
{2:10} He that loueth his brother, abydeth in the lyght, and there is none occasion of euyll in hym.
{2:11} He that hateth his brother, is in darknesse, and walketh in darkenesse, & can not tell whyther he goeth, because that darkenesse hath blynded his eyes.
{2:12} Babes I write vnto you, because your sinnes are forgeuen you for his names sake.
{2:13} I write vnto you fathers, because ye haue knowen hym that is from the begynnyng. I write vnto you young men, because you haue ouercome the wicked.
{2:14} I write to you little chyldren, because ye haue knowe the father. I haue written to you fathers, because ye haue knowen hym that is from the begynnyng. I haue written vnto you young men, because, ye are stronge, and the worde of God abydeth in you, and ye haue ouercome the wicked.
{2:15} See that ye loue not the worlde, neither the thynges that are in the worlde. If any man loue the worlde, the loue of the father is not in hym.
{2:16} For all that is in the worlde, as the lust of the fleshe, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the father, but of the worlde.
{2:17} And the worlde passeth away, and the luste thereof: but he that fulfylleth the wyll of God, abydeth for euer.
{2:18} Litle chyldren, it is the last time, and as ye haue hearde howe that antichrist shall come, euen nowe are there many antichristes, whereby we knowe that it is the last tyme.
{2:19} They went out from vs, but they were not of vs: For yf they had ben of vs, they woulde no doubt haue continued with vs: But that it myght appeare that they were not of vs.
{2:20} Neuerthelesse, ye haue an oyntment of hym that is holy, and ye knowe all thynges.
{2:21} I haue not written vnto you, as though ye knewe not the trueth: but because ye knowe it, and that no lye is of the trueth.
{2:22} Who is a lyer, but he that denieth that Iesus is Christe? The same is antichrist that denyeth the father and the sonne.
{2:23} Whosoeuer denyeth the sonne, the same hath not the father But he that knowledgeth the sonne, hath the father also.
{2:24} Let therfore abyde in you, that same whiche ye hearde from the begynnyng. If that whiche ye hearde from the begynnyng shall remayne in you, ye also shall continue in the sonne, and in the father.
{2:25} And this is the promise that he hath promised vs, euen eternall lyfe.
{2:26} These thynges haue I written vnto you, concerning them that deceaue you:
{2:27} And the annoyntyng whiche ye haue receaued of hym dwelleth in you: And ye nede not that any man teach you, but as the same annoynting teacheth you of all thynges, and it is true, and not lying: and as it taught you, ye shall abyde in it.
{2:28} And nowe babes abide in him, that when he shal appeare, we may be bolde and not be made ashamed of hym at his commyng.
{2:29} If ye knowe that he is ryghteous, knowe also that euery one whiche doth righteousnes, is borne of hym.
{3:1} Beholde what loue the father hath shewed on vs, that we shoulde be called the sonnes of god: For this cause the worlde knoweth you not, because it knoweth not hym.
{3:2} Dearely beloued, nowe are we the sonnes of God, and yet it doth not appeare what we shalbe: But we knowe that when he shall appeare, we shalbe lyke hym, for we shall see hym as he is.
{3:3} And euery man that hath this hope in hym, purgeth hym selfe, euen as he also is pure.
{3:4} Whosoeuer committeth sinne, transgresseth also the lawe: for sinne is the transgression of the lawe.
{3:5} And ye know that he appeared to take away our sinnes, & in hym is no sinne.
{3:6} As many as byde in hym, sinne not: whosoeuer sinneth, hath not seene him, neither knowen hym.
{3:7} Babes, let no man deceaue you: He that doeth righteousnes, is ryghteous, euen as he is righteous.
{3:8} He that committeth sinne, is of the deuyll: for the deuyll sinneth sence the beginning. For this purpose appeared the sonne of God, to loose the workes of the deuyll.
{3:9} Whosoeuer is borne of God, sinneth not: for his seede remayneth in him, and he can not sinne, because he is borne of God.
{3:10} In this are ye children of God knowe, and the chyldren of the deuyll: Whosoeuer doth not ryghteousnesse, is not of God, neither he that loueth not his brother.
{3:11} For this is the tidynges that ye heard from the begynnyng, that ye shoulde loue one another.
{3:12} Not as Cain, which was of that wicked, and slewe his brother: And wherfore slewe he hym? Because his owne workes were euyll, and his brothers good.
{3:13} Maruayle not my brethren though the worlde hate you.
{3:14} We knowe, that we are translated from death vnto lyfe, because we loue the brethren. He that loueth not his brother, abideth in death.
{3:15} Whosoeuer hateth his brother, is a manslear: And ye knowe that no manslear, hath eternall life abidyng in hym.
{3:16} Hereby perceaue we loue, because he layde downe his lyfe for vs, & we ought to lay downe our lyues for the brethren.
{3:17} But who so hath this worldes good, and seeth his brother haue neede, and shutteth vp his compassion from hym: howe dwelleth the loue of God in hym?
{3:18} My babes, let vs not loue in worde, neither in tongue: but in deede and in veritie.
{3:19} Hereby we knowe that we are of the trueth, and shall assure our heartes before hym.
{3:20} For yf our heart condempne vs, God is greater then our heart, and knoweth all thynges.
{3:21} Dearely beloued, yf our heart condempne vs not, then haue we boldnesse towarde God.
{3:22} And whatsoeuer we aske, we receaue of hym, because we kepe his commaundementes, and do those thynges which are pleasyng in his syght.
{3:23} And this is his comaundement, that we beleue on the name of his sonne Iesus Christe, and loue one another, as he gaue commaundement.
{3:24} And he that kepeth his commaundementes, dwelleth in him, and he in him: and hereby we knowe that he abideth in vs, euen by the spirite which he hath geuen vs.
{4:1} Dearly beloued, beleue not euery spirite: but proue the spirites whether they are of God or not: for many false prophetes are gone out into the worlde.
{4:2} Hereby shall ye knowe the spirite of God: Euery spirite that confesseth that Iesus Christe is come in the fleshe, is of God:
{4:3} And euery spirite which confesseth not that Iesus Christe is come in the fleshe, is not of God. And this is that spirite of antichriste, of whom ye haue hearde howe that he shoulde come: and euen nowe alredy is he in the worlde.
{4:4} Litle chyldren, ye are of God, & haue ouercome them: for greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the worlde.
{4:5} They are of the world, therfore speake they of the worlde, & the world heareth them.
{4:6} We are of God. He that knoweth God, heareth vs: he that is not of God, heareth vs not. Hereby knowe we the spirite of veritie, and the spirite of errour.
{4:7} Dearely beloued, let vs loue one another, for loue commeth of God: And euery one that loueth, is borne of God, and knoweth God.
{4:8} He that loueth not, knoweth not God: for God is loue.
{4:9} In this appeared the loue of God to vs warde, because God sent his only begotten sonne into the worlde, that we myght lyue through hym.
{4:10} Herein is loue, not that we loued God, but that he loued vs, and sent his sonne to be the agreement for our sinnes.
{4:11} Dearely beloued, yf God so loued vs, we ought also to loue one another.
{4:12} No man hath seene God at any time. If we loue one another, God dwelleth in vs, and his loue is perfect in vs.
{4:13} Hereby knowe we that we dwell in hym, & he in vs: because he hath geuen vs of his spirite.
{4:14} And we haue seene, and do testifie that the father sent the sonne to be the sauiour of the worlde.
{4:15} Whosoeuer confesseth that Iesus is the sonne of God, in him dwelleth God, and he in God.
{4:16} And we haue knowen and beleued the loue that God hath to vs. God is loue, and he that dwelleth in loue, dwelleth in God, and God in hym.
{4:17} Herein is the loue perfect in vs, that we shoulde haue boldnesse in the day of iudgement: For as he is, euen so are we in this worlde.
{4:18} There is no feare in loue, but perfect loue casteth out feare: for feare hath paynefulnesse. He that feareth, is not perfect in loue.
{4:19} We loue hym, for he loued vs first.
{4:20} If a man say, I loue God, & yet hate his brother, he is a lyer: For how can he yt loueth not his brother whom he hath seene, loue God who he hath not seene?
{4:21} And this commaundement haue we of hym: that he which loueth God, shoulde loue his brother also.
{5:1} Whosoeuer beleueth that Iesus is Christe, is borne of God: And euerie one that loueth him which begat, loueth hym also which is begotten of hym.
{5:2} By this we knowe that we loue the chyldren of God, when we loue God, and kepe his commaundementes.
{5:3} For this is the loue of God, that we kepe his commaundementes, and his commaundementes are not greeuous.
{5:4} For all that is borne of God, ouercommeth the worlde. And this is the victorie that ouercommeth ye worlde, euen our fayth.
{5:5} Who is it that ouercommeth ye worlde, but he which beleueth that Iesus is the sonne of God?
{5:6} This Iesus Christe, is he that came by water and blood: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the spirite that beareth witnesse, because the spirite is trueth.
{5:7} For there are three which beare recorde in heauen, the father, the worde, and the holy ghost, and these three are one.
{5:8} And there are three which beare recorde in earth, the spirite, and water, and blood, and these three agree in one.
{5:9} If we receaue the witnesse of men, the witnesse of God is greater: For this is the witnesse of God that is greater which he testified of his sonne.
{5:10} He that beleueth on the sonne of God, hath the witnesse in hym selfe: He that beleueth not God, hath made hym a lyer, because he beleued not the recorde that God gaue of his sonne.
{5:11} And this is the recorde, how that God hath geuen vnto vs eternall lyfe, and this lyfe, is in his sonne.
{5:12} He that hath the sonne, hath lyfe: and he that hath not the sonne of God, hath not lyfe.
{5:13} These thynges haue I written vnto you that beleue on ye name of the sonne of God, that ye may knowe howe that ye haue eternall lyfe, and that ye may beleue on the name of the sonne of God.
{5:14} And this is the trust that we haue in hym: that yf we aske any thyng accordyng to his wyll, he heareth vs.
{5:15} And yf we knowe that he heare vs, whatsoeuer we aske: we know that we haue ye petitions that we desire of hym.
{5:16} If any man see his brother sinne a sinne not vnto death, let hym aske, and he shal geue him life for them that sinne not vnto death. There is a sinne vnto death: I say not that thou shouldest pray for it.
{5:17} All vnrighteousnes is sinne: and there is sinne vnto death.
{5:18} We knowe that whosoeuer is borne of God, sinneth not: but he that is begotten of God, kepeth hym selfe, and that wicked toucheth hym not.
{5:19} We knowe that we are of God, & the whole worlde lieth in wickednesse.
{5:20} We knowe that the sonne of God is come, & hath geuen vs a minde to know hym which is true: and we are in hym that is true, through his sonne Iesus Christe. This same is very God, and eternall lyfe.
{5:21} Babes kepe your selues from idols. Amen.
