{1:1} Paul an Apostle of Iesus Christe by the wyll of God, according to the promise of lyfe, which is in Christ Iesus,
{1:2} To Timothie a beloued sonne: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the father, and Christe Iesus our Lorde.
{1:3} I thanke God whom I worshippe from my forefathers in pure conscience, that without ceassyng I haue remembrauce of thee in my prayers night & day
{1:4} Desiryng to see thee, myndefull of thy teares: that I may be fylled with ioy.
{1:5} When I call to remembraunce the vnfaigned fayth that is in thee, whiche dwelt first in thy graundmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunica: and I am assured that it dwelleth in thee also.
{1:6} Wherfore I put thee in remebraunce that thou stirre vp the gyft of God, which is in thee by the puttyng on of my handes.
{1:7} For God hath not geuen to vs the spirite of feare: but of power, and of loue, and of a sounde mynde.
{1:8} Be not thou therfore ashamed of the testimonie of our Lorde, neither of me his prisoner: but suffer thou aduersitie with the Gospell, accordyng to the power of God,
{1:9} Who hath saued vs, & called vs with an holy callyng, not accordyng to our workes: but accordyng to his owne purpose and grace, which was geuen vs in Christe Iesus, before the world began:
{1:10} But is nowe made manifest by the appearyng of our sauiour Iesus Christ, who hath put away death, and hath brought life and immortalitie vnto light through the Gospell:
{1:11} Wherunto I am appoynted, a preacher and Apostle, and a teacher of the gentiles:
{1:12} For the which cause I also suffer these thynges. Neuerthelesse, I am not ashamed: For I knowe whom I haue beleued, and I am perswaded that he is able to kepe that which I haue committed to hym, agaynst that day.
{1:13} See thou haue the paterne of wholesome wordes, which thou hast hearde of me in fayth & loue, that is in Christe Iesus.
{1:14} That good thyng which was committed to thy keping, holde fast through the holy ghost which dwelleth in vs.
{1:15} This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia, be turned from me: of who are Phygellus & Hermogenes.
{1:16} The Lorde geue mercie vnto ye house of Onesiphorus, for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chayne.
{1:17} But whe he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and founde me.
{1:18} The Lorde graunt vnto hym, that he may fynde mercie with the Lorde in that day: And in howe many thynges he ministred vnto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
{2:1} Thou therfore my sonne, be strong in the grace that is in Christe Iesus.
{2:2} And the thynges that thou haste hearde of me by many witnesses, the same commit thou to faythfull men, which shalbe apt to teache other also.
{2:3} Thou therfore suffer afflictions as a good souldier of Iesus Christe.
{2:4} No man that warreth, entangleth hym selfe with thaffayres of this lyfe, that he may please hym which hath chosen hym to be a souldier.
{2:5} And if a man also wrestle, yet is he not crowned except he wrestle lawfullie.
{2:6} The labouryng husbandman, must first be partaker of the fruites.
{2:7} Consider What I say: and the Lorde geue thee vnderstandyng in all thinges.
{2:8} Remember that Iesus Christe, of the seede of Dauid, was raysed from the dead, accordyng to my Gospell,
{2:9} Wherin I suffer trouble as an euyll doer, euen vnto bondes: But the worde of God is not bounde.
{2:10} Therfore I suffer all thynges for the electes sakes, that they myght also obtaine the saluation, which is in Christ Iesus, with eternall glorie.
{2:11} It is a faythfull saying: for yf we be dead with hym, we shall also lyue with hym:
{2:12} If we be patient, we shall also raigne with hym: If we denie hym, he also shall denie vs.
{2:13} If we be vnfaythful, he abideth faithfull, he can not denie hym selfe.
{2:14} Of these thynges put them in remembraunce, testifie before the Lorde, that they striue not about wordes to no profite, but to the peruertyng of ye hearers.
{2:15} Studie to shewe thy selfe approued vnto God, a workman not to be ashamed, rightlie deuidyng the worde of trueth.
{2:16} But prophane voyces of vanitie passe ouer: For they wyll encrease vnto greater vngodlynesse.
{2:17} And their worde shall fret as doth a cancker: of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus,
{2:18} Which about the trueth haue erred, saying that the resurrection is past alredie, & do ouerthrowe the fayth of some.
{2:19} But the strong foundation of God standeth styl, hauyng this seale: The Lorde knoweth the that are his: And, let euery one that nameth the name of Christe, depart from iniquitie.
{2:20} But in a great house are not onely vessels of golde, and of siluer, but also of wood and of earth: some to honour, and some vnto dishonour.
{2:21} If a man therfore pourge hym selfe from these, he shalbe a vessell vnto honour, and meete for ye vses of the Lorde, and prepared vnto euery good worke.
{2:22} Lustes of youth auoyde, but folowe ryghteousnesse, fayth, loue, peace, with them that call on the Lorde out of a pure heart.
{2:23} But foolishe & vnlearned questions put from thee, knowyng that they do but gender strife.
{2:24} And the seruaunt of the Lorde must not striue: but be gentle vnto all men, apt to teache, sufferyng euyll in mekenesse,
{2:25} Instructing the which are contrarie mynded, yf God at any tyme wyll geue them repentaunce, to the knowledge of the trueth:
{2:26} And that they may come to the selues agayne, out of the snare of the deuyll, which are holden captyue of hym at his wyll.
{3:1} This knowe also, that in the last dayes, perylous tymes shalbe at hande.
{3:2} For men shalbe louers of their owne selues, couetous, boasters, proude, blasphemers, disobedient to fathers and mothers, vnthankefull, vngodlye:
{3:3} Without naturall affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, riotous, fierce, despisers of them which are good,
{3:4} Traytours, headdy, hye mynded, louers of pleasures more then louers of God:
{3:5} Hauyng a fourme of godlynesse, but denying the power therof: turne away from these.
{3:6} These are they, which enter into houses, & leade captiue simple women laden with sinne, caryed with diuers lustes:
{3:7} Euer learnyng, and neuer able to come vnto the knowledge of the trueth.
{3:8} For as Iannes and Iambres withstoode Moyses, so do these also resist the trueth: Men of corrupt myndes, reprobate concernyng the fayth:
{3:9} But they shall preuayle no longer. For their madnesse shalbe manifest vnto all men as also theirs was.
{3:10} But thou hast folowed my doctrine, fashion of lyuyng, purpose, fayth, long sufferyng, loue, patience,
{3:11} Persecutions, afflictions, which came vnto me at Antioche, at Iconium, at Lystra, which persecutions I suffred patiently: And from them all, the Lord deliuered me.
{3:12} Yea, and all that wyll lyue godly in Christe Iesus, shall suffer persecution.
{3:13} But the euyll men and deceauers, shall waxe worse and worse, deceauyng and deceaued.
{3:14} But continue thou in the thynges which thou haste learned, which also were committed vnto thee, knowyng of whom thou hast learned them:
{3:15} And that from an infant thou hast knowen the scriptures, which are able to make thee wyse vnto saluation, thorowe fayth which is in Christe Iesus.
{3:16} All scripture is geuen by inspiration of God, and is profitable to doctrine, to reproue, to correction, to instruction which is in ryghteousnesse,
{3:17} That the man of God may be perfect, instructed vnto all good workes.
{4:1} I testifie therefore before God, & the Lorde Iesus Christe, which shall iudge the quicke and the dead at his appearyng, and his kingdome.
{4:2} Preache the worde, be instant in season, out of season: Improue, rebuke, exhort in all long sufferyng and doctrine.
{4:3} For the tyme wyll come, when they shall not suffer wholsome doctrine: but after their owne lustes, shal they whose eares itche, get the an heape of teachers:
{4:4} And shall turne away their hearyng from the trueth, and shalbe turned vnto fables.
{4:5} But watche thou in all thynges, suffer afflictions, do the worke of an Euangelist, fulfyll thy ministerie:
{4:6} For I am nowe redie to be offered, & the tyme of my dissolution is at hande.
{4:7} I haue fought a good fyght, I haue fulfylled my course, I haue kept ye faith.
{4:8} Hencefoorth there is layde vp for me a crowne of ryghteousnesse, which the Lorde, the ryghteous iudge, shall geue me at that day: not to me only, but vnto the also yt haue loued his appearyng.
{4:9} Do thy diligence to come shortly vnto me.
{4:10} For Demas hath forsaken me, hauing loued this present worlde, and is departed vnto Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus vnto Dalmatia.
{4:11} Only Luke is with me. Takyng Marke and bryng him with thee, for he is profitable vnto me for ye ministration.
{4:12} And Tychicus haue I sent to Ephesus.
{4:13} The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, whe thou commest bring with thee, and the bookes, but specially the parchementes.
{4:14} Alexander the coppersmith shewed me much euyll: The Lorde rewarde hym accordyng to his deedes.
{4:15} Of whom be thou ware also: For he hath greatly withstande our preaching.
{4:16} At my first aunsweryng, no man assisted me, but all forsoke me, I pray God yt it may not be layde to their charges:
{4:17} Notwithstandyng, the Lorde assisted me, and strengthed me, that by me the preachyng should be fulfylled to the vtmost, and that all the gentiles should heare, and I was deliuered out of the mouth of the Lion.
{4:18} And the Lorde shall delyuer me from euery euyll worke, & will preserue me vnto his heauenly kingdome: To who be prayse for euer and euer. Amen.
{4:19} Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the housholde of Onesiphorus.
{4:20} Erastus abode at Corinthum: But Trophimus haue I left at Miletum sicke.
{4:21} Do thy diligece to come before winter. Eubolus greeteth thee, and Pudens, & Linus, and Claudia, & all the brethre.
{4:22} The Lorde Iesus Christe be with thy spirite: Grace be with you. Amen. The seconde epistle vnto Timothe, was written from Rome, when Paul was presented the seconde tyme vnto the Emperour Nero.
