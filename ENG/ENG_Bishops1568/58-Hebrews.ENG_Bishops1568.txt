{1:1} God which in time past, at sundrie tymes, and in diuers maners, spake vnto the fathers in the prophetes:
{1:2} Hath in these last dayes, spoken vnto vs in the sonne, whom he hath appoynted heyre of all thynges, by whom also he made the worldes.
{1:3} Who beyng the bryghtnesse of the glorie, and the very image of his substaunce, vpholdyng all thynges with the worde of his power, hauing by him selfe pourged our sinnes, hath syt on the ryght hande of the maiestie on hye:
{1:4} Beyng so much more excellent then the Angels, as he hath by inheritaunce obtayned a more excellent name then they.
{1:5} For vnto which of the Angels sayde he at any tyme: Thou art my sonne, this day haue I begotten thee?
{1:6} And agayne, I wyll be to hym a father, and he shalbe to me a sonne? And agayne, when he bryngeth in the first begotten sonne into the worlde, he saith: And let all the Angels of God worship hym.
{1:7} And vnto the Angels he sayth: He maketh his Angels spirites, and his ministers a flambe of fyre.
{1:8} But vnto the sonne he sayth Thy seate O God, shalbe for euer and euer: The scepter of thy kyngdome is a scepter of ryghteousnesse.
{1:9} Thou hast loued ryghteousnesse, and hated iniquitie: Therfore God, euen thy God, hath annoynted thee with the oyle of gladnesse, aboue thy felowes.
{1:10} And thou Lorde, in the begynnyng hast layde the foundation of the earth: And the heauens are the workes of thy handes:
{1:11} They shall perishe, but thou endurest, and they shall waxe olde as doth a garment:
{1:12} And as a vesture shalt thou folde the vp, and they shalbe chaunged: but thou art the same, & thy yeres shall not fayle.
{1:13} But vnto which of ye Angels sayde he at any tyme: Sitte on my right hande, tyll I make thyne enemies thy foote stoole?
{1:14} Are they not all ministring spirites, sent foorth into ministerie for their sakes which shalbe heyres of saluation?
{2:1} Wherfore we ought to geue the more earnest heede to the thynges which we haue heard, lest at any tyme we should let them slippe.
{2:2} For yf the worde spoken by Angels, was stedfast: And euery transgression and disobedience receaued a iust recompense of rewarde:
{2:3} Howe shall we escape, yf we neglect so great saluation? which at the first began to be preached of the Lorde, and was confirmed vnto vswarde, by them that hearde it:
{2:4} God bearyng witnesse therto both with signes & wonders also, and with diuers powers and gyftes of the holy ghost, accordyng to his owne wyll.
{2:5} For vnto the Anges hath he not put in subiection the worlde to come, wherof we speake.
{2:6} But one in a certayne place witnessed, saying: What is man, that thou arte myndeful of hym? Or the sonne of man, that thou wouldest loke vpon hym?
{2:7} Thou madest hym for a litle whyle lower then the Angels, thou hast crowned him with glorie and honour, and hast set hym aboue the workes of thy handes.
{2:8} Thou hast put all thynges in subiectio vnder his feete. In yt he put all thinges vnder hym, he left nothyng that is not put vnder hym. But nowe, we see not yet all thynges put vnder hym.
{2:9} But hym that for a whyle was made lesse then the Angels, we see that it was Iesus, who through the sufferyng of death, was crowned with glorie and honour, that he by the grace of God, shoulde taste of death for all.
{2:10} For it became hym, for whom are all thynges, and by whom are all thynges, after he had brought many sonnes vnto glorie, that he shoulde make the capitayne of their saluation perfect through afflictions.
{2:11} For both he that sanctifieth, and they which are sanctified, are all of one. For which cause, he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
{2:12} Saying: I wyll declare thy name vnto my brethren, in the myddes of the Churche wyll I prayse thee.
{2:13} And agayne: I wyll put my trust in hym. And agayne: Beholde here am I, and the chyldren whiche God hath geuen me.
{2:14} Forasmuch then as the chyldren are partakers of flesshe and blood, he also hym selfe lykewyse toke part with the, that through death he myght expell hym that had lordship ouer death, that is the deuyll:
{2:15} And that he myght delyuer them, which through feare of death, were all their lyfe tyme in daunger of bondage.
{2:16} For he in no place taketh on hym the Angels: but the seede of Abraham taketh he on hym.
{2:17} Wherfore, in all thinges it became him to be made lyke vnto his brethren, that he myght be mercyfull, and a faythfull hye priest in thynges concernyng God, for to purge the peoples sinnes.
{2:18} For in that he hym selfe suffered and was tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
{3:1} Therfore holy brethren, partakers of the celestiall callyng, consider the apostle and hye priest of our profession Christe Iesus,
{3:2} Beyng faythfull to hym that appoynted hym, as also was Moyses in all his house.
{3:3} For this man is counted worthy of more glorie then Moyses, inasmuch as he which hath buylded the house, hath more honour then the house.
{3:4} For euery house is buylded of some man: But he that buylded all thynges, is God.
{3:5} And Moyses veryly was faythfull in al his house, as a minister, for a witnesse of those thynges whiche were to be spoken after:
{3:6} But Christe as a sonne hath rule ouer his owne house, whose house are we, yf we holde fast the confidence and the reioycyng of that hope vnto the ende.
{3:7} Wherfore, as the holy ghost saith: Today yf ye wyll heare his voyce,
{3:8} Harden not your heartes, as in the prouokyng, in the day of the temptation in the wyldernesse,
{3:9} Where your fathers tempted me, proued me, and sawe my workes 40 yeres.
{3:10} Wherfore I was greeued with that generation, and sayde: they do alway erre in heart, they veryly haue not knowen my wayes.
{3:11} So that I sware in my wrath, yf they shall enter into my rest.
{3:12} Take heede brethren, lest at any tyme there be in you an euyll heart of vnbeliefe, to depart from the lyuyng God:
{3:13} But exhort ye one another dayly, whyle it is called to day, lest any of you be hardened, through the deceytfulnesse of sinne.
{3:14} For we are made partakers of Christe, yf we kepe sure vnto the ende the begynnyng of the substaunce,
{3:15} So long as it is said: to day yf ye wyll heare his voyce, harden not your heartes, as in the prouokyng.
{3:16} For some when they had hearde, dyd prouoke: howe be it, not all that came out of Egypt by Moyses.
{3:17} But with whom was he displeased fourtie yeres? Not with them that had sinned, whose carkases fell in the desert?
{3:18} And to who sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but vnto them that were not obedient?
{3:19} And we see that they coulde not enter in, because of vnbeliefe.
{4:1} Let vs feare therfore, lest at any tyme, by forsakyng the promise of entryng into his reste, any of you shoulde be defrauded.
{4:2} For vnto vs was the Gospell preached, aswell as vnto them: But the worde whiche they hearde dyd not profite them, not beyng coupled with fayth to them that hearde.
{4:3} For we which haue beleued, do enter into his rest, as he sayde: Euen as I haue sworne in my wrath, if they shal enter into my rest. Although the workes were made perfecte from the foundation of the worlde.
{4:4} For he spake in a certayne place of the seuenth daye on this wyse: And God dyd rest the seuenth daye from all his workes.
{4:5} And in this place againe: yf they shall enter into my rest.
{4:6} Seing therfore it foloweth, that some must enter there into, and they to who the Gospell was first preached entred not therin for vnbeliefe.
{4:7} Againe, he appoynteth a certaine day, by to day, saying in Dauid after so long a tyme (as it is sayde:) To day yf ye wyl heare his voyce, harde not your hearts.
{4:8} For yf Iesus had geuen them reste, then woulde he not afterwarde haue spoken of another day.
{4:9} There remayneth therfore yet a rest to the people of God.
{4:10} For he that is entred into his rest, hath ceassed also from his owne workes, as God dyd from his.
{4:11} Let vs studie therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same ensample of disobedience.
{4:12} For the worde of God is quicke, and myghtie in operation, and sharper then any two edged sword, and entreth thorowe, euen vnto the deuydyng a sunder of the soule & the spirite, and of the ioyntes & the marie, and is a discerner of the thoughtes and of the intentes of the heart:
{4:13} Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in the syght of hym: But all thinges are naked and open vnto the eyes of hym of whom we speake.
{4:14} Seyng then that we haue a great hye priest, which is entred into heauens, Iesus the sonne of God, let vs holde faste the confession.
{4:15} For we haue not an hye priest whiche can not be touched with the feelyng of our infirmities: but was in all poyntes tempted lyke as we are, and yet without sinne.
{4:16} Let vs therfore come boldly vnto the throne of grace, that we may obteyne mercie, and fynde grace to helpe in time of neede.
{5:1} For euery hye priest taken from among men, is ordeined for men, in things parteynyng to God, to offer gyftes & sacrifices for sinne:
{5:2} Which can sufficiently haue compassion on the ignoraunt, & on them that erre out of the waye, forasmuche as he hym selfe also is compassed with infirmitie.
{5:3} And for ye same infirmitie he is bounde to offer for sinnes, aswell for hym selfe, as for the people.
{5:4} And no man taketh the honour vnto hym selfe, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.
{5:5} Euen so, Christ also glorified not hym selfe to be made ye hye priest: but he that sayde vnto hym, thou art my sonne, to day haue I begotten thee gaue it hym.
{5:6} As he saith also in another place: thou art a priest for euer, after the order of Melchisedech.
{5:7} Which in the dayes of his fleshe, when he had offered vp prayers and supplications with strong crying and teares, vnto hym that was able to saue hym from death, and was hearde in that which he feared:
{5:8} Though he were the sonne, yet learned he obediece, by these thinges which he suffred:
{5:9} And being perfect, was made the aucthour of eternall saluation vnto al them that obey hym:
{5:10} And is called of God an hye priest after the order of Melchisedech.
{5:11} Of whom we haue many thynges to say, and harde to be vttered, seing ye are dull of hearyng.
{5:12} For when as concernyng the tyme, ye ought to be teachers, yet haue ye nede againe that we teache you the first principles of the begynnyng of the worde of God, and are become such as haue nede of mylke, and not of strong meate.
{5:13} For euery one that vseth mylke, is vnexpert of the worde of righteousnes, for he is a babe.
{5:14} But strong meate belongeth to them that are perfecte, euen those whiche by reason of vse, haue their wittes exercised to discerne both good and euyll.
{6:1} Therefore leauyng the doctrine of the begynnyng of Christe, let vs go foorth vnto perfection, not laying agayne the foundatio of repentaunce from dead workes, and of fayth towarde God,
{6:2} Of the doctrine of baptismes, and of laying on of handes, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternall iudgement.
{6:3} And this wyll I do, yf God permit.
{6:4} For it can not be that they which were once lighted, and haue tasted of the heauenly gyft, and were become partakers of the holy ghost,
{6:5} And haue tasted of the good worde of God, and the powers of the worlde to come:
{6:6} And they fall away, shoulde be renued agayne into repentaunce, hauyng crucified to the selues the sonne of God a fresshe, and made a mocke of hym.
{6:7} For the earth which drynketh in the rayne that commeth oft vppon it, and bringeth foorth hearbes meete for them by whom also it is dressed, receaueth blessyng of God:
{6:8} But that grounde whiche beareth thornes and bryers, is reproued, and is nye vnto cursyng, whose ende is to be burned.
{6:9} Neuerthelesse, deare frendes, we haue perswaded our selues better thynges of you, and thynges whiche accompanie saluation, though we thus speake.
{6:10} For God is not vnryghteous, to forget your worke & labour of loue, whiche ye haue shewed towarde his name, hauyng ministred to the saintes, and do minister.
{6:11} Yea and we desire that euery one of you do shewe the same diligence, to the full assuraunce of hope, vnto the ende,
{6:12} That ye faynt not, but be folowers of them which through fayth and pacience inherite the promises.
{6:13} For when God made promise to Abraham, because he had no greater to sweare by, he sware by hym selfe,
{6:14} Saying: Surely, blessyng I wyll blesse thee, and multipliyng, multiplie thee.
{6:15} And so after that he had taryed paciently, he enioyed the promise.
{6:16} For men veryly sweare by the greater, and an oth for confirmation, is to them an ende of all stryfe.
{6:17} Wherein God wyllyng very aboundauntly to shewe vnto the heires of promise, the stablenesse of his counsayle, confirmed by an oth:
{6:18} That by two immutable thynges, in whiche it was vnpossible for God to lye, we myght haue a strong consolation, which haue fledde to holde fast the hope layde before vs:
{6:19} Which hope we holde as an ancker of the soule both sure and stedfast, and entryng in, into that thing which is within the vayle:
{6:20} Whyther the forerunner is for vs entred euen Iesus, after the order of Melchisedech made a priest for euer.
{7:1} For this Melchisedech kyng of Salem, priest of the most hye God, who met Abraham returnyng from the slaughter of the kynges, and blessed hym:
{7:2} To whom also Abraham gaue tythe of all thynges, first being called by interpretatio king of righteousnes, & after yt also, kyng of Salem, which is, kyng of peace.
{7:3} Without father, without mother, without kynne, hauyng neither beginnyng of dayes, neither ende of lyfe, but lykened vnto the sonne of God, and continueth a priest for euer.
{7:4} Nowe consider howe great this man was, vnto whom also the patriarche Abraham gaue tythe of the spoyles.
{7:5} And veryly they which are of the children of Leuie, which receaue the office of the priesthood, haue a commaundement to take tythe of the people accordyng to the lawe, that is, of their brethren, though they came out of ye loynes of Abraham.
{7:6} But he whose kynrede is not counted among them, receaued tythe of Abraham, and blessed hym that had the promises.
{7:7} And without all controuersie, the lesse is blessed of the better.
{7:8} And here men that dye, receaue tithes: but there he receaueth them of whom it is witnessed that he lyueth.
{7:9} And to say the trueth, Leuie also whiche receaueth tythes, payed tythes in Abraham.
{7:10} For he was yet in the loynes of his father, when Melchisedech met Abraham.
{7:11} If therefore perfection was by the priesthood of ye Leuites (For vnder that priesthood the people receaued the law) what neded it furthermore that another priest shoulde rise after the order of Melchisedech, and not to be called after the order of Aaron?
{7:12} For yf the priesthood be translated, of necessitie also there is made a translation of the lawe.
{7:13} For he of whom these thynges are spoken, parteyneth vnto another tribe, of which no man stoode at the aulter.
{7:14} For it is euident that our Lord sprong out of Iuda, of which tribe spake Moyses nothyng concernyng priesthood:
{7:15} And it is yet a farre more euidet thing, yf after the similitude of Melchisedech there aryse another priest,
{7:16} Which is not made after the lawe of the carnall commaundement, but after the power of the endlesse lyfe:
{7:17} For he testifieth that thou art a priest for euer, after the order of Melchisedech.
{7:18} For there is truely a disanulling of the commaundement goyng before, for the weakenesse and vnprofitablenesse therof.
{7:19} For the lawe made nothyng perfect, but was the bryngyng in of a better hope, by the whiche we drawe nygh vnto God.
{7:20} And in as much as that was not without an oth (For those priestes were made without an oth:
{7:21} But this priest with an oth, by hym that saide vnto him: The Lord sware and wyll not repent, thou art a priest for euer, after the order of Melchisedech.)
{7:22} By so much was Iesus made a suertie of a better testament.
{7:23} And among them many were made priestes, because they were forbidden by death to endure.
{7:24} But this man, because he endureth euer, hath an vnchaungeable priesthood.
{7:25} Wherefore he is able also euer to saue them to the vttermost that come vnto God by hym, seyng he euer lyueth to make intercession for them.
{7:26} For such an hye priest became vs, whiche is holy, harmelesse, vndefyled, seperate from sinners, and made hygher then heauens:
{7:27} Whiche nedeth not dayly, as those hie priestes, to offer vp sacrifice, first for his owne sinnes, and then for the peoples: for that dyd he once, when he offered vp hym selfe.
{7:28} For the lawe maketh men hye priestes which haue infirmitie: but the word of the oth which (was) after the lawe (maketh) the sonne, whiche is perfecte for euermore.
{8:1} But of the thinges whiche we haue spoken, this is ye summe: We haue such an hye priest that sitteth on ye ryght hand of ye throne of the maiestie in the heaues,
{8:2} A minister of holy thynges, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pight, and not man.
{8:3} For euery hye priest is ordeyned to offer gyftes and sacrifices: Wherefore it is of necessitie, that this man haue somewhat also to offer.
{8:4} For he were not a priest, yf he were on the earth, seyng there are priestes that accordyng to the lawe offer gyftes,
{8:5} Who serue vnto the example and shadowe of heauenly thinges, as Moyses was admonished of God, when he was about to finishe the tabernacle: For see, saith he, that thou make all thynges accordyng to the patterne shewed to thee in the mount.
{8:6} But nowe hath he obteyned a more excellent office, by howe much also he is the mediatour of a better couenaunt, whiche was confirmed in better promises.
{8:7} For yf that first couenaunt had ben founde fautlesse, then shoulde no place haue ben sought for the seconde.
{8:8} For in rebukyng them, he saith: Beholde the dayes come, saith the Lord, and I wyll finishe vppon the house of Israel and vppon the house of Iuda a newe couenaunt:
{8:9} Not lyke that that I made with their fathers, in the day when I toke them by the hande, to leade them out of the lande of Egypt: because they continued not in my couenaunt, and I regarded them not, saith the Lorde.
{8:10} For this is the couenaunt that I wyll make with the house of Israel after those dayes, saith the Lord, geuyng my lawes into their mynde, and in their heart I wyl write them, and I wyll be to them a God, and they shalbe to me a people.
{8:11} And they shall not teach euery man his neyghbour, and euery man his brother, saying, knowe the Lorde: for all shall knowe me, from the litle of them to the great of them.
{8:12} For I wyll be mercyfull to their vnrighteousnes, and their sinnes and their iniquities wyll I thynke vpon no more.
{8:13} In that he sayth a newe couenaunt he hath worne out the first: For that which is worne out and waxed olde, is redie to vanishe away.
{9:1} The first couenaunt then had verylye iustifiyng ordinaunces, seruinges of God, and worldlye holynesse.
{9:2} For there was a fore tabernacle made, wherein was the lyght, and the table, and the shewe bread, whiche is called holy.
{9:3} But after the seconde vayle was a tabernacle, which is called holyest of al:
{9:4} Which had the golden senser, and the arke of the couenaunt ouerlaide rounde about with golde, wherin was the golden pot hauyng Manna, and Aarons rodde that had budded, and the tables of the couenaunt:
{9:5} And ouer it, the Cherubins of glorie, shadowyng the mercie seate: Of which thynges we can not nowe speake particulerlie.
{9:6} When these thynges were thus ordeyned, the priestes went alwayes into the first tabernacle, accomplishyng the seruice of God.
{9:7} But into ye seconde (went) the hye priest alone once euery yere, not without blood, which he offered for hym selfe, & for the ignorauncies of the people.
{9:8} The holy ghost this signifiyng, that the waye of holy thinges was not yet opened, whyle as yet the first tabernacle was standyng:
{9:9} Whiche (was) a similitude for the tyme then preset, in which were offred giftes and sacrifices, that coulde not make the worshipper perfect as parteining to the conscience,
{9:10} With only meates and drynkes, and diuers wasshynges, and iustifiynges of the flesshe, which were layde vp vntyll the tyme of reformation.
{9:11} But Christe beyng come an hye priest of good thynges that shoulde be, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with handes, that is to say, not of this buyldyng,
{9:12} Neither by the blood of Goates and Calues: but by his owne blood he entred in once into the holy place, & founde eternall redemption.
{9:13} For if the blood of Oxen & of Goates, and the asshes of a young Cowe, sprinklyng the vncleane, sanctifieth to the purifiyng of the flesshe:
{9:14} Howe much more the blood of Christe, which through the eternall spirite offered hym selfe without spot to God, shall purge your conscience fro dead workes, to serue the lyuyng God?
{9:15} And for this cause is he the mediatour of the newe couenaunt, that through death, which was for the redemption of the transgressions that were vnder the first couenaunt, they whiche are called myght receaue the promise of eternall inheritaunce.
{9:16} For where as is a testament, there must also of necessitie be the death of him that maketh it.
{9:17} For a testament is confirmed when men are dead: for it is yet of no value, as long as he that maketh the testamet is alyue.
{9:18} For which cause also, neither the firste testament was dedicated without blood.
{9:19} For when Moyses had spoken euery precept to all the people according to the lawe, takyng the blood of Calues and of Goates, with water & purple wooll and ysope, he sprynkled both the booke it selfe, and all the people,
{9:20} Saying: This is the blood of the testament, whiche God hath enioyned vnto you.
{9:21} And lykewise he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministerie.
{9:22} And almost all thynges are by ye lawe pourged with blood, and without sheddyng of blood is no remission.
{9:23} It is neede then that the paterne of heauenly thynges, be purified with such thynges: but the heauenly thynges the selues (be purified) with better sacrifices then are those.
{9:24} For Christe is not entred into the holy places made with handes (which are) paternes of true thynges: but into heauen it selfe, nowe to appeare in the syght of God for vs.
{9:25} Not that he shoulde offer him selfe often, as the hye priest entreth into the holy places euery yere in strauge blood:
{9:26} (For then must he haue often suffred sence the foundation of the worlde) But nowe once in the ende of the world hath he appeared, to put away sinne, by the sacrifice of hym selfe.
{9:27} And as it is appoynted vnto men once to dye, and after this the iudgement:
{9:28} Euen so, Christe once offered to take away the sinnes of many, the seconde time shalbe seene without sinne, of them which wayte for hym vnto saluation.
{10:1} For the lawe, hauyng the shadow of good thynges to come, and not the very fashion of the thinges the selues, can neuer with those sacrifices whiche they offer yere by yere continually, make the commers therevnto perfect.
{10:2} For woulde not then those sacrifices haue ceassed to haue ben offred, because that the offerers once pourged, shoulde haue had no more conscience of sinnes?
{10:3} Neuerthelesse, in those (sacrifices) is mention made of sinnes euery yere.
{10:4} For it is not possible that the blood of Bulles & of Goates shoulde take away sinnes.
{10:5} Wherfore when he commeth into the worlde, he saith: Sacrifice and offring thou wouldest not haue, but a body hast thou ordeyned me.
{10:6} In burnt sacrifices & sinne (offerynges) thou hast had no pleasure.
{10:7} Then sayde I, lo I come (In the begynnyng of the booke it is written of me) to do thy wyll O God.
{10:8} Aboue when he saith, that sacrifice, and offeryng, and burnt offeringes, and sinne offerynges thou wouldest not, neither haddest pleasure therein (which are offered by the lawe:)
{10:9} Then sayde he, lo I come, to do thy wyll, O God. He taketh away ye first to stablyshe the seconde.
{10:10} In ye which wyll we are made holy, euen by the offeryng of the body of Iesus Christe once for all.
{10:11} And euery priest standeth dayly ministryng, & offeryng oftentymes the same sacrifices, whiche can neuer take away sinnes.
{10:12} But this man, after he hath offered one sacrifice for sinnes, is sit downe for euer on the ryght hande of God:
{10:13} From hencefoorth tarying tyl his foes be made his footstoole.
{10:14} For with one offeryng hath he made perfite for euer them that are sanctified.
{10:15} And the holy ghost also beareth vs recorde: For after that he tolde before,
{10:16} This is the couenaunt that I wyll make vnto them after those dayes, (sayth the Lorde) geuyng my lawes in their heart, and in their myndes wyl I write them:
{10:17} And their sinnes and iniquities wyll I remember no more.
{10:18} And where remission of these thinges is there is no more offering for sinne.
{10:19} Hauyng therefore brethren, libertie to enter into holy places in the blood of Iesus,
{10:20} By the new and lyuing way, which he hath prepared for vs through the vayle, that is to say his flesshe:
{10:21} And seyng we haue an hye priest ouer the house of God:
{10:22} Let vs drawe nye with a true hearte, in assuraunce of fayth, sprinkeled in our heartes from an euyll conscience, and wasshed in body with pure water.
{10:23} Let vs holde the profession of the hope without waueryng, (for he is faythfull that promised:)
{10:24} And let vs consider one another to prouoke vnto loue and good workes,
{10:25} Not forsakyng the assemblyng of our selues together, as the maner of some is but exhortyng one (another) and so much the more, as ye see the day approchyng.
{10:26} For yf we sinne wyllyngly after that we haue receaued the knowledge of the trueth, there remayneth no more sacrifice for sinnes:
{10:27} But a fearefull lokyng for of iudgement, and violent fire, whiche shall deuour the aduersaries.
{10:28} He that despiseth Moyses lawe, dyeth without mercie vnder two or thre witnesses:
{10:29} Of howe muche sorer punyshement (suppose ye) shall he be worthy, whiche treadeth vnder foote the sonne of God? and counteth the blood of the couenaut wherein he was sanctified, an vnholye thyng, and doth despite to the spirite of grace?
{10:30} For we knowe hym that hath sayde, vengeaunce belongeth vnto me, I wyl render saith the Lorde: And agayne, the Lorde shall iudge his people.
{10:31} It is a fearefull thyng to fall into the handes of the lyuyng God.
{10:32} Call to remebraunce the former dayes, in the which after ye had receaued light ye endured a great fyght of aduersities:
{10:33} Partly whyle ye were made a gasing stocke, both by reproches & afflictions, and partly whyle ye became companions of them whiche were so tossed to & fro.
{10:34} For ye suffred also with my bondes, & toke in woorth the spoylyng of your goodes with gladnesse: knowyng in your selues how that ye haue in heauen a better and an enduryng substaunce.
{10:35} Cast not awaye therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of rewarde.
{10:36} For ye haue neede of pacience, that after ye haue done the wyll of God, ye myght receaue the promise.
{10:37} For yet a very litle whyle, and he that shall come, wyll come, and wyll not tary.
{10:38} And the iuste shall lyue by fayth: And yf he withdrawe hym selfe, my soule shall haue no pleasure in hym.
{10:39} We are not of them that withdrawe our selues vnto perdition: but we parteyne vnto fayth, to the wynning of the soule.
{11:1} Fayth is the grounde of thynges hoped for, the euidence of thynges not seene.
{11:2} For by it, the elders obtayned a good report.
{11:3} Through fayth, we vnderstande that the worldes were ordeined by the word of God, and that thynges whiche are seene, were made of thynges whiche were not seene.
{11:4} By fayth Abel offered vnto God a more excellent sacrifice then Cain: by whiche he was witnessed to be ryghteous, God testifiyng of his gyftes: by which also he beyng dead, yet speaketh.
{11:5} By fayth was Enoch translated, that he shoulde not see death, neither was he founde, for God had taken hym away: For afore he was taken away, he was reported of to haue pleased God.
{11:6} But without fayth it is vnpossible to please hym: For he that cometh to God, must beleue that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seeke him.
{11:7} By fayth Noe beyng warned of God of thinges not seene as yet, moued with reuerence, prepared the arke to the sauyng of his house, through the whiche arke he condempned the worlde, and became heire of the righteousnes which is by fayth.
{11:8} By fayth Abraham when he was called, obeyed, to go out into a place whiche he shoulde afterwarde receaue to inheritaunce: and he went out, not knowyng whyther he shoulde go.
{11:9} By fayth he remoued into the lande of promise, as into a straunge countrey, whe he had dwelt in tabernacles, with Isaac and Iacob, heires with hym of the same promise:
{11:10} For he loked for a citie hauyng a foundation, whose buylder and maker is God.
{11:11} Through fayth also Sara her selfe receaued strength to conceaue seede, and was delyuered of a chylde whe she was past age, because she iudged hym faythfull which had promised.
{11:12} And therfore sprang there of one, euen of one whiche was as good as dead so many in multitude, as are the starres in the skye, and as the sande the whiche is by the sea shore innumerable.
{11:13} These all dyed according to fayth, not hauing receaued the promises, but seing them a farre of, and beleuyng, and salutyng, and confessyng that they were straungers and pilgrimes on the earth.
{11:14} For they that saye suche thynges, declare that they seke a countrey.
{11:15} Also yf they had ben myndfull of that countrey from whence they came out, they had leasure to haue returned:
{11:16} But nowe they desire a better, that is, a heauenly. Wherefore God is not ashamed of them to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a citie.
{11:17} By fayth Abraham offered by Isaac when he was proued: and he that had receaued the promises, offered vp his only begotten sonne:
{11:18} To whom it was saide, that in Isaac shall thy seede be called.
{11:19} For he considered that God was able to rayse the dead vp agayne, fro whence also he receaued hym in a similitude of the resurrection.
{11:20} By fayth did Isaac blesse Iacob and Esau, concernyng thynges to come.
{11:21} By fayth Iacob when he was a dying, blessed both the sonnes of Ioseph, and worshypped towarde the toppe of his scepter.
{11:22} By fayth Ioseph when he dyed, remembred the departyng of the chyldren of Israel, and gaue commaundement of his bones.
{11:23} By fayth Moyses whe he was borne, was hyd three monethes of his father and mother, because they sawe he was a proper chylde, neither feared they the kynges commaundement.
{11:24} By fayth Moyses when he was great, refused to be called the sonne of Pharaos daughter:
{11:25} Chosyng rather to suffer aduersitie with the people of God, then to enioye the pleasures of sinne for a season:
{11:26} Esteemyng the rebuke of Christ, greater riches, then the treasures of Egypt: For he had respect vnto the recompence of the rewarde.
{11:27} By fayth he forsoke Egypt, fearyng not the wrath of the kyng: For he endured, euen as though he had seene him which is inuisible.
{11:28} Through fayth, he ordeyned the Passouer and the effusion of blood, lest he that destroyed the first borne, shoulde touche them.
{11:29} By fayth, they passed through the redde sea, as by drye lande: which the Egyptians assaying to do, were drowned.
{11:30} By fayth, the walles of Iericho fell downe, after they were compassed about seuen dayes.
{11:31} By fayth, the harlot Rahab perished not with them that were disobedient, when she had receaued the spyes with peace.
{11:32} And what shall I more say? for the tyme woulde fayle me, to rehearse of Gedeon, of Barac, and of Sampson, and of Iephte, of Dauid also and Samuel, and of the prophetes:
{11:33} Which through faith subdued kingdomes, wrought righteousnesse, obteyned the promises, stopped the mouthes of the Lions,
{11:34} Quenched the violence of fyre, escaped the edge of the sworde, out of weakenesse were made strong, wared valiant in fyght, turned to flyght the armies of the aliantes.
{11:35} The women receaued their dead, raysed to lyfe agayne: Other were racked, not lokyng for deliueraunce, that they might receaue a better resurrectio.
{11:36} And others were tryed with mockynges, and scourgynges: Yea, moreouer with bondes and prisonment:
{11:37} They were stoned, were hewen asunder, were tempted, were slaine with sword, wandred about in sheepskinnes, and goates skinnes, beyng destitute, afflicted and tormented:
{11:38} Of who the worlde was not worthie: They wandred in wildernesse, and in mountaynes, and in dennes, and caues of the earth.
{11:39} And these all through fayth, obteyned good report, and receaued not the promise:
{11:40} God prouidyng a better thyng for vs, that they without vs shoulde not be made perfect.
{12:1} Wherfore, seyng that we are compassed with so great a cloude of witnesses, lay away all that presseth downe, & the sinne that hangeth so fast on, let vs run with patience vnto the battayle that is set before vs:
{12:2} Lokyng vnto Iesus, the captayne and finissher of our fayth, which for the ioy that was set before hym, endured the crosse, hauyng dispised the shame, and is set downe on the ryght hande of the throne of God.
{12:3} Consider therfore hym that endured such speakyng agaynst hym of sinners, lest you shoulde be weryed, fayntyng in your myndes.
{12:4} Ye haue not yet resisted vnto blood, stryuyng agaynst sinne.
{12:5} And ye haue forgotten the exhortatio, which speaketh vnto you as vnto chyldren: My sonne despise not thou the chastenyng of the Lorde, neither faynt when thou art rebuked of hym:
{12:6} For whom the Lord loueth, he chasteneth, and scourgeth euery sonne that he receaueth.
{12:7} If ye endure chastenyng, God offereth him selfe as vnto sonnes: For what sonne is he whom the father chasteneth not?
{12:8} But yf ye be without chastisment, wherof all are partakers, then are ye bastardes, and not sonnes.
{12:9} Furthermore, we haue had fathers of our fleshe, which corrected vs, and we gaue them reuerence: Shall we not then much rather be in subiection vnto the father of spirites, and lyue?
{12:10} For they veryly, for a fewe dayes, chastened vs after their owne pleasure: but he, for our profite, that we myght be partakers of his holynesse.
{12:11} No chashsyng for the present seemeth to be ioyous, but greeuous: Neuerthelesse, afterwarde it bryngeth the quiet fruite of ryghteousnesse, vnto the which are exercised therby.
{12:12} Strayghten vp therfore the handes which were let downe, and the weake knees:
{12:13} And make ryght steppes vnto your feete, lest that which is haltyng, turne you out of the way: but let it rather be healed.
{12:14} Folowe peace with all men, and holynesse, without the which, no man shall see the Lorde:
{12:15} Takyng heede that no man fall away from the grace of God, lest any roote of bitternesse spryngyng vp, trouble you, and therby many be defyled.
{12:16} Let there be no fornicator or vncleane person, as Esau, which for one morsell of meate, solde his birthryght.
{12:17} For ye knowe, howe that afterwarde when he woulde haue inherited the blessyng, he was reprobated: For he founde no place of repentaunce, though he sought it with teares.
{12:18} For ye are not come vnto the mount that is touched, & vnto burnyng fyre, and vnto storme and darkenesse, and tempestes of weather,
{12:19} And sounde of a trompe, & the voyce of wordes: which voyce they that heard it, wisshed away, that the worde should not be spoken to them:
{12:20} (For they dyd not abyde that which was commaunded. If a beast touche the mountaine, it shalbe stoned, or thrust through with a darte.
{12:21} And so terrible was the syght which appeared, that Moyses sayde, I feare and quake.)
{12:22} But ye are come vnto ye mount Sion, and to the citie of the lyuyng God, the celestiall Hierusalem, and to an innumerable companie of Angels,
{12:23} And vnto the congregation of the first borne, written in heauen, and to God the iudge of all, and to the spirites of iust and perfect men:
{12:24} And to Iesus the mediatour of the newe couenaunt, and to the blood of sprinklyng, that speaketh better then that of Abel.
{12:25} See that ye despise not hym that speaketh: For yf they escaped not, which refused hym that spake on earth: much more shall we not escape yf we turne away from hym that speaketh from heauen:
{12:26} Whose voyce then shoke the earth, & nowe hath declared, saying: Yet once more wyll I shake, not the earth only, but also heauen.
{12:27} And this yet once more signifieth remouyng of those thynges which are shaken, as of thynges which are made: that the thynges which are not shaken, may remayne.
{12:28} Wherfore, we receauyng a kingdome which can not be moued, let vs haue grace, wherby we may so serue God acceptablie, with reuerence & godly feare.
{12:29} For our God is a consumyng fyre.
{13:1} Let brotherly loue continue.
{13:2} Be not forgetfull to lodge straungers: For therby some hauyng lodged Angels, were vnawares therof.
{13:3} Remember them that are in bondes, as bounde with them: And them which suffer aduersitie, as also ye your selues beyng in the body suffered aduersitie.
{13:4} Wedlocke is honorable among all men, and the bed vndefiled: But whoremongers and adulterers God wyll iudge.
{13:5} Let your conuersation be without couetousnesse, beyng content with such thynges as ye haue. For he hath sayde: I wyll not fayle thee, neither forsake thee.
{13:6} So that we may boldely saye, the Lorde is my helper, and I wyll not feare what man way do vnto me.
{13:7} Remember them which haue the ouersyght of you, which haue spoken vnto you the worde of God: Whose ende of conuersation ye consideryng, folowe their fayth.
{13:8} Iesus Christe yesterday and to day, and the same for euer.
{13:9} Be not caryed about with diuers & strange doctrines: For it is a good thing that the heart be stablisshed with grace, & not with meates, which haue not profited the that haue ben occupied therin.
{13:10} We haue an aulter, wherof they haue no ryght to eate which serue in the tabernacle.
{13:11} For the bodyes of those beastes whose blood is brought into the holy place by the hie priest for sinne, are burnt without the tentes.
{13:12} Therfore Iesus also, that he myght sanctifie ye people with his owne blood, suffered without the gate.
{13:13} Let vs go foorth therfore vnto hym out of the tentes, bearyng his reproche.
{13:14} For here haue we no continuyng citie: but we seke one to come.
{13:15} By hym therfore, do we offer sacrifice of laude alwayes to God: that is, the fruite of lippes confessyng his name.
{13:16} To do good & to distribute forget not, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
{13:17} Obey them that haue the ouersight of you, and submit your selues: for they watche for your soules, as they that must geue accomptes, that they may do it with ioy, and not with griefe: for that is vnprofitable for you.
{13:18} Pray for vs: For we trust we haue a good conscience, in all thynges wyllyng to lyue honestlie.
{13:19} But I desire you the more earnestlie that ye so do, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
{13:20} The God of peace, that brought agayne from the dead our Lorde Iesus the great sheephearde of the sheepe, through the blood of the euerlasting couenaunt,
{13:21} Make you perfect in all good workes to do his wyll, workyng in you that which is pleasaunt in his sight, through Iesus Christe, to whom be prayse for euer and euer. Amen.
{13:22} And I beseche you brethren, suffer the worde of exhortation: for I haue written vnto you in fewe wordes.
{13:23} Knowe ye, that brother Timothe is delyuered: With whom (yf he come shortly) I wyll see you.
{13:24} Salute all them that haue the ouersight of you, and all the saintes. They of Italie salute you.
{13:25} Grace be with you all. Amen. Written from Italie by Timotheus.
