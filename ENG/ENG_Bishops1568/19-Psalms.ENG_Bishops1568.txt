{1:1} Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsell of the vngodly: nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seate of the scornefull.
{1:2} But his delight is in the lawe of God: and in God his lawe exerciseth himselfe day and night.
{1:3} And he shalbe lyke a tree planted by the waters syde, that bryngeth foorth her fruite in due season: and whose leafe wythereth not, for whatsoeuer he doth it shall prosper.
{1:4} As for the vngodly it is not so with them: but they are like the chaffe which the winde scattereth abrode.
{1:5} Therefore the vngodly shall not be able to stande in the iudgement: neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
{1:6} For God knoweth the way of the righteous: and the way of the vngodly shall perishe.
{2:1} Why do the Heathen so furiously rage together? and why do the people imagine a vayne thing?
{2:2} The kynges of the earth stande vp: and the rulers take counsell together against god, and against his annointed.
{2:3} Let vs breake say they their bondes a sunder: and cast away their cordes from vs.
{2:4} He that dwelleth in heauen wyll laugh them to scorne: the Lorde wyll haue them in derision.
{2:5} Then wyll he speake vnto them in his wrath: and he wyll astonie them with feare in his sore displeasure.
{2:6} Saying euen I haue annointed him my kyng: vpon my holy hyll of Sion.
{2:7} I wyll declare the decree, God sayde vnto me: thou art my sonne, this day I haue begotten thee.
{2:8} Desire of me, and I wyll geue thee the heathen for thyne inheritaunce: and the vttermost partes of the earth for thy possession.
{2:9} Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron: and breake them in peeces like a potters vessell.
{2:10} Wherfore be you nowe wel aduised O ye kinges: be you learned ye that are iudges of the earth.
{2:11} Serue ye God in feare: and reioyce ye with a trembling.
{2:12} Kisse ye the sonne lest that he be angrye, and so ye perishe from the way, if his wrath be neuer so litle kindled: blessed are all they that put their trust in hym.
{3:1} A psalme of Dauid when he fled from the face of Absalom his sonne. O God howe are myne enemies increased? many do ryse vp against me.
{3:2} Many say of my soule: there is no saluation for it in God. Selah.
{3:3} But thou O God art a buckler for me: thou art my worship, and the lifter vp of my head.
{3:4} I dyd call vpon God with my voyce, and he hearde me out of his holy hyll. Selah.
{3:5} I layde me downe and slept: and I rose vp agayne, for God sustayned me.
{3:6} I wyll not be afrayde of ten thousandes of the people: that haue set them selues against me rounde about.
{3:7} Arise vp O God, saue thou me O my Lorde: for thou hast smitten all myne enemies vpon the cheeke bone, thou hast broken the teeth of the vngodly.
{3:8} Saluation is of God: thy blessing is vpon thy people. Selah.
{4:1} To the chiefe musition on Neginoth, a psalme of Dauid. Heare me when I call O God of my righteousnesse: thou hast set me at libertie when I was in distresse.
{4:2} O ye sonnes of men, how long wyll ye go about to bryng my glory to confusion? ye loue vanitie, ye seeke after lyes. Selah.
{4:3} For ye must know that God hath chosen to him selfe a godly man: God wyl heare when I call vnto hym.
{4:4} Be ye angry, but sinne not: commune with your owne heart in your chaumber, and be styll. Selah.
{4:5} Offer the sacrifice of righteousnesse: and put your trust in God.
{4:6} There be many that say, who wyll shewe vs any good? O God lift thou vp the light of thy countenaunce vpon vs.
{4:7} Thou hast put gladnesse in my heart: since the time that their corne and wine increased.
{4:8} I wyll lay me downe in peace and take my rest: for thou God only makest me to dwell in safetie.
{5:1} To the chiefe musition vpon Nehiloth, a psalme of Dauid. Geue eare vnto my wordes O God: vnderstande thou my pensifnesse.
{5:2} Hearken thou vnto the voyce of my crying my kyng and my Lorde: for vnto thee I wyll make my prayer.
{5:3} Thou shalt heare my voyce betymes O God: I wyll early in the morning direct a prayer vnto thee, and I wyll looke for helpe from thee.
{5:4} For thou art the Lorde that hath no pleasure in wickednesse: neither can any euyll dwell with thee.
{5:5} Suche as be foolishe, can not stande in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquitie.
{5:6} Thou wilt destroy them that make a lye: God wyll abhorre both the bloodthirstie and deceiptfull man.
{5:7} As for me I wyll come into thyne house, trusting in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy feare I will humble my selfe in thyne holy temple.
{5:8} Leade me O God in thy righteousnesse, because of myne enemies: make thy way playne before my face.
{5:9} For no trueth is in their mouth, their inwarde partes are very wickednesse: their throte is an open sepulchre, they flatter with their tongue.
{5:10} Destroy thou them O Lord, let them perishe through their owne counsailes: cast them out in the multitude of their vngodlinesse, for they haue rebelled against thee.
{5:11} And all they that trust in thee wyll reioyce, they wyll triumph for euer, because thou defendest them: and they that loue thy name, wyll be ioyfull in thee.
{5:12} For thou O God wylt blesse the righteous: and thou wylt compasse hym about with beneuolence, as with a shielde.
{6:1} To the chiefe musition on Neginoth vpon eyght, a psalme of Dauid. O God rebuke me not in thine indignation: neither chasten me in thy wrath.
{6:2} Haue mercy on me O God, for I am weake: O God heale me, for my bones be very sore.
{6:3} My soule also is greatly troubled: but O God howe long shall I be in this case?
{6:4} Turne thee O God, and deliuer my soule: Oh saue me for thy mercies sake.
{6:5} For in death no man remembreth thee: and in the graue who can acknowledge thee?
{6:6} I am weerie of my groning: I washe my bed euery nyght, and I water my coutche with my teares.
{6:7} Mine eye is almost put out through griefe: and worne out through all mine enemies.
{6:8} Away from me all workers of iniquitie: for God hath hearde the voyce of my weeping.
{6:9} God hath hearde my petition: God wyll receaue my prayer.
{6:10} All myne enemies shalbe confounded and sore vexed: they shalbe turned backe, they shalbe put to shame sodainlye.
{7:1} Siggaion of Dauid, whiche he song vnto God in the busines of Chus, the sonne of Iemini. O God my Lord, in thee I haue put my trust: saue me from all them that do persecute me, and deliuer thou me.
{7:2} Lest he like a Lion seasoneth on my soule: teareth it in peeces, hauyng no rescue.
{7:3} O God my Lord, if I haue done any such thing: or if there be any wickednesse in my handes.
{7:4} If I haue done euyll vnto hym that had peace with me: and if I haue not deliuered hym that is without a cause myne aduersarie?
{7:5} Then let myne enemie persecute my soule and take me: yea, let hym put me to death, and lay myne honour in the dust. Selah.
{7:6} Arise O God in thy wrath, and stand thou vp agaynst the rage of myne enemies: stirre thou for me according to the iudgement whiche thou hast geuen.
{7:7} And so shall the congregation of the people come about thee: for their sakes therfore place thy selfe on high.
{7:8} God wyll iudge the people: geue thou sentence with me O God according to my righteousnesse, and according to my perfection that is within me.
{7:9} My desire is, that ye wickednesse of the vngodly may come to an ende: and that thou wouldest assist the iust, who art the tryer of heartes and of reynes, O most righteous Lorde.
{7:10} My buckler is with God: who preserueth them that be vpright in heart.
{7:11} The Lorde is a righteous iudge: and the Lorde is prouoked to anger euery day.
{7:12} If the wicked wyll not turne, he wyll whet his sworde: bende his bowe, and haue it in a redinesse to shoote
{7:13} He hath prepared hym instrumentes of death: he hath ordayned his arrowes agaynst them that be persecutors.
{7:14} Beholde, he wyll be in trauayle of a mischiefe, for he hath conceaued a labour: but yet he shall be brought to bed of a falsehood.
{7:15} He hath made a graue and digged it: but he hym selfe wyll fall into the pit whiche he hath made.
{7:16} For his labour shall come vpon his owne head: and his wickednesse shall fall vpon his owne pate.
{7:17} I wyll prayse God accordyng to his ryghteousnesse: & I wyll sing psalmes vnto the name of the most high God.
{8:1} To the chiefe musition vpon Gittith, a psalme of Dauid. O God our Lorde, howe excellent is thy name in all the earth? for that thou hast set thy glory aboue the heauens.
{8:2} Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklinges thou hast layde the foundation of thy strength for thyne aduersaries sake: that thou mightest styll the enemie and the auenger.
{8:3} For I will consider thy heauens, euen the workes of thy fingers: the moone and the starres whiche thou hast ordayned.
{8:4} What is man that thou art myndfull of him? and the sonne of man that thou visitest hym?
{8:5} Thou hast made hym somthyng inferiour to angels: thou hast crowned him with glory and worship.
{8:6} Thou makest hym to haue dominion of the workes of thy handes: and thou hast put all thinges in subiection vnder his feete,
{8:7} All sheepe and oxen, & also the beastes of the fielde:
{8:8} (8:7) the foules of the ayre, and the fishe of the sea, and whatsoeuer swymmeth in the seas.
{8:9} (8:8) O God our Lorde: howe excellent great is thy name in all the earth?
{9:1} To the chiefe musition at the death of Labben, a psalme of Dauid. I wyl prayse God with all myne heart: I wyl recite all thy marueylous workes.
{9:2} I wyll be glad & reioyce in thee: I wyll sing psalmes vnto thy name, O thou most hyest.
{9:3} For that myne enemies are returned backwarde: are fallen and perished at thy presence.
{9:4} For that thou hast geuen iudgement in my ryght and cause: thou that iudgest right, hast sit in the throne of iudgement.
{9:5} Thou hast rebuked the Heathen, and destroyed the vngodly: thou hast abolished their name for euer and euer.
{9:6} O thou enemie thou thoughtest to bryng vs to a perpetuall desolation: and to destroy our cities, so that there shoulde remayne no memory of them.
{9:7} But God wyll sit for euer: he hath prepared his throne for iudgement.
{9:8} For he wyll iudge the world in iustice: and minister iudgement vnto the people in righteousnesse.
{9:9} God also wyll be a refuge for the oppressed: euen a refuge in tyme of trouble.
{9:10} And they that knowe thy name wyll put their trust in thee: for thou O God hast neuer fayled them that seeke thee.
{9:11} Sing psalmes vnto God abiding at Sion: declare his notable actes among the people.
{9:12} For he maketh inquisition of blood: he remembreth it, and forgetteth not the complaynt of the poore.
{9:13} Haue mercy on me O God: consider the trouble whiche I suffer of them that hate me, lift me vp from the gates of death.
{9:14} That I may shewe all thy prayses within the gates of the daughter of Sion: and reioyce in thy saluation.
{9:15} The Heathen are sunke downe into the pit that they made: their owne foote is snared in the same net whiche they had layde priuily for other.
{9:16} God is knowen by the iudgement that he hath executed: the vngodly is trapped in ye worke of his owne handes, this ought to be considered alwayes. Selah.
{9:17} The wicked shalbe turned vnto hell: and all people that forget God.
{9:18} But the poore shall not alway be forgotten: neither shall the hope of the humble afflicted, perishe for euer.
{9:19} Aryse vp O God, let not man preuaile: let the Heathen in thy sight be iudged.
{9:20} Put them in feare O God: that the Heathen may knowe them selues to be but men. Selah.
{10:1} Why standest thou so farre of O God? why hidest thee in the tyme of trouble?
{10:2} The vngodly of a wylfulnesse persecuteth the poore: but euery one of them shalbe taken in the craftie wylines that they haue imagined.
{10:3} For the vngodly prayseth according to his owne heartes desire: and blessing the couetous, he blasphemeth God.
{10:4} The vngodly looketh so proudly as though he cared for none at all: neither is the Lorde in all his thoughtes.
{10:5} His wayes are alwayes greeuous, but thy iudgementes are farre aboue out of his sight: and therfore he snuffeth at all his enemies.
{10:6} He hath sayde in his heart, tushe, I can not be remoued: for I can not be touched at any tyme with harme.
{10:7} His mouth is full of cursing, and of deceate, and of fraude: vnder his tongue is labour and mischiefe.
{10:8} He sitteth lurkyng in theeuishe corners of the streates: and priuily in lurking dennes he doth murther the innocent, he eyeth diligently hym that is weake.
{10:9} He lieth in wayte lurking as a Lion in his denne: he lyeth in wayte lurkyng, that he may violently carry away the afflicted, he doth carry away violentlye the afflicted, in halyng hym into his net.
{10:10} He croucheth and humbleth him selfe: so that a number of the that be weake, fall by his myght.
{10:11} He sayeth in his heart, tushe, the Lord hath forgotten: he hydeth away his face, and he wyll neuer see it.
{10:12} Aryse vp O Lorde God: lift vp thine hande, forget not the afflicted.
{10:13} Wherefore shoulde the wicked blaspheme the Lorde: whyle he sayeth in his heart, that thou wylt not call to accompt?
{10:14} Surely thou hast seene this for thou beholdest labour and spite: that thou mayest take the matter into thy hands, he that is weake leaueth it for thee, for thou art the helper of the fatherlesse.
{10:15} Breake thou the power of the vngodly and malitious: searche thou out his vngodlynes, and thou shalt finde none afterwarde in him.
{10:16} God is king for euer and euer: but the Heathen shall perishe out of the lande.
{10:17} O God, thou hast hearde the desire of the afflicted: and thou wylt settle their heart.
{10:18} Thou wylt be attentiue with thyne eare, to geue iudgement for the fatherlesse and oppressed: so no man in the earth shall once go about hereafter to do them violence.
{11:1} To the chiefe musition, a psalme of Dauid. In God I put my trust: howe say ye then to my soule, that she shoulde flee as a byrde from your hyll.
{11:2} For lo, the vngodly haue bende their bowe: and nocked their arrowes with the string, redy to shoote priuily at them whiche are vpright in heart.
{11:3} For if the foundations shalbe caste downe: what must the righteous do?
{11:4} But God is in his holy temple, Gods throne is in heauen: his eyes looke downe, his eye liddes tryeth the chyldren of men.
{11:5} God wyll trye the righteous: but his soule abhorreth the vngodly, and hym that delighteth in wickednes.
{11:6} Upon ye vngodly he wyl rayne snares, fire and brimstone: and tempestious stormes shalbe their portion to drinke.
{11:7} For God most righteous, loueth righteousnes: his countenaunce wyll beholde the iust.
{12:1} To the chiefe musition vpon (an instrument) of eyght stringes, a psalme of Dauid. Saue thou me O God, for there is not one godly man left: for the faythfull are diminished from among the chyldren of men.
{12:2} Euery one vseth vayne talke with his neyghbour: and speaketh with a double heart out of flatteryng lippes.
{12:3} God wyll cut away all flatteryng lippes: and the tongue that speaketh great thinges.
{12:4} Whiche say, we wyll preuayle with our tongue: our lippes are our owne, who is Lorde ouer vs?
{12:5} For the calamities of the oppressed, for the deepe sighyng of the poore, I wyll nowe vp sayeth God: and I wyll put in safetie, hym whom the wicked hath snared.
{12:6} The wordes of God be wordes pure, as the siluer tryed in a furnace of earth: and purified seuen times.
{12:7} Wherfore thou wylt kepe the godly, O God: thou wylt preserue euery one of them from this generation for euer.
{12:8} The vngodly walke on euery side: when the worst sort be exalted amongst the chyldren of men.
{13:1} To the chiefe musition, a Psalme of Dauid. Howe long wylt thou forget me O God, for euer? howe long wilt thou hyde thy face from me?
{13:2} Howe long shall I seke counsayle in my soule, and be so vexed in mine heart euery day? howe long shall myne enemie triumph ouer me?
{13:3} Loke downe and heare me O God my Lorde: lighten myne eyes, lest that I sleepe in death.
{13:4} Lest myne enemie say, I haue preuayled agaynst hym: lest they that trouble me reioyce yf I shoulde be remoued.
{13:5} But I repose my trust in thy mercie, and my heart is ioyfull in thy saluation:
{13:6} (13:5) I wyll syng to God, because he hath rewarded me.
{14:1} To the chiefe musition, a Psalme of Dauid. The foole hath sayde in his heart there is no God: they haue corrupted them selues and done an abhominable worke, there is not one that doth good.
{14:2} God loked downe from heauen vpon the children of men: to see yf there were any that did vnderstande and seke after the Lorde.
{14:3} But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abhominable: there is none that doth good, no not one.
{14:4} Do not all the workers of iniquitie know, deuouryng my people as though they deuoured bread: that they call not vpon God?
{14:5} Hereafter they shalbe taken with a great feare: for the Lorde is in the generation of the righteous.
{14:6} As for nowe ye make a mocke at the counsayle of the poore: because he reposeth his trust in God.
{14:7} Who shall geue saluation vnto Israel: out of Sion? (14:8) When God will deliuer his people out of captiuitie: then wyll Iacob reioyce, and Israel be glad.
{15:1} O God, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? who shall rest vppon thy holy hyll?
{15:2} Euen he that leadeth an vncorrupt life: and doth the thyng that is iust, and speaketh the trueth from his heart.
{15:3} He that backbyteth not with his tongue: nor doth any euil to his felowe, nor rayseth a slaunder vpon his neyghbour.
{15:4} He that dispiseth in his eyes the reprobate: and honoureth them that feare God. (15:5) He that hath sworne to his owne hurt: and yet wyll not go from his oth.
{15:5} (15:6) He that geueth not his money vpon vsurie: nor taketh rewarde agaynst the innocent. (15:7) He that doth these thynges: shall neuer at any tyme be remoued.
{16:1} The golden psalme of Dauid. Preserue me O Lorde: for I haue reposed my trust in thee.
{16:2} Thou hast sayde O my soule vnto God, thou art my Lorde: my weldoing can do thee no good.
{16:3} But all my delyght is to do good vnto the saintes that are in the earth: and vnto such as excell in vertue.
{16:4} As for them that runne after another God they shall haue great trouble: I wyll not offer their drynke offerynges of blood, neither wyll I make mention of their names within my lyppes.
{16:5} O God, thou thy selfe art the portion of myne inheritaunce and of my cup: thou wylt mayntayne my lot.
{16:6} My lot is fallen vnto me in a pleasaut grounde: I haue a goodly heritage.
{16:7} I wyll prayse God who gaue me counsayle: my reines also do instruct me in the nyght season.
{16:8} I haue set God alwayes before me: for he is on my ryght hande, therfore I shall not be remoued.
{16:9} Wherfore my heart is glad: my glory reioyceth, my fleshe also shall rest in a securitie.
{16:10} For thou wylt not leaue my soule in hell: neither wylt thou suffer thyne holy one to see corruption.
{16:11} Thou wylt cause me to knowe the path of lyfe: in thy presence is the fulnesse of ioy, and at thy right hand there be pleasures for euermore.
{17:1} A prayer of Dauid. Heare thou O God of iustice, be attentiue vnto my complaynt: geue eare vnto my prayer, not proceeding out of fayned lyppes.
{17:2} Let iudgement come foorth for me from thy face: and let thine eyes loke vpon equitie.
{17:3} Thou hast proued myne heart, thou hast visited it in the nyght season: thou hast tryed me, and founde no wickednesse, for I purposed that nothyng shoulde scape my mouth.
{17:4} As touchyng other mens workes: through the wordes of thy lyppes I haue kept me from the way of the violent.
{17:5} O holde thou vp my goynges in thy pathes: that my footesteppes slyp not.
{17:6} I call vpon thee O God, for thou wilt heare me: incline thine eare to me, hearken vnto my wordes.
{17:7} Shewe thy marueylous louyng kindnesse: thou that art the sauiour of them that trust in thee, from such as ryse vp agaynst thy ryght hande.
{17:8} Kepe me as the apple of an eye, hyde me vnder the shadowe of thy wynges: from the face of the vngodly that go about to destroy me, from myne enemies that compasse me rounde about to take away my soule.
{17:9} They haue inclosed them selues in their owne fat: with their mouth they speake proude thynges.
{17:10} They haue nowe compassed me on euery syde where our way lyeth: they toote with their eyes to ouerthrow me downe on the grounde.
{17:11} His doynges be lyke a lions that is greedy to take a pray: and as a lions whelpe lurkyng in secrete places.
{17:12} Aryse O God, preuent his commyng, make hym to bowe: delyuer thou my soule from the vngodly which is thy sworde.
{17:13} Deliuer thou me O God from men which be thy hande: from men, from the worlde, whose portion is in this lyfe, whose bellyes thou fyllest with thy priuie treasure.
{17:14} Whose children haue aboundaunce: & they leaue enough of that they haue remaynyng to their babes.
{17:15} But as for me, I will beholde thy face in ryghteousnesse: I shalbe satisfied when I awake vp after thy lykenesse.
{18:1} To the chiefe musition the seruaunt of God, and of Dauid who spake vnto God the wordes of this song in the day that God deliuered him from the hande of all his enemies, and from the hande of Saul: And he sayde. I wyll entirely loue thee O God my strength,
{18:2} (18:1) God is my stony rocke & my fortresse, and my delyuerer: my Lorde, my castell in whom I wyll trust, my buckler, the horne of my saluation, & my refuge.
{18:3} (18:2) I wyll call vpon God, who is most worthy to be praysed: so I shall be safe from myne enemies.
{18:4} (18:3) The panges of death haue compassed me about: and the outragiousnes of the wicked haue astonyed me with feare.
{18:5} (18:4) The panges of a graue haue compassed me about: the snares of death ouertoke me.
{18:6} (18:5) But in this my distresse I dyd call vppon God, and I made my complaynt vnto my Lorde: he hearde my voyce out of his temple, and my crye came before his face, euen vnto his eares.
{18:7} (18:6) The earth trembled and quaked: the very foundations of the hylles tottered and shooke, because he was wroth.
{18:8} (18:7) In his anger a smoke ascended vp: and a fire out of his mouth dyd cosume, and euery cole therof dyd set a fire.
{18:9} (18:8) He bowed the heauens also, and he came downe: and it was darke vnder his feete.
{18:10} (18:9) He ridde vpon the Cherub, and he dyd flee: he came fleeyng vpon the wynges of the wynde.
{18:11} (18:10) For his secrete place he dyd put darkenesse: and for his pauilion rounde about hym, he dyd put darknesse of waters in cloudes of the ayre.
{18:12} (18:11) His cloudes, haylestones, and coles of fire: fell downe before hym after lyghtnyng.
{18:13} (18:12) God also thundred out of heauen: and the most hyghest made his voyce to sounde, haylestones, and coles of fire.
{18:14} (18:13) He shot out his arrowes, and scattered them: he cast foorth much lyghtnynges, and destroyed them.
{18:15} (18:14) And the bottomes of waters appeared, and the foundations of the rounde worlde were discouered at thy chidyng, O God: at the blast of the breath of thine anger.
{18:16} (18:15) He hath sent downe from aboue to fetch me: he hath taken me out of many waters.
{18:17} (18:16) He hath deliuered me from my strong enemie: and from them which hate me, for they were to stout for me.
{18:18} (18:17) They preuented me in the day of my trouble: but God was vnto me a sure stay.
{18:19} (18:18) He brought me also foorth into a place of libertie: he brought me foorth, because he had a fauour vnto me.
{18:20} (18:19) God rewarded me after my righteous dealyng: accordyng to the cleannesse of myne handes he recompensed me.
{18:21} (18:20) Because I had kept the wayes of God: and had not wickedly shronke from my God.
{18:22} (18:21) For all his lawes were before me: and I reiected none of his commaundementes from me.
{18:23} (18:22) And I was sounde & pure towardes hym: and I was weery lest I shoulde offende hym with my wickednesse.
{18:24} (18:23) Therfore hath God rewarded me after my righteous dealyng: and accordyng to my cleannesse of my handes in his syght.
{18:25} (18:24) With the holy thou wylt be holy: with a perfect man thou wylt be perfect.
{18:26} (18:25) With the cleane thou wylt be cleane: and with the frowarde thou wylt be frowarde.
{18:27} (18:26) For thou hast saued the people oppressed: and thou hast brought downe the hygh lokes of the proude.
{18:28} (18:27) Thou also hast lyghtened my candell: God my Lorde hath made my darknesse to be lyght.
{18:29} (18:28) For in thee I haue discomfited an hoast of men: and with the helpe of my Lorde I haue skipped ouer the wall.
{18:30} (18:29) The way of the Lorde is a perfect way, the worde of God is tryed in the fire: he is a shielde vnto all them that put their trust in hym.
{18:31} (18:30) For who is a Lorde besides God: or who hath any strength besides our Lorde?
{18:32} (18:31) It is God that hath gyrded me with valiauntnesse of warre: and he hath made my way playne.
{18:33} (18:32) He hath made my feete lyke Hartes feete: and he hath set me vp on hygh.
{18:34} (18:33) He hath taught my handes to fyght: and myne armes to breake a bowe of steele.
{18:35} (18:34) Thou hast geuen me the shielde of thy saluation: thy ryght hande also hath helde me vp, and through thy great gentlenesse I haue increased.
{18:36} (18:35) Thou hast made me roomth inough for to go on: so that my feete haue not slypt.
{18:37} (18:36) I haue pursued myne enemies and onertaken them: neither dyd I returne backe vntyll I had destroyed them.
{18:38} (18:37) I smote them downe, and they are not able to aryse: they haue taken such a fall vnder my feete.
{18:39} (18:38) Thou hast gyrded me with strength vnto battayle: thou hast made them to bowe downe vnder me who haue rysen vp agaynst me.
{18:40} (18:39) Thou hast geuen me myne enemies neckes: and I haue destroyed them that hated me.
{18:41} (18:40) They cryed, but there was none to saue them: they cryed vnto God, but he dyd not heare them.
{18:42} (18:41) I dyd beat them to powder, like vnto dust in a wynde: I haue brought them as lowe as durt in the streates.
{18:43} (18:42) Thou hast deliuered me from sedition of the people, and thou hast made me head of the heathen: a people whom I haue not knowen serueth me,
{18:44} (18:42) assoone as they hearde of me, they obeyed me.
{18:45} (18:43) Children of a straunger haue made a lie vnto me: the heartes of the children of a straunger hath fayled them, and they feared in their strong holdes.
{18:46} (18:44) God lyueth, and he is my strength most worthy of blisse: and the Lorde of my saluation ought to be magnified.
{18:47} (18:45) It is God that hath geuen me power to take auengeaunce: and he hath subdued the people vnder me.
{18:48} (18:46) It is he that is the aucthour of my deliuerie from myne enemies: and he hath set me vp aboue them that rose agaynst me, he hath ridde me from the wicked man.
{18:49} (18:47) For this cause I wyll acknowledge thee O God among the gentiles: and syng psalmes vnto thy name.
{18:50} (18:48) Who hath wonderfull oft deliuered his kyng: and he hath done mercifully vnto Dauid his annoynted, and vnto his seede for euermore.
{19:1} To the chiefe musition, a psalme of Dauid. The heauens declare the glorie of God: and the firmament sheweth his handy worke.
{19:2} A day occasioneth talke therof vnto a day: and a night teacheth knoweledge vnto a nyght.
{19:3} No language, no wordes, no voyce of theirs is hearde:
{19:4} (19:3) yet their sounde goeth into all landes, and their wordes into the endes of the worlde.(19:4) In them he hath set a tabernacle for the sunne:
{19:5} (19:4) which commeth foorth as a bridegrome out of his chamber, and reioyceth as a giaunt to runne his course.
{19:6} (19:5) His settyng foorth is from the vtmost part of heauen, and his circuite vnto the vtmost part therof: and there is nothing hyd from his heat.
{19:7} (19:6) The lawe of God is perfect, conuerting the soule: the testimonie of God is sure, and geueth wisdome vnto the simple.
{19:8} (19:7) The statutes of God are right, and reioyce the heart: the commaundement of God is pure, and geueth light vnto the eyes.
{19:9} (19:8) The feare of God is sincere, & endureth for euer: the iudgementes of God are trueth, they be iust in all poyntes.
{19:10} (19:9) They are more to be desired then golde, yea then much fine golde: they are also sweeter then hony and the hony combe.
{19:11} (19:10) Moreouer, by them thy seruaunt is well aduertised: and in kepyng of them there is a great rewarde.
{19:12} (19:11) Who can knowe his owne errours? Oh cleanse thou me from those that I am not priuie of.
{19:13} (19:12) Kepe thy seruaunt also from presumptuous sinnes let them not raigne ouer me: so I shall be perfect & voyde from all haynous offence.
{19:14} (19:13) Let the wordes of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight O God: my strength and my redeemer.
{20:1} To the chiefe musition, a psalme of Dauid. God heare thee in the day of trouble: the name of the Lorde of Iacob defende thee.
{20:2} Let him sende thee helpe from the sanctuarie: and ayde thee out of Sion.
{20:3} Let him remember all thy offeringes: and turne into asshes thy burnt sacrifices. Selah.
{20:4} Let him graunt thee thy heartes desire: and accomplishe all thy deuice.
{20:5} We wyll reioyce in thy saluation, and triumph in the name of our Lorde: for God wyll perfourme all thy petitions.
{20:6} Nowe I knowe that God wyll saue his annoynted, he wyll heare him from his heauenly sanctuarie: there is saluation in the mightinesse of his right hande.
{20:7} Some put their trust in chariotes, and some in horses: but we wyll remember the name of God our Lorde.
{20:8} They shalbe made to bowe and fall: but we shall arise, and stande vpright.
{20:9} Saue thou O God: that the king may heare vs in the day when we call.
{21:1} To the chiefe musition, a psalme of Dauid. The kyng ought to reioyce in thy strength O God: and he ought to be exceedyng glad of thy saluation.
{21:2} Thou hast geuen him his heartes desire: and hast not denied him the request of his lippes. Selah.
{21:3} For thou hast preuented him with good blessinges: and hast set a crowne of pure golde vpon his head.
{21:4} He asked life of thee, and thou gauest him long dayes: euen for euer and euer.
{21:5} His honour is great through thy saluation: thou hast layde glorie and great worship vpon him.
{21:6} For thou hast placed him to be blessinges for euer: and hast made him glad with the ioy of thy countenaunce.
{21:7} Because the king trusteth in God, and in the mercie of the most highest: he shal not miscarie.
{21:8} Thine hande wyll finde out all thine enemies: thy right hande wyll finde out them that hate thee.
{21:9} Thou wilt make them like a burnyng furnace in tyme of thy furie: God wyll destroy them in his wrath, and fire shall consume them.
{21:10} Thou wilt roote their fruite out of the earth: and their seede from among the children of men.
{21:11} For they intended mischiefe agaynst thee, and imagined a craftie deuice: but they coulde not bring it to passe.
{21:12} Therfore thou wilt put them to flight: and direct thine arrowes agaynst their faces.
{21:13} Be thou exalted O God accordyng to thine owne might: so we wyll sing, and with psalmes we wyll prayse thy power.
{22:1} To the chiefe musition of the mornyng hinde, a psalme of Dauid. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so farre from my health, and from the wordes of my complaynt?
{22:2} O my God I crye all the day tyme, and in the night season, and I ceasse not: but thou hearest not.
{22:3} And yet thou most holy: sittest to receaue the prayers of Israel.
{22:4} Our fathers hoped in thee: they trusted in thee, & thou didst deliuer them.
{22:5} They called vpon thee, and they were helped: they did put their trust in thee, and they were not confounded.
{22:6} But as for me I am a worme and no man: a very scorne of men, and an outcast of the people.
{22:7} All they that see me, laugh me to scorne: they do make a mowe, and nod their head at me.
{22:8} Saying he referreth all to God, loking that God wyll deliuer him and rescue him: for he delighteth only in him.
{22:9} But thou art he that tokest me out of my mothers wombe: thou causedst me to trust in thee, suckyng my mothers breastes.
{22:10} I haue ben left vnto thee euer since I was borne: thou art my God euen from my mothers wombe.
{22:11} O go not far fro me, for trouble is harde at hande: and there is none to helpe me.
{22:12} Many oxen are come about me: fat bulles of Bashan close me in on euery syde.
{22:13} They gape vpon me with their mouthes: as it were a rampyng and a roryng lion.
{22:14} I am as it were into water resolued, and all my bones are out of ioynt: my heart also is like waxe melted in the middest of my bowels.
{22:15} My strength is dried vp like a potsheard, & my tongue cleaueth to my gummes: and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
{22:16} For dogges are come about me, the assemble of the wicked lay siege agaynst me: they haue pearced my handes and my feete, I may tell all my bones.
{22:17} (22:16) I may tell all my bones. (22:17) They stande staring & gasing vpon me:
{22:18} (22:17) they part my garmentes among them, and they cast lottes vpon my vesture.
{22:19} (22:18) But be not thou farre from me O God: thou art my strength, make haste to helpe me.
{22:20} (22:19) Delyuer my soule from the sworde: and my dearlyng from the dogges pawes.
{22:21} (22:20) Saue me from the Lions mouth: delyuer me from the hornes of the Unicornes.
{22:22} (22:21) I wyll declare thy name vnto my brethren: I wyll prayse thee in the middest of the congregation.
{22:23} (22:22) Saying prayse ye God ye that feare hym: glorifie hym all ye of the seede of Iacob, and stande in awe of hym all ye of the seede of Israel.
{22:24} (22:23) For he hath not dispised nor abhorred the affliction of the poore: he hath not hyd his face from hym, but he hearde hym when he cryed vnto hym.
{22:25} (22:24) My prayse shalbe of thee in the great congregation: I wyll perfourme my vowes in the syght of them that feare hym.
{22:26} (22:25) The poore shall eate, and be satisfied: they that seeke after God shall prayse hym, your heart shall lyue for euer.
{22:27} (22:26) All the endes of the worlde shall remember them selues and be turned vnto God: and all the kinredes of the nations shall worshyp before thy face.
{22:28} (22:27) For the kingdome is Gods: and he is the gouernour ouer the nations.
{22:29} (22:28) All such as be fat vpon the earth shall eate and worshyp: all they that go downe in to the dust shall knele before hym, although he preserued not his owne lyfe.
{22:30} (22:29) The posteritie shall serue hym: they shalbe counted vnto the Lorde for a generation.
{22:31} (22:30) They wyll come and declare his righteousnesse vnto a people that shalbe borne: for he hath done it.
{23:1} A psalme of Dauid. God is my sheephearde, therfore I can lacke nothyng:
{23:2} (23:1) he wyll cause me to repose my selfe in pasture full of grasse, and he wyll leade me vnto calme waters.
{23:3} (23:2) He wyll conuert my soule: he wyll bring me foorth into the pathes of righteousnesse for his name sake.
{23:4} (23:3) Yea though I walke through the valley of the shadowe of death, I wyll feare no euyll: for thou art with me, thy rodde and thy staffe be the thynges that do comfort me.
{23:5} (23:4) Thou wylt prepare a table before me in the presence of myne aduersaries: thou hast annoynted my head with oyle, and my cup shalbe brymme full.
{23:6} (23:5) Truely felicitie and mercie shal folowe me all the dayes of my lyfe: and I wyll dwell in the house of God for a long tyme.
{24:1} A psalme of Dauid. The earth is Gods and all that therin is: the worlde, & they that dwell therin.
{24:2} For he hath laide the foundation of it vpon the seas: and he hath set it sure vpon the fluddes.
{24:3} Who shal ascende into the hyll of God? or who shall ryse vp in his holy place?
{24:4} Euen he that hath cleane handes, and a pure heart: & that hath not taken his soule in vayne, nor sworne disceiptfully.
{24:5} He shall receaue a blessyng from God: and ryghteousnesse from the Lorde of his saluation.
{24:6} This is the generation of them that seke hym: euen of them that seke thy face in Iacob. Selah.
{24:7} Lyft vp your heades O ye gates, and be ye lyft vp ye euerlastyng doores and the kyng of glorie shall enter in.
{24:8} Who is this kyng of glorie? it is God both strong & mightie, it is God mightie in battayle.
{24:9} Lyft vp your heades (O ye gates) and be you lyft vp ye euerlastyng doores: and the kyng of glorie shall enter in.
{24:10} Who is this kyng of glorie? euen the God of hostes, he is the kyng of glorie. Selah.
{25:1} I lyft vp my soule vnto thee O God,
{25:2} (25:1) I put my trust in thee my Lorde: let me not be confounded, neither let myne enemies triumph ouer me.
{25:3} (25:2) Yea, let not all them that hope in thee be put to shame: let them be put to shame who without a cause do trayterously transgresse.
{25:4} (25:3) Make me to knowe thy wayes O God, and teache me thy pathes:
{25:5} (25:3) leade me foorth in thy trueth and teache me, for thou art the Lorde of my saluation, I haue wayted for thee al the day long.
{25:6} (25:4) Call to remembraunce O God thy tender mercies & thy louyng kindnesse: for they haue ben for euer.
{25:7} (25:5) Oh remember not thou the sinnes and offences of my youth: but accordyng to thy mercie euen of thy goodnesse O God remember me.
{25:8} (25:6) Gratious and ryghteous is God: therfore he wyll teache sinners in the way.
{25:9} (25:7) He wyll guide the meke in iudgement: and teache the humble his way.
{25:10} (25:8) All the pathes of God are mercie and trueth: vnto such as kepe his couenaunt and his testimonies.
{25:11} (25:9) Pardon thou therfore for thy name sake O God my wickednesse: for it is very great.
{25:12} (25:10) What man is he that feareth God? God wyll teache hym in the way that he shall choose.
{25:13} (25:11) His soule shall rest all nyght at ease: and his seede shall inherite the lande.
{25:14} (25:12) The secrete of God is among them that feare hym: and he wyll make knowen vnto them his couenaunt.
{25:15} (25:13) Myne eyes be alwayes turned vnto God: for he wyll take my feete out of the net.
{25:16} (25:14) Turne thy face vnto me, and haue mercie vpon me: for I am desolate and in miserie.
{25:17} (25:15) The sorowes of myne heart are encreased: O bryng thou me out of my distresse.
{25:18} (25:16) Loke thou vpon myne aduersitie and vpon my labour: and forgeue me all my sinne.
{25:19} (25:17) Consider myne enemies, for they do multiplie: and they beare a tirannous hate against me.
{25:20} (25:18) O kepe my soule and deliuer me, lest I shalbe confounded: for I haue put my trust in thee.
{25:21} (25:19) Let integritie and vprighteous dealing kepe me safe: for I haue wayted after thee.
{25:22} (25:20) O God redeeme Israel: out of all his aduersities.
{26:1} Of Dauid. Iudge thou me O God, for I haue walked in my perfection: my trust also hath ben in God therfore I shall not fall.
{26:2} Examine me O God and proue me: trye out my reynes and my heart.
{26:3} For thy louing kindnes is before mine eyes: and I wyll walke in thy trueth.
{26:4} I haue not sit in company with vayne persons: neither haue I entred once acquaintaunce with dissemblers.
{26:5} I haue hated the congregation of the malitious: and I wyll not sit amongst the vngodly.
{26:6} I haue wasshed my handes in innocencie: and so I haue gone about thine aulter O God.
{26:7} That in a publique confession I myght heare: and set foorth all thy wonderous workes.
{26:8} O God, I haue loued the habitation of thine house: and the place where thine honour dwelleth.
{26:9} O gather not my soule with sinners: nor my life with bloodie men.
{26:10} In whose handes is wickednes: and their right hande is full of gyftes.
{26:11} But as for me I wyll walke in my perfection: O redeeme me, and be mercyfull vnto me.
{26:12} My foote standeth vpon a playne grounde: therfore I wyll blesse God in the congregations.
{27:1} God is my lyght and saluation, whom then shall I feare? God is the strength of my life, of whom then shall I be afraide?
{27:2} When the malitious approched neare vnto me for to eate vp my fleshe: mine enemies and foes stumbled and fell.
{27:3} Though an hoast of men were layde in campe against me, yet shall not mine heart be afraide: and though there rose vp warre against me, yet I wyll put my trust in this.
{27:4} I haue desired one thyng of God, whiche once agayne I wyll earnestly require: euen that I may dwell in the house of God all the dayes of my life, to beholde the beautifulnes of God, and to seeke it in his temple.
{27:5} For in the time of aduersitie he shall hide me in his tabernacle: yea in the secrete place of his pauilion he shall hide me, and set me vp vpon a rocke of stone.
{27:6} And nowe he shall lift vp my head aboue mine enemies rounde about me: therfore I wyll offer in his tabernacle a sacrifice of great ioy, I wyll sing and prayse God with psalmes.
{27:7} Hearken vnto my voyce O god, when I crye vnto thee: haue mercy vpon me and heare me.
{27:8} My heart hath sayde vnto thee according to this thy commaundement seeke ye my face: thy face O God wyll I seeke.
{27:9} O hide not thou thy face from me, nor cast thy seruaunt away in a displeasure: thou hast ben my succour, leaue me not, neither forsake me O Lorde of my saluation.
{27:10} For my father and mother forsoke me: and God did take me vp.
{27:11} Teache me thy way O God: and leade me in a right path, because of mine enemies.
{27:12} Deliuer me not into mine aduersaries handes: for there are false witnesses rysen vp against me, and such as speake wrong.
{27:13} If I had not beleued veryly to see the goodnes of God in the lande of the liuing: their spite had kylled me.
{27:14} Attende thou therfore vpon God, be of a good courage, and he will comfort thine heart: I say attende thou vpon God.
{28:1} Vnto thee I crye O God my strength, make not as though thou were deafe at me: lest if thou holdest thy peace, I become like them that go downe into the graue.
{28:2} Heare the voyce of my humble petitions when I crye vnto thee: when I holde vp my handes towarde thy holy place where thy arke is.
{28:3} Take me not away with the vngodlye, and with the workers of iniquitie: whiche speake of peace to their neighbours, but mischiefe is in their heartes.
{28:4} Rewarde them accordyng to their deedes: and according to the wickednes of their owne inuentions. (28:5) Recompence them after the worke of their handes: pay them home that they haue deserued.
{28:5} (28:6) For they geue not their minde to vnderstande the doynges of God and the worke of his handes: therefore he wyll breake them downe, and not buylde them vp.
{28:6} (28:7) Blessed be God: for he hath hearde the voyce of mine humble petitions.
{28:7} (28:8) God is my strength and my shielde, my heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart skippeth for ioy, and in my song I wyll prayse hym.
{28:8} (28:9) God is their strength: and the strength that saueth his annoynted.
{28:9} (28:10) O saue thy people, and geue thy blessing vnto thine inheritaunce: feede them and exalt them for euermore.
{29:1} A tribute vnto God O ye sonnes of princes: attribute vnto God glory and strength.
{29:2} Geue to God glory due vnto his name: worship God with holy honour.
{29:3} The voyce of God is aboue waters: it is the Lorde of glory that thundreth, it is God that ruleth the sea.
{29:4} The voyce of God is with power: the voyce of God is with honour.
{29:5} The voyce of God breaketh the Cedar trees: yea God breaketh the Cedars of Libanus.
{29:6} And he maketh them to skip like a calfe: Libanus also and Sirion like a young vnicorne.
{29:7} The voyce of God casteth out flambes of fire:
{29:8} (29:7) the voyce of God maketh the wyldernesse to tremble, God maketh the wyldernesse of Cades to tremble.
{29:9} (29:8) The voyce of God maketh Hindes to cast their calfe, and maketh woods to be bare: therefore euery man setteth foorth his glory in his temple.
{29:10} (29:9) God sitteth in the flud: and God wil sit king for euer.
{29:11} (29:10) God wyll geue strength vnto his people: God wyll blesse his people in peace.
{30:1} A psalme whiche is a song of the dedication of the house of Dauid. I wyll exalt thee O God, for thou hast exalted me: and hast not made my foes to triumph ouer me.
{30:2} O God my Lord I cryed vnto thee: and thou hast healed me.
{30:3} Thou God hast raysed vp my soule from the graue: thou hast preserued my life from them that go downe into ye pit.
{30:4} Sing psalmes vnto god ye his saintes: and make your confession vnto the remembraunce of his holynes.
{30:5} For a litle short time passeth in his anger, a life is spente in his good wyll: at euening weeping shall begin the night, but ioy commeth in the morning.
{30:6} And in my prosperitie I saide, I shall neuer haue a fal:
{30:7} (30:6) thou God of thy goodnes hadst made my hyll so strong.
{30:8} (30:7) Neuerthelesse, when thou dydst turne thy face, I was troubled: then I cryed vnto thee O God, then made I my humble prayers to thee my Lorde.
{30:9} (30:8) Saying what profite is there in my blood when I go downe to the pit? shal the dust geue thankes vnto thee? or shall it declare thy trueth?
{30:10} (30:9) Heare me O God, and haue mercy vppon me: O God be thou my helper.
{30:11} (30:10) And foorthwith thou hast turned my mourning into dauncing: thou hast put of my sackcloth, and gyrded me with gladnes.
{30:12} (30:11) Therfore my glory shal sing psalmes vnto thee and not ceasse: O God my Lorde I wyll prayse thee for euer.
{31:1} To the chiefe musition, a psalme of Dauid. In thee O God I haue put my trust, let me neuer be confounded: deliuer me in thy righteousnes.
{31:2} Bowe downe thine eare to me, make hast to deliuer me: be vnto me a strong rocke and a house of defence, that thou mayest saue me.
{31:3} For thou art my strong rocke and fortresse: euen for thy name sake conduct me, and direct me.
{31:4} Take me out of the net that they haue layde priuily for me: for thou art my strength.
{31:5} Into thy hande I commende my spirite: for thou hast redeemed me O God the Lorde of trueth.
{31:6} I haue hated them that obserue superstitious vanities: and my trust hath ben in God.
{31:7} I wyll be glad and reioyce in thy louing kindnes: for that thou hast considered my trouble, and hast knowen my soule in aduersities.
{31:8} Thou hast not shut me vp into the hande of the enemie: but hast set my feete in a large roome.
{31:9} Haue mercy vpon me O God, for I am in distresse: mine eye, my soule, and my belly be consumed for very heauinesse.
{31:10} For my life is wasted with sorow, and mine eares with mourning: my strength fayleth me because of mine iniquitie, and my bones are putrified.
{31:11} I became a reprofe among al mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours: and they of mine acquaintaunce were afraide of me, and they that dyd see me without, conueyed them selues quickly fro me.
{31:12} I became cleane forgotten as a dead man out of minde: I became like a broken vessell.
{31:13} For I haue hearde the villanie of the multitude, and feare was on euery side me: whyle they conspired together against me, and toke their counsell to take away my life.
{31:14} But my hope hath ben in thee O God: I haue sayd thou art my Lorde.
{31:15} My time is in thy hande, deliuer me from the hande of mine enemies: and from them that persecute me.
{31:16} Cause thy countenaunce to shine vppon thy seruaunt: saue me for thy mercies sake.
{31:17} Let me not be confounded O God, for I haue called vpon thee: let the vngodlye be put to confusion, and be put to scilence in the graue.
{31:18} Let the lying lippes be put to scilence: which speake against ye righteous greeuous thinges with disdaine & contempt.
{31:19} Howe plentifull is thy goodnes which thou hast layde vp for them that feare thee? and whiche thou hast prepared for them that put their trust in thee before the sonnes of men.
{31:20} Thou hydest them priuily in thyne owne presence from the raginges of all men: thou kepest them secretly as in a tabernacle from the strife of tongues.
{31:21} Blessed be God: for he hath shewed me marueylous great kindnes in a strong citie.
{31:22} And when I fled with al haste, I said I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes: neuerthelesse, thou heardest the voyce of my prayer when I cryed vnto thee.
{31:23} Loue God all ye his saintes: for God preserueth them that are faythfull, and rewardeth most aboundauntly the proude doer.
{31:24} All ye that put your trust in God be ye of a good courage: and he wyll comfort your heart.
{32:1} A wyse instruction of Dauid. Blessed is he whose wickednes is forgeuen: and whose sinne is couered.
{32:2} Blessed is ye man vnto whom God imputeth no vnrighteousnes: & in whose spirit there is no guile.
{32:3} For whyle I helde my tongue: my bones consumed away through my dayly roaring.
{32:4} For thy hande is heauie vpon me day and night: and my moysture is like the drouth in sommer. Selah.
{32:5} Therfore I haue made knowen my faultes vnto thee, and my righteousnes haue I not hid: I sayd I will confesse my wickednes vnto God, and thou forgauest the vnrighteousnes of my sinne. Selah.
{32:6} For this shall euery one that is godly make his prayer vnto thee in the time when thou mayest be founde: so that in the great water fluddes they shal not come nye hym.
{32:7} Thou art my refuge, thou wylt preserue me from trouble: thou wylt compasse me about with songes of deliueraunce. Selah.
{32:8} I will geue thee wise instructions, and teach thee in the way wherin thou shalt go: & I wil guyde thee with mine eye.
{32:9} Be ye not lyke a horse or lyke a mule whiche haue no vnderstanding: whose mouthes must be holden with bit and brydle, lest they fall vpon thee.
{32:10} Great plagues remaine for the vngodly: but who so putteth his trust in God, mercy imbraceth him on euery side.
{32:11} Be glad in God, & reioyce O ye righteous: be ioyfull also all ye that be vpright of heart.
{33:1} Reioyce in God O ye righteous: for prayse becommeth well the iust.
{33:2} Confesse it to god with the harpe: sing psalmes vnto hym with the viall, and with the instrument of ten stringes.
{33:3} Sing vnto him a new song: do it cunningly, make a sweete noyse with your musicall instrumentes alowde.
{33:4} For the word of God is right: and euery worke of his done in fayth.
{33:5} He loueth righteousnes & iudgement: the earth is ful of the goodnes of God.
{33:6} By the worde of God are the heauens made: and all the hoastes of them by the breath of his mouth.
{33:7} He gathereth the waters of the sea together as it were vpon an heape: and layeth vp the deepe as treasures.
{33:8} Let all the earth feare God: let all they that dwell in the worlde stande in awe of him.
{33:9} For he spake and it was: he commauded, and it was brought to passe.
{33:10} God bringeth the counsell of the Heathen to naught: and maketh the deuises of the people to be of none effect.
{33:11} The counsayle of God shall endure for euer: and the thoughtes of his heart from generation to generation.
{33:12} Blessed is the nation that hath God to be their Lorde: that people hath he chosen to be an inheritaunce for him.
{33:13} God looketh downe from heauen, and beholdeth all the chyldren of men
{33:14} (33:13) from the place where he resteth: he eyeth diligently euery dweller on the earth.
{33:15} (33:14) He fashioneth their heartes together: he vnderstandeth al their workes.
{33:16} (33:15) A king is not saued by the multitude of an hoast: a man of great myght escapeth not by much strength.
{33:17} (33:16) A horse for to saue is vanitie: and he can deliuer none by his great strength.
{33:18} (33:17) Beholde, the eye of God is vpon them that feare hym: and vpon them that wayteth after his mercy.
{33:19} (33:18) To deliuer their soules from death: and to preserue their liues in dearth.
{33:20} (33:19) Our soule wayteth after God: he is our ayde and shielde.
{33:21} (33:20) For our heart shall reioyce in him: because we haue put our trust in his holy name.
{33:22} (33:21) Let thy louing kindnes O God be vppon vs: like as we haue put our trust in thee.
{34:1} Of Dauid when he chaunged his behauiour before Abimelech, whiche droue him away, and he departed. I wyll alway blesse God: his prayse shall euer be in my mouth.
{34:2} My soule shal glory in God: the humble shall heare therof and be glad.
{34:3} Magnifie God with me: and let vs exalt his name all together.
{34:4} Carefully I sought God, & he hearde me: yea he deliuered me out of all my feare.
{34:5} Let them turne their eyes on him, and make speede to come vnto hym: and their faces shall not be ashamed.
{34:6} Lo this same poore man hath cryed: and God hath hearde hym, and saued hym out of all his troubles.
{34:7} The angell of God campeth rounde about them that feare hym: and deliuereth them.
{34:8} O taste and see how gracious God is: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
{34:9} Feare God ye that be his saintes: for they that feare him lacke nothing.
{34:10} Young Lions do lacke and suffer hunger: but they whiche seeke God, shall want no maner of thing that is good.
{34:11} Come ye chyldren and hearken vnto me: I will teache you the feare of God.
{34:12} What man is he that listeth to liue: and woulde fayne see good dayes.
{34:13} Kepe thy tongue from euill: and thy lippes that they speake no guyle.
{34:14} Eschewe euill & do good: seeke peace and ensue it.
{34:15} The eyes of God are ouer the righteous: and his eares are open vnto their prayers.
{34:16} The countenaunce of God is against them that do euill: to roote out the remembraunce of them from of the earth.
{34:17} The righteous crye, and God heareth them: and deliuereth them out of all their troubles.
{34:18} God is nye vnto them that are of a contrite heart: and saueth such as be of an humble spirite.
{34:19} Great are the troubles of the righteous: but God deliuereth him out of all.
{34:20} He kepeth all his bones: so that no one of them is broken.
{34:21} Malice shal put the vngodly to death: and they that hate the righteous, shalbe brought to naught.
{34:22} God redeemeth the soules of his seruauntes: and al they that put their trust in him, shall not be brought to naught.
{35:1} Of Dauid. Pleade thou my cause O God, with them that striue with me: and fight thou agaynst them that fight against me.
{35:2} Lay hand vppon a shielde & buckler: and stande vp to helpe me.
{35:3} Bryng foorth the speare, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say vnto my soule, I am thy saluation.
{35:4} Let them be confounded and put to shame that seeke after my soule: let them be turned backe and brought to cofusion, that imagine mischiefe for me.
{35:5} Let them be as dust before the winde: and let the angell of God scatter them.
{35:6} Let their way be darke and slipperie: & let the angell of God persecute them.
{35:7} For without a cause they haue priuily layde for me a pit full of their nettes: without a cause they haue made a digyng vnto my soule.
{35:8} Let a sodayne destruction come vpon hym vnawares: and his net that he hath layde priuily catch hym selfe, let him fall into it with his owne destruction.
{35:9} And my soule shalbe ioyfull in God: it shall reioyce in his saluation.
{35:10} All my bones shall say, God who is lyke vnto thee? whiche deliuerest the poore from hym that is to strong for him: yea the poore and him that is in miserie, from him that spoyleth him.
{35:11} False witnesse did rise vp: they layde thinges to my charge that I know not.
{35:12} They rewarded me euill for good: to the great discomfort of my soule.
{35:13} Neuerthelesse, when they were sicke I did put on sackcloth: I afflicted my soule with fasting, and my prayer returned into myne owne bosome.
{35:14} I kept them company whersoeuer they went, as though they had ben my frende or brother: I went heauyly, as one that mourned for his mother.
{35:15} But in mine aduersitie they reioysed and gathered them together: yea, the very abiectes came together against me, yer I wyst they rented me a peeces and ceassed not.
{35:16} With hypocrites, scoffers, and parasites: they gnashed vpon me with their teeth.
{35:17} Lorde howe long wylt thou looke vpon this: O deliuer my soule from their raginges, and my dearling from Lions whelpes.
{35:18} So I wyll confesse it vnto thee in a great congregation: I will prayse thee among muche people.
{35:19} O let not my deceiptfull enemies triumph ouer me: let them not winke with an eye, that hate me without a cause.
{35:20} For they speake not peace: but they imagine deceiptfull wordes agaynst them that liue quietly in the lande.
{35:21} They gaped vpon me with their mouthes: and said this is well, this is wel, our eye hath seene.
{35:22} Thou hast seene this O God, holde not thy tongue then: go not farre from me O Lorde.
{35:23} Stirre thou and awake O my God and my Lorde: to iudge my cause and controuersie.
{35:24} Iudge me according to thy righteousnesse O God my Lorde: and let them not triumph ouer me.
{35:25} Let them not say in their heart, it is as we woulde haue it: neither let them say, we haue deuoured hym.
{35:26} Let them be put to confusion & shame all together that reioyce at my trouble: let them be clothed with rebuke and dishonour that exalt them selues against me.
{35:27} Let them triumph with gladnesse and reioyce that be delighted with my righteousnesse: let them say alwayes, blessed be God whiche hath pleasure in the prosperitie of his seruaunt.
{35:28} And my tongue shalbe talking of thy righteousnesse: and of thy prayse all the day long.
{36:1} To the chiefe musition, seruaunt to the God of Dauid. The wickednes of the vngodly speaketh in the middest of my heart: that there is no feare of the Lorde before his eyes.
{36:2} For he flattereth him selfe in his owne sight: so that his iniquitie is found worthy of hatred.
{36:3} The wordes of his mouth are vnrighteous and full of deceipt: he hath left of to behaue him selfe wisely & to do good.
{36:4} He imagineth mischiefe vpon his bed, & setteth him selfe in no good way: neither doth he abhorre any thing yt is euil.
{36:5} Thy mercy O God reacheth vnto heauen: and thy faythfulnes vnto the cloudes.
{36:6} Thy righteousnes is like the mountaynes of God: thy iudgementes are a great deapth, thou sauest both man and beast O God.
{36:7} How excellent is thy mercy O Lord: therefore the chyldren of men shall put their trust vnder the shadowe of thy winges.
{36:8} They shalbe satisfied with the plenteousnesse of thy house: and thou shalt geue them drinke out of the riuer of thy delicates.
{36:9} For with thee is the fountaine of lyfe: and in thy light shall we see light.
{36:10} O continue foorth thy louing kindnesse vnto them that knowe thee: and thy righteousnes vnto them that are of an vpright heart.
{36:11} O let not the foote of pryde reache vnto me: and let not the hande of the vngodly make me to moue out of my place
{36:12} There be the workers of iniquitie fallen: they are cast downe, and shall not be able to rise vp.
{37:1} Of Dauid. Fret not thy selfe because of the vngodly: neither be thou enuious against the euyll doers.
{37:2} For they shall soone be cut downe like the grasse: and be withered euen as the greene hearbe.
{37:3} Put thou thy trust in God, and be doing good: dwell in the land, and feede in trueth.
{37:4} Delight thou also in God: and he shall geue thee thy heartes desire.
{37:5} Commit thy way vnto God: and put thy trust in hym, and he shall bryng it to passe.
{37:6} He shall make thy righteousnesse appeare as cleare as the light: and thy iust dealing as the noone tyde.
{37:7} Holde thee still in God, and wayte paciently vpon him: fret not thy selfe at him whose way doth prosper, at the man that doth abhominations.
{37:8} Leaue of from wrath, and let go displeasure: fret not thy selfe, lest thou be moued to do euill.
{37:9} For the malitious doers shalbe rooted out: and they that paciently wayte after God, they shall inherite the lande.
{37:10} Looke at them yet a litle whyle, and the vngodly shalbe cleane gone: thou shalt looke after his place, and he shall not be there
{37:11} But the meeke spirited shall possesse the earth: and shalbe delighted in the aboundaunce of peace.
{37:12} The vngodly busieth his head all against the iust: and gnasheth vpon him with his teeth.
{37:13} The Lorde shall laugh him to scorne: for he seeth that his day is comming.
{37:14} The vngodly haue drawen out the sworde, and haue bended their bowe: to cast downe the poore and needie, and to slay such as be of right conuersation.
{37:15} But their sworde shal go thorow their owne heart: & their bow shalbe broken.
{37:16} A small thing that the righteous hath: is better then great riches of ye vngodly.
{37:17} For the armes of the vngodly shalbe broken: and God vpholdeth the righteous.
{37:18} God knoweth the dayes of them that be perfect: and their inheritaunce shall endure for euer.
{37:19} They shall not be confounded in the perilous tyme: and in the dayes of dearth they shall haue inough.
{37:20} As for the vngodly they shall perishe, and the enemies of God shall consume as the fat of lambes: yea, euen with the smoke they shall vanishe away.
{37:21} The vngodly boroweth and payeth not agayne: but the righteous geueth mercifully and liberally.
{37:22} Suche as be blessed of God shall possesse the lande: and they that be cursed of hym, shalbe rooted out.
{37:23} The pathes of man is directed by God: and his way pleaseth.
{37:24} Though he fall, he shall not be vndone: for God vpholdeth him with his hande.
{37:25} I haue ben a young chylde, and nowe I am olde: and yet sawe I neuer the righteous forsaken, nor his seede begyng bread.
{37:26} The righteous is euer mercifull and lendeth: and his seede is blessed.
{37:27} Flee from euill & do good: and dwell for euer.
{37:28} For God loueth iudgement, he forsaketh not his saintes: they are preserued for euermore, but the seede of the vngodlye shalbe rooted vp.
{37:29} The righteous shal inherite the land: and dwell therin for euer.
{37:30} The mouth of the righteous is exercised in wysdome: and his tongue wyll be talking of iudgement.
{37:31} The lawe of his God is in his heart: therfore his feete shall not slide.
{37:32} The vngodly spyeth the righteous: and seeketh occasion to slay hym.
{37:33} God wyll not leaue him in his hande: nor suffer hym to be condemned when he is iudged.
{37:34} Wayte thou on God & kepe his way, and he wyll promote thee, that thou mayest possesse the lande: when the vngodly shalbe cut of, thou shalt see it.
{37:35} I my selfe haue seene the vngodly in great power: and florishing lyke a greene bay tree.
{37:36} And he vanished away, so that he could be no more seene: I sought hym, but he coulde no where be founde.
{37:37} Marke hym that is perfect, and beholde him that is iust: for the ende of suche a man is peace.
{37:38} As for wicked transgressours, they shalbe destroyed all together: and the ende of the vngodly shalbe rooted vp at the last.
{37:39} But saluation of the righteous commeth of God: whiche is also their strength in time of trouble.
{37:40} And God wyll ayde them and deliuer them, he wyl deliuer them from the vngodly: and he wyll saue them, because they put their trust in him.
{38:1} A psalme of Dauid to reduce in remembraunce. Rebuke me not O God in thyne anger: neither chasten me in thy heauie displeasure.
{38:2} For thyne arrowes sticke fast in me: and thy hande presseth me sore.
{38:3} There is no helath in my flesh through thy displeasure: neither is there any rest in my bones by reason of my sinne.
{38:4} For my manyfolde wickednes is gone ouer my head: and like a sore burthen is to heauie for me to beare.
{38:5} My woundes stinke and are corrupt: through my foolishnes.
{38:6} I am become crooked, and am exceedingly pulled downe: I go a mourning all the day long.
{38:7} For my loynes are filled with heate: and there is no whole part in my body.
{38:8} I am feeble and sore smitten: I haue rored for the very disquietnesse of my heart.
{38:9} Lorde thou knowest all my desire: and my gronyng is not hyd from thee.
{38:10} My heart panteth, my strength hath fayled me: and the lyght of myne eyes is gone from me.
{38:11} My louers and my neygbours dyd stande on the other syde lokyng vpon my plague: and my kinsmen stoode a farre of.
{38:12} They also that sought after my lyfe layde snares for me: and they that went about to do me euyll, talked of wickednesse, and imagined deceipt all the day long.
{38:13} As for me, as one deafe I woulde not heare: and I was as one that is dumbe who coulde not open his mouth.
{38:14} I became euen as a man that heareth not: and who hath no replies in his mouth.
{38:15} For on thee O God I haue wayted: thou shalt aunswere for me O Lorde my God.
{38:16} For I sayde heare me lest that they shoulde triumph on me: who auaunce them selues greatly agaynst me when my foote doth slyp.
{38:17} Because I am disposed to a haltyng: and my sorowe is euer in my syght.
{38:18} Because I confesse my wickednesse: and am sory for my sinne.
{38:19} But myne enemies lyuyng without payne are mightie: & they that hate me wrongfully are increased in number.
{38:20} They also that rewarde euyl for good are agaynst me: because I folowe the thyng that is good.
{38:21} Forsake me not O God: O my Lorde be not thou farre fro me.
{38:22} Haste thee to helpe me: O Lorde my saluation.
{39:1} To the chiefe musition Ieduthun, a psalme of Dauid. I sayde to my selfe I wyll take heede to my wayes, that I offende not in my tongue: I wyll kepe my mouth as it were with a brydell, whylest the vngodly is in my syght.
{39:2} I became dumbe through scilence, I helde my peace from speakyng of good wordes: but the more was my sorowe increased.
{39:3} My heart was hotte within me, and whyle I was thus musyng the fire kyndled: and at the last I spake with my tongue.
{39:4} O God make me to knowe mine ende, and the number of my dayes: that I may be certified howe long I haue to lyue.
{39:5} Behold thou hast made my dayes as it were an hand breadth long, & mine age is euen as nothing before thee: truely euery man is al together vanitie. Selah.
{39:6} Truely man walketh in a vayne shadowe, truely he and all his do disquiet them selues in vayne: he heapeth vp riches, & can not tel who shal vse them.
{39:7} And nowe Lord what wayte I after? truely my hope is euen in thee.
{39:8} Delyuer me from all my offences: and make me not a rebuke vnto the foolishe.
{39:9} I became dumbe, and opened not my mouth: for it was thy doyng.
{39:10} Take thy plague away from me: I am euen consumed by the meanes of thy heauy hande.
{39:11} Thou doest chasten man, rebukyng him for sinne: thou as a moth doest consume his excellencie, for in very deede euery man is but vanitie. Selah.
{39:12} Heare my prayer O God, and geue eares to my crying, holde not thy peace at my teares: for I am a strauger with thee, and a soiourner as all my fathers were.
{39:13} Oh spare me a litle, that I may recouer my strength: before I go hence, and be no more seene.
{40:1} To the chiefe musition, a psalme of Dauid. I wayted patiently vpon God, and he enclined vnto me his eare: and heard my crying.
{40:2} He brought me also out of an horrible pyt, out of the dirtie mire: and set my feete vpon a rocke, and directed my goynges.
{40:3} And he hath put a newe song in my mouth: euen a thankesgeuyng vnto our Lorde.
{40:4} Many shall see it, and feare: and shall put their trust in God.
{40:5} Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in God: and turned not vnto the proude, and to such as decline to lyes.
{40:6} O God my Lord, great are thy wonderous workes which thou hast done: & none can count in order thy benefites towarde vs, yf I woulde declare them and speake of them, they shoulde be mo then I am able to expresse.
{40:7} Thou wouldest haue no sacrifice or offeryng, but thou hast opened myne eares: thou hast not required burnt offerynges and sacrifice for sinne.
{40:8} Then sayde I, lo I am come: in the booke of thy lawe it is written of me that I shoulde fulfyll thy wyll O my God, I am content to do it, yea thy lawe is within the middest of my brest.
{40:9} I haue declared thy righteousnes in a great congregatio: lo I wil not refraine my lippes O God thou knowest it.
{40:10} I haue not hyd thy ryghteousnesse within my heart: my talkyng hath ben of thy trueth and of thy saluation. (40:11) I haue not concealed thy louyng mercie and trueth: from the great congregation.
{40:11} (40:12) Withdrawe not thou thy mercie from me O God: let thy louyng kyndnesse and thy trueth alway preserue me.
{40:12} (40:13) For innumerable troubles are come about me, my sinnes haue taken such holde vpon me that I am not able to loke vp: yea they are mo in number then the heeres of my head, & my heart hath fayled me.
{40:13} (40:14) O God let it be thy pleasure to deliuer me: make haste O God to helpe me.
{40:14} (40:15) Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seke after my soule to destroy it: let them be dryuen backwarde & be put to rebuke that wyshe me euyll.
{40:15} (40:16) Let them be desolate in recompence of their shame: that say vnto me, fye vpon thee, fye vpon thee.
{40:16} (40:17) Let all those that seeke thee be glad and ioyfull in thee: and let such as loue thy saluation, say alway God be magnified.
{40:17} (40:18) As for me I am afflicted and needye, but God careth for me: thou art my ayde and delyuerer, O my God make no long tarying.
{41:1} To the chiefe musition, a psalme of Dauid. Blessed is he that considereth ye poore: God wyll delyuer hym in the tyme of trouble.
{41:2} God wyll preserue hym & kepe him aliue: he shalbe blessed vpon the earth, and thou O God wylt not deliuer him into the wyll of his enemies.
{41:3} God wyll comfort hym when he lyeth sicke vpon his bed: thou O God wylt turne vpside downe all his bed in his sicknesse.
{41:4} I sayde, O God be mercifull vnto me: heale my soule, for I haue sinned agaynst thee.
{41:5} Myne enemies speake euyl of me: when shall he dye, and his name perishe?
{41:6} But yf any of them came to visite me, he spake vanitie: his heart conceaued vngodlynesse within hym selfe, & when he came foorth a doores he vttered it.
{41:7} All they that hated me whispered together: they imagined euyl agaynst me.
{41:8} They sayde some great mischiefe is lyghted vpon hym: and he that lyeth sicke on his bed, shall ryse vp no more.
{41:9} Yea besides this, euen myne owne friende whom I trusted: which dyd also eate of my bread, hath kicked very much agaynst me.
{41:10} But be thou mercifull vnto me O God: rayse me vp agayne, and I shall rewarde them.
{41:11} By this I knowe thou fauouredst me: in that myne enemie doth not triumph agaynst me.
{41:12} And when I am in my best case, thou vpholdest me: and thou wylt set me before thy face for euer.
{41:13} Blessed be God the Lorde of Israel: worlde without ende, Amen, Amen.
{42:1} To the chiefe musition a wise instruction of the sonnes of Corach. Lyke as the Hart brayeth for water brookes: so panteth my soule after thee O God.
{42:2} My soule is a thirst for the Lorde, yea euen for the lyuyng Lorde: when shall I come to appeare before the face of the Lorde?
{42:3} My teares haue ben my meate day and nyght: whyle they dayly say vnto me where is nowe thy God.
{42:4} And I powred out of me my very heart, remembryng this howe that before tyme I haue passed with a great number, bringyng the vnto the house of the Lord: with a voyce of ioy & prayse, & with a company that kept holy day.
{42:5} Why art thou so discouraged O my soule, & why art thou so vnquiet within me? attende thou vpon the Lorde, for I will yet acknowledge him only to be a present saluation.
{42:6} My Lorde, my soule is discouraged within me: because I remember thee from the lande of Iordane, and from the litle hyll Hermonim.
{42:7} One deepe calleth another at the noyse of thy water pypes: all thy waues and stormes are gone ouer me.
{42:8} God wyll graunt his louing kindnesse on the day tyme: and in the nyght season I wyll syng of hym, and make my prayer vnto the Lorde of my lyfe.
{42:9} I wyll say vnto the Lorde of my strength: why hast thou forgotten me, why go I thus heauyly through the oppression of myne enemie?
{42:10} It was as a sworde in my bones, when myne enemies dyd cast me in the teeth: in saying dayly vnto me, where is nowe thy Lorde?
{42:11} Why art thou so discouraged O my soule, & why art thou so vnquiet within me? attende thou vpon the Lorde, for I wil yet acknowledge him to be only my present saluation, and my Lorde.
{43:1} Iudge me O Lorde, and debate my cause with an vnnaturall people: oh delyuer me from the deceiptfull and wicked man.
{43:2} For thou art the Lord of my strength: why hast thou reiect me, and why go I thus heauyly through the oppression of myne enemie.
{43:3} Sende foorth thy light and thy trueth: that they may leade me and direct me vnto thy holy hyll, & to thy tabernacles.
{43:4} And I wyll go vnto the aulter of the Lorde, euen vnto the Lorde of my ioy & gladnesse: and vpon the harpe I will acknowledge thee O Lorde my Lord.
{43:5} Why art thou so discouraged O my soule, & why art thou so vnquiet within me? attende thou vpon the Lorde, for I wyll yet acknowledge hym to be only my present saluation, & my Lorde.
{44:1} To the chiefe musition, a wise instruction of the sonnes of Corach. We haue hearde with our eares O Lorde: our fathers haue tolde vs what workes thou hast done in their daies in the olde tyme.
{44:2} Howe thou hast driuen out the heathen with thy hande and planted them in: howe thou hast destroyed the nations & placed them.
{44:3} For they gat not the lande in possession through their owne sworde: neither was it their owne arme that saued them. (44:4) But thy ryght hande, and thine arme, & the lyght of thy countenaunce: because thou hadst a fauour vnto them.
{44:4} (44:5) Thou art my kyng O Lorde: commaunde that Iacob be saued.
{44:5} (44:6) Through thee we wyll ouerthrowe our enemies: and in thy name we wyll treade them vnder that ryse vp agaynst vs.
{44:6} (44:7) For I wyll not trust in my bowe: and it is not my sworde that can saue me.
{44:7} (44:8) But it is thou that sauest vs from our enemies: and thou puttest them to confusion that hate vs.
{44:8} (44:9) We make our boast of God all the day long: and we wyll confesse thy name for euer. Selah.
{44:9} (44:10) But nowe thou art farre of, and thou puttest vs to confusion: neither goest thou foorth with our armies.
{44:10} (44:11) Thou makest vs to turne away backwarde from the enemie: so that they which hate vs, do make vs a spoyle vnto them.
{44:11} (44:12) Thou hast delyuered vs as sheepe to be eaten: and thou hast scattered vs among the heathen.
{44:12} (44:13) Thou hast solde thy people for naught: and thou hast taken no money for them.
{44:13} (44:14) Thou hast made vs a rebuke to our neighbours: to be laughed to scorne and had in derision of them that are rounde about vs.
{44:14} (44:15) Thou hast made vs to be a fable among the heathen: and to be such that the people shake their head at vs.
{44:15} (44:16) My confusion is dayly before me, and the shame of my face couereth me:
{44:16} for to heare the voyce of the slaunderer & blasphemer, and for to see the enemie and the auenger.
{44:17} And though all this be come vpon vs: yet we do not forget thee, nor shewe our selues to be false in thy couenaunt.
{44:18} Our heart is not turned backe, neither our steppes be declined out of thy pathes:
{44:19} (44:18) no not when thou hast smitten vs in the place of dragons, and couered vs with the shadowe of death.
{44:20} (44:19) If we had forgotten the name of our Lorde, and holden vp our handes to any straunge god:
{44:21} (44:19) woulde not God searche it out? for he knoweth the very secretes of the heart.
{44:22} (44:20) For thy sake also are we kylled all the day long: and are counted as sheepe appoynted to be slayne.
{44:23} (44:21) Stirre vp O Lorde, why slepest thou? awake & be not absent from vs for euer:
{44:24} (44:21) wherfore hydest thou thy face, and forgettest our miserie and tribulation?
{44:25} (44:22) For our soule is brought lowe vnto the dust: our belly cleaueth vnto the grounde.
{44:26} (44:23) Aryse vp thou our ayde, and redeeme vs: for thy louyng kindnesse sake.
{45:1} To the chiefe musition (on the instrument) Sosannim (to be song of the) children of Corach. A song of loue, geuyng wise instructions. My heart is endityng of a good matter: I wyll dedicate my workes vnto the king, my tongue is as the penne of a redy writer.
{45:2} Thou art fayrer then the children of men, full of grace are thy lippes: because the Lorde hath blessed thee for euer.
{45:3} Girde thee with thy sworde vpon thy thygh O thou most mightie: that is with thy glorie and thy maiestie.
{45:4} Prosper thou with thy maiestie, ryde on the worde of trueth and of affliction for ryghteousnesse sake: and thy ryght hande shall teache thee terrible thynges.
{45:5} Thyne arrowes are sharpe: a people the kynges enemies shall submit in heart them selues vnto thee.
{45:6} Thy throne O Lorde endureth for euer and euer: the scepter of ryghteousnesse is the scepter of thy kyngdome.
{45:7} Thou hast loued iustice and hated vngodlynesse: wherfore the Lorde euen thy Lorde hath annoynted thee with the oyle of gladnesse more then thy felowes.
{45:8} All thy garmentes smell of Myrre, Aloes, and Cassia, out of the iuorie palaces: wherby they haue made thee glad.
{45:9} Kynges daughters are amongst thy honourable women: vpon thy ryght hande standeth the queene in a vesture of golde of Ophir.
{45:10} Hearken O daughter and consider, encline thine eare: forget also thine owne people and thy fathers house.
{45:11} So shall the kyng haue pleasure in thy beautie: for he is thy Lorde, and worship thou hym.
{45:12} And the daughter of Tyre shall come with a present: the riche among the people shall make their earnest prayer before thee.
{45:13} The kynges daughter is all glorious within: her clothyng is of wrought golde.
{45:14} She shalbe brought vnto the kyng in rayment of needle worke: the virgins that folowe her and her company shalbe brought vnto thee.
{45:15} With ioy and gladnesse shall they be brought: and shal enter into the kinges palace.
{45:16} In steade of thy fathers, thou shalt haue children: whom thou mayst make princes in all landes.
{45:17} I wyll remember thy name from one generation vnto another: therfore shall the people prayse thee worlde without ende.
{46:1} To the chiefe musition, a song (to be song) of the children of Corach vpon Alamoth. The Lorde is our refuge & strength: a helpe very easyly founde in troubles.
{46:2} Therfore we wyll not feare though the earth be transposed: and though the hilles rushe into the middest of the sea.
{46:3} Though the waters thereof rage and swell: and though the mountaynes shake at the surges of the same. Selah.
{46:4} Yet the fludde by his ryuers shall make glad the citie of God: the holy place of the tabernacles of the most hyghest.
{46:5} God is in the myddest of her, therfore she can not be remoued: the Lorde wyll helpe her, and that ryght early.
{46:6} The heathen make much a do, and the kyngdomes are moued: but God shewed his voyce, and the earth melted away.
{46:7} The God of hoastes is with vs: the Lorde of Iacob is our refuge. Selah.
{46:8} O come hither and beholde the workes of God: what distructions he hath brought vpon the earth.
{46:9} He maketh warres to ceasse in all the worlde: he breaketh the bowe, & knappeth the speare in sunder, and burneth the charettes in the fire.
{46:10} Be styll then, and knowe that I am the Lorde: I wyll be exalted among the heathen, I wyll be exalted in the earth.
{46:11} The God of hoastes is with vs: the Lorde of Iacob is our refuge. Selah.
{47:1} To the chiefe musition, a psalme (to be song) of the children of Corach. Clap your handes all ye people: make a noise vnto the Lorde with a ioyfull voyce.
{47:2} For God is hygh and terrible: he is the great king vpon all the earth.
{47:3} He wyll subdue the people vnder vs: and the nations vnder our feete.
{47:4} He hath chosen for vs our inheritaunce: the glorie of Iacob who he loued. Selah.
{47:5} The Lorde ascendeth in a triumph: and God with the sounde of a trumpet.
{47:6} Syng psalmes to the Lorde, syng psalmes: syng psalmes to our kyng, sing psalmes.
{47:7} For the Lorde is kyng of all the earth: syng psalmes all you that haue skyll.
{47:8} God raigneth ouer the heathen: God sitteth vpon his holy throne.
{47:9} The princes of the people are assembled together for to be the people of the God of Abraham: for the shieldes of the earth be Gods, who is hyghly exalted.
{48:1} A song, the psalme of the children of Corach. Great is God, and hyghly to be praysed: in the citie of our Lorde, his holy hyll.
{48:2} The hyll of Sion is fayre in situation, and the ioy of the whole earth: vpon the north syde lyeth the citie of the great king.
{48:3} God is well knowen in her palaces: as a most sure refuge.
{48:4} For lo kinges did assemble, and passe by together:
{48:5} (48:4) they them selues sawe it, lykewyse they marueyled, they were astonyed with feare, and sodenly in haste they were gone away.
{48:6} (48:5) A feare came there vpon them and sorowe: as vpon a woman in her childe trauayle.
{48:7} (48:6) Thou didst breake the shippes of the sea: through the east wynde.
{48:8} (48:7) Lyke as we haue hearde, so haue we seene in the citie of God of hoastes: in the citie of our Lorde, God vpholdeth the same for euer. Selah.
{48:9} (48:8) O Lorde we haue wayted: for thy louyng kindnesse in the myddest of thy temple.
{48:10} (48:9) O Lorde, accordyng to thy name, so is thy prayse vnto the worldes ende: thy ryght hande is full of iustice.
{48:11} (48:10) Mount Sion shall reioyce, and the daughters of Iuda shalbe glad: because of thy iudgementes.
{48:12} (48:11) Compasse about Sion, and go rounde about her: and tell the towres therof.
{48:13} (48:12) Marke well her bulwarkes, beholde her hygh palaces: that ye may tell it to your posteritie.
{48:14} (48:13) For this God is our God for euer and euer: he wyll be our guide vnto death.
{49:1} To the chiefe musition, a psalme of the children of Corach. Heare this all ye people: geue eare all ye that dwell in the worlde.
{49:2} As well lowe as high: riche and poore, one with another.
{49:3} My mouth shall vtter wisdome: the cogitations of myne heart wyll bryng foorth knowledge.
{49:4} I wyll encline myne eare to a parable: I wyll open my darke sentence vpon a harpe.
{49:5} Wherfore shoulde I feare in euyll dayes? the wickednesse of my heeles then would compasse me round about.
{49:6} There be some that put their trust in their goodes: and boast them selues in the multitude of their riches.
{49:7} But no man at all can redeeme his brother: nor geue a raunsome vnto God for hym.
{49:8} For the redemption of their soule is very costly, and must be let alone for euer:
{49:9} (49:8) yea though he lyue long and see not the graue.
{49:10} (49:9) For he seeth that wyse men dye: and that the foole and ignoraunt perishe together, and leaue their riches for other.
{49:11} (49:10) And yet they thynke that their houses shall continue for euer, and that their dwellyng places shall endure from one generation to another: therfore they call landes after their owne names.
{49:12} (49:11) Neuerthelesse, man can not abyde in such honour: he is but lyke vnto bruite beastes that perishe.
{49:13} (49:12) This their way is their foolishnesse: yet their posteritie prayse their saying. Selah.
{49:14} (49:13) They shalbe put into a graue dead as a sheepe, death shall feede on them: but the ryghteous shall haue dominion of them in the mornyng, their beautie shall consume away, hell shall receaue them from their house.
{49:15} (49:14) But God wyll delyuer my soule from the place of hell: for he wyll receaue me. Selah.
{49:16} (49:15) Be not thou afrayde though one be made riche: or yf the glorie of his house be encreased.
{49:17} (49:16) For he shall cary nothyng away with hym when he dyeth: neither shall his pompe folowe after hym.
{49:18} (49:17) For whyle he lyued he counted him selfe an happy man: and so long as thou doest well vnto thy selfe, men wyll speake good of thee.
{49:19} (49:18) But he shal folowe the generations of his fathers: and shall neuer see lyght.
{49:20} (49:19) A man is in an honourable state, but he wyll not vnderstande it: he is lyke herein vnto bruite beastes that perishe.
{50:1} A psalme of Asaph. The most mightie Lorde God hath spoken: and called the earth from the rysyng vp of the sunne, vnto the goyng downe therof.
{50:2} Out of Sion: hath the Lorde appeared in perfect beautie.
{50:3} Our Lorde commeth, and he wyll not kepe scilence: there goeth before hym a consumyng fire, and a mightie tempest is sturred rounde about hym.
{50:4} He calleth from aboue the heauen and the earth: that he may iudge his people.
{50:5} Gather my saintes together vnto me: those that haue made a couenaunt with me with sacrifice.
{50:6} And the heauens shall declare his ryghteousnesse: for God is iudge hym selfe. Selah.
{50:7} Heare O my people, and I wil speake: I my selfe wyll testifie vnto thee O Israel, I am the Lorde, euen thy Lorde.
{50:8} I wyll not reproue thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt offerynges: for that they be not alway before me.
{50:9} I wyll take no bullocke out of thy house: nor goates out of thy foldes.
{50:10} For all the beastes of the forest are myne: and so are the cattel vpon a thousande hylles.
{50:11} I knowe all the foules vpon the mountaynes: and the wylde beastes of the fielde are at my commaundement.
{50:12} If I be hungry, I wyll not tell thee: for the whole worlde is myne, and all that is therin.
{50:13} Thinkest thou that I will eate bulles fleshe: and drynke the blood of goates?
{50:14} Offer vnto God prayse: and pay thy vowes vnto the most hyghest.
{50:15} And call vpon me in the tyme of trouble: I wyll heare thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.
{50:16} But the Lorde sayd vnto the vngodly: why doest thou preache my lawes, and takest my couenaunt in thy mouth?
{50:17} Seyng that thou hatest discipline: and hast cast my wordes behynde thee.
{50:18} When thou sawest a thiefe, thou dydst consent vnto hym: and thou hast ben partaker with the adulterers.
{50:19} Thou hast let thy mouth speake wickednesse: and with thy tongue thou hast set foorth deceipt.
{50:20} Thou sattest and spakedst agaynst thy brother: yea and hast slaundered thine owne mothers sonne.
{50:21} These thynges hast thou done and I helde my tongue, thou thoughtest that I am euen such a one as thou thy selfe art: but I wyll reproue thee, and I wyll set foorth in order before thine eyes all that thou hast done.
{50:22} Consider this I pray you, ye that forget the Lorde: lest I plucke you away, and there be none to delyuer you.
{50:23} Who so offereth vnto me thankes and prayse, he honoureth me: and to hym that ordereth his conuersation ryght, I wyll shewe the saluation of God.
{51:1} To the chiefe musition, a psalme of Dauid when the prophete Nathan came vnto hym after he was gone in to Bethsabe. Haue mercie on me O Lorde accordyng to thy louyng kindnesse: accordyng vnto the multitudes of thy mercies wype out my wickednesse.
{51:2} Washe me throughly from myne iniquitie: and clense me from my sinne.
{51:3} For I do acknowledge my wickednesse: and my sinne is euer before me.
{51:4} Agaynst thee, only agaynst thee I haue sinned and done this euyll in thy sight: that thou mightest be iustified in thy saying, and founde pure when thou art iudged.
{51:5} Beholde, I was ingendred in iniquitie: and in sinne my mother conceaued me.
{51:6} Neuerthelesse, lo thou requirest trueth in the inwarde partes of me: & therfore thou wylt make me learne wisdome in the secrete part of myne heart.
{51:7} Purge thou me with hyssop and I shalbe cleane: washe thou me, and I shalbe whyter then snowe.
{51:8} Make thou me to heare some ioy and gladnesse: let the bones reioyce which thou hast broken.
{51:9} Turne thy face from my sinnes: and wype out all my misdeedes.
{51:10} Make thou vnto me a cleane heart O Lorde: and renue thou a ryght spirite within me.
{51:11} Cast me not away from thy presence: and take not thy holy spirite from me.
{51:12} Geue me agayne the comfort of thy saluation: and confirme me with a free wyllyng spirite.
{51:13} Then wyll I teache thy wayes vnto the wicked: and sinners shalbe conuerted vnto thee.
{51:14} Deliuer me from blood O Lorde, the Lorde of my saluation: and my tongue shall sing with a ioyfull noyse of thy iustice.
{51:15} O Lorde open thou my lippes: and my mouth shall set foorth thy prayse.
{51:16} For thou desirest no sacrifice, els I would geue it thee: thou delightest not in a burnt offering.
{51:17} Sacrifices for God is a mortified spirite: O Lorde thou wylt not despise a mortified and an humble heart.
{51:18} Be thou beneficiall vnto Sion, according to thy gracious good wyll: buylde thou the walles of Hierusalem.
{51:19} Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousnes, with burnt offeringes and oblations: then wyll they offer young bullockes vpon thyne aulter.
{52:1} To the chiefe musition, a wyse instruction of Dauid, when Doeg the Edomite came to Saul and tolde him, saying: Dauid is come to the house of Achimelek. Why boastest thy self thou tiraunt of mischiefe? the goodnes of God dayly endureth.
{52:2} Thy tongue imagineth wickednes: and deceaueth like a sharpe raser.
{52:3} Thou hast loued vngratiousnes more then goodnes: and to talke of falshood more then of righteousnes. Selah.
{52:4} Thou hast loued to speake all wordes that may do hurt: O thou deceiptfull tongue.
{52:5} Therfore the Lord wyll destroy thee for euer: he wyll take thee and plucke thee out of thy dwelling, and roote thee out of the lande of the liuing. Selah.
{52:6} The righteous also shall see this: and they wyll be afraide and laugh hym to scorne.
{52:7} Saying lo this is the man that put not the Lorde to be his strength: but trusted vnto the multitude of his riches, and strengthed him selfe in his wickednesse.
{52:8} As for me I am lyke a greene oliue tree in the house of the Lorde: my trust is in the tender mercy of the Lorde for euer and euer.
{52:9} I will alway confesse it vnto thee, for that thou hast done it: and I wyll hope in thy name, for it is good in the sight of thy saintes.
{53:1} To the chiefe musition vpon Mahalah, a wise instruction of Dauid. The foole hath sayde in his heart there is no God: they haue corrupted them selues, & haue made their wickednes abhominable, he is not that doeth good.
{53:2} The Lorde looked downe from heauen vpon the chyldren of men: to see if there were any that did vnderstand and seeke after the Lorde.
{53:3} But they dyd all go out of the way, they dyd altogether become abhomible: there was also none that would do good, no not one.
{53:4} Wyll not the workers of iniquitie vnderstande, eating vp my people as if they eated bread: that they do not call vpon God?
{53:5} They shalbe greatly there afraide where no cause of feare is: for the Lord wyll breake the bones of hym that besiegeth thee, thou wylt put them to shame, because the Lorde hath despised them.
{53:6} Who is he that wyll geue saluation vnto Israel out of Sion? when the Lord wyll reduce his people out of captiuitie, Iacob wyll reioyce, and Israel wyll be glad.
{54:1} To the chiefe musition vpon Neginoth, a wyse instruction of Dauid, when the Ziphims came and sayd vnto Saul, hath not Dauid hyd him selfe amongst vs? Saue me O Lorde for thy name sake: iudge me accordyng to thy mightie power.
{54:2} Heare my prayer O Lord: and hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.
{54:3} For straungers are rysen vp against me: and tirauntes whiche haue not the Lorde before their eyes, seeke after my soule. Selah.
{54:4} Behold, God is an ayde vnto me: the Lorde is with them that vpholde my soule.
{54:5} He wyll rewarde euyll vnto mine enemies: destroy thou them according to thy trueth.
{54:6} I wyll sacrifice vnto thee with a true wyllyng heart: I wyll confesse thy name O God, because it is good.
{54:7} For he hath deliuered me out of all my trouble: and mine eye hath seene auengaunce vpon mine enemies.
{55:1} To the chiefe musition vpon Neginoth, a wise instruction of Dauid. O Lorde geue eare vnto my prayer: and hide not thy selfe from my petition.
{55:2} Take heede vnto me, and heare me: I can not choose but mourne in my prayer, and make a noyse.
{55:3} Deliuer me from the voyce of the enemie, and from the present affliction of the wicked: for they are minded to do me mischiefe, and are set malitiously against me.
{55:4} My heart trembleth within me: and the feare of death is fallen vpon me.
{55:5} Fearefulnes and trembling are come vpon me: and an horrible dread hath ouerwhelmed me.
{55:6} And I sayde, O that I had wynges like a doue: for then woulde I flee away, and be at rest.
{55:7} Lo, then woulde I fleeing get me away farre of: and remayne in the wyldernesse. Selah.
{55:8} Then woulde I make hast to escape: from the stormie wynde, and from the tempest.
{55:9} Destroy their tongues O Lorde, and deuide them: for I haue seene oppression and strife in the citie.
{55:10} They do compasse it day and night within the walles: mischiefe also and labour, are in the midst of it.
{55:11} Malice is in the midst of it: disceipt and guyle go not out of her streates.
{55:12} Truely he was not mine enemie that hath done me this dishonour, for then I coulde haue borne it: neither was he one that seemed to hate me that dyd magnifie hym selfe against me, for then I woulde haue hyd my selfe from him.
{55:13} But it was euen thou whom I esteemed as my selfe: my guyde, and myne owne familier companion.
{55:14} We delighted greatly to conferre our secretes together: we walked deuoutly in the house of God felowe lyke.
{55:15} Let death sodainly come vpon them, let them go downe quicke into hell: for wickednes is in their dwellinges and among them.
{55:16} As for me I wyll crye vnto the Lord: and God wyll saue me.
{55:17} In the euening and morning, and at noone day wyll I pray, and that most instantly: and he wyll heare my voyce.
{55:18} He hath redeemed my soule through peace from the battayle that was against me: for there were many with me.
{55:19} The Lorde who sitteth a ruler from the beginning, wyll heare me and afflict them, Selah: forsomuche as there is no chaunge in them, and for that they do not feare God.
{55:20} He layde his handes vpon such as be at peace with him: and he brake his couenaunt.
{55:21} The wordes of his mouth were softer then butter, yet warre was in his heart: his wordes were smother then oyle, and yet be they very swordes.
{55:22} O cast thy burthen vpon God, and he wyll vpholde thee: he wyll not suffer at any time the righteous to moue.
{55:23} And as for them: thou O Lorde wylt hurle headlong into the pit of destruction. (55:24) The bloodthirstie and deceiptfull men shal not liue out halfe their dayes: neuerthelesse I wyll put my full trust in thee.
{56:1} To the chiefe musition as concerning the dumbe doue in a farre countrey, the golden psalme of Dauid, when the Philistines toke him in Geth. Be mercifull vnto me O Lorde: for man goeth about to deuour me, he dayly fyghtyng, oppresseth me.
{56:2} Myne enemies are dayly in hande to swalowe me vp: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most highest.
{56:3} Neuerthelesse at all times as I am afraide: I put my whole trust in thee.
{56:4} In the Lord I wyll prayse his word: in the Lorde I haue put my trust, and I wyll not feare what flesh can do vnto me.
{56:5} My wordes dayly put me to sorow: all that they do imagine, is to do me euill.
{56:6} They flocke together, they kepe them selues close: they marke my steppes, that they may lye in wayte for my soule.
{56:7} Shall they escape for their wickednes? O Lorde in thy displeasure cast downe headlong this people.
{56:8} Thou hast numbred my flittinges, thou hast put my teares in thy bottell: are not these thinges noted in thy booke?
{56:9} Whensoeuer I call vpon thee, then shall myne enemies be put to flight: this I know, for the Lorde is on my side.
{56:10} In the Lord I wyll prayse the word: In God I wyll prayse the worde.
{56:11} In the Lorde I put my trust: I wyll not be afraide what man can do vnto me.
{56:12} O Lorde, thy vowes be vpon me: vnto thee wyll I geue thankes & praise.
{56:13} For thou hast deliuered my soule from death, and my feete from falling: that I may walke before the Lorde in the light of the liuing.
{57:1} To the chiefe musition (to be song lyke vnto the song beginning) destroy not, a golden psalme of Dauid, when he fled from Saul into the caue. Be mercifull vnto me O Lorde, be mercifull vnto me: for my soule trusteth in thee, and vnder the shadowe of thy wynges wyll I trust, vntyll this tiranny be ouerpast.
{57:2} I wyll call vnto the most high Lorde: euen vnto the Lord that wil perfourme the cause which I haue in hande.
{57:3} He wyll sende from heauen, and saue me from the reproofe of him that woulde deuour me vp, Selah: the Lorde wyll sende foorth his mercie and trueth.
{57:4} My soule is among Lions, and I lye among those that are set on fire: among the children of men whose teeth are speares and arrowes, and their tongue a sharpe sword.
{57:5} Exalt thy selfe O God aboue the heauen: thy glory is aboue all the earth.
{57:6} They haue prepared a net for my feete, that some man might presse downe my soule: they haue digged a pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it them selues. Selah.
{57:7} My heart is redy O Lorde, my heart is redy: I wyll sing, and prayse thee in singing of psalmes.
{57:8} Bestirre thee O my glory, bestirre thee O Lute and Harpe: I my selfe wil bestirre me right early in the morning.
{57:9} I wyll prayse thee O Lorde among the people: and I wyll sing psalmes vnto thee among the nations.
{57:10} For the greatnes of thy mercie reacheth vnto the heauens: and thy trueth vnto the cloudes.
{57:11} Exalt thy selfe O Lord aboue the heauens: let thy glory be aboue al the earth.
{58:1} To the chiefe musition, destroy not, a golden psalme of Dauid. O ye that consult together, pronounce ye truely the thing that is iust? O ye sonnes of men iudge you according to equitie?
{58:2} Nay, rather ye imagine mischiefe in your heart: your handes waygh as in a ballaunce wickednes vpon the earth.
{58:3} The vngodly are straungers euen from their mothers wombe: assoone as they be borne, they go astray and speake a lye.
{58:4} They haue poyson within them lyke to the poyson of a serpent: they be lyke the deafe adder that stoppeth her eares,
{58:5} (58:4) and wyll not heare the voyce of charmers, though he be neuer so skilfull in charming.
{58:6} (58:5) Breake their teeth O Lorde in their mouthes: smite a sunder the chawe bones of Lions O God.
{58:7} (58:6) Let them be dissolued as into water, let them come to naught of them selues: and when they shoote their arrowes, let them be as broken.
{58:8} (58:7) Let them creepe away lyke a snayle that foorthwith consumeth to naught: or lyke the vntimely fruite of a woman, let them not see the sunne.
{58:9} (58:8) As a greene thorne kindled with fyre, goeth out before your pottes be made whot: euen so let a furious rage bring him to naught.
{58:10} (58:9) The righteous wyll reioyce when he seeth the vengeaunce: he wyll washe his foote steppes in the blood of the vngodly.
{58:11} (58:10) And euery man shall say, veryly there is a rewarde for the righteous: doubtlesse there is a God that iudgeth in the earth.
{59:1} To the chiefe musition, destroy not, a golden psalme of Dauid, when Saul sent, and they did watch the house to kill him. Deliuer me from myne enemies O Lorde: defende me fro them that rise vp against me.
{59:2} Deliuer me from the workers of iniquitie: and saue me from the blood thirstie men.
{59:3} For lo, they lye in wayte for my soule: men of power are gathered together against me who haue committed no wickednes nor fault O God.
{59:4} When no fault is done, they runne and set them selues in order: arise to meete me and beholde.
{59:5} And thou O God Lorde of hoastes, Lorde of Israel: awake to visite all Heathen, and be not mercifull vnto all them that offend of malice. Selah.
{59:6} They go to and from at euening: they barke lyke a dogge, and runne about through the citie.
{59:7} Behold they speake with their mouth, swordes are in their lippes: for say they who doth heare vs?
{59:8} But thou O God wylt haue them in derision: thou wylt laugh all Heathen to scorne.
{59:9} I wyl reserue his strength for thee: for thou O Lorde art my refuge.
{59:10} My mercifull Lord wyll preuent me: the Lord will let me see my desire vpon mine enemies.
{59:11} Slay them not, lest my people forget it: but in thy stoutnes scatter them like vagaboundes, and put them downe O God our defence.
{59:12} The wordes of their lippes be the sinne of their mouth: O let them be taken in their pryde, for they speake nothing but curses and lies.
{59:13} Consume them in thy wrath, consume them that nothing of them remayne: and let them knowe that it is the Lord that ruleth in Iacob, & vnto the endes of the worlde. Selah.
{59:14} And let them gad vp and downe at euening: let them barke lyke a dogge, and go about the citie.
{59:15} Let them runne here and there for meate: and go to bed if they be not satisfied.
{59:16} As for me I wyll sing of thy power, and wyll prayse thy louing kindnes betimes in the morning: for thou hast ben my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.
{59:17} Unto thee O my strength will I sing psalmes: for thou O Lorde art my refuge, and my mercyfull Lorde.
{60:1} To the chiefe musition vpon Susan Eduth, a golden psalme of Dauid, for to teache: (made) when he fought against Mesopotamia and Syria of Stobah, and when Ioab turned backe and slue twelue thousande Edomites in the salt valley.) O Lorde thou hast cast vs out, thou hast dispearsed vs, thou art displeased: O turne thee vnto vs agayne.
{60:2} Thou hast made the land to tremble, thou hast cleft it asunder: heale the breaches therof, for it is redy to fall downe.
{60:3} Thou hast made thy people see heauie thinges: thou hast geuen vs wyne to drinke, that maketh vs tremble.
{60:4} But to suche as feare thee: thou hast geuen a banner to be lyfted vp on high for the trueth sake. Selah.
{60:5} Therfore that thy beloued may be deliuered: helpe me with thy right hand, and heare me.
{60:6} The Lorde hath spoken in his holynes (whereof I wyll reioyce) this: I wyll deuide Sichem, and measure the valley of Sucoth.
{60:7} Gilead shalbe myne, and Manasses shalbe myne: Ephraim also shalbe the strength of my head, and Iuda my law geuer.
{60:8} Moab shalbe my washpot: ouer Edom I wyll cast my shoe, Philistea be thou glad of me.
{60:9} Who wyll leade me into the stong citie? who wyll bring me into Edom?
{60:10} Hast not thou remoued vs from thence O Lorde? and wylt not thou O Lorde go out with our hoastes?
{60:11} Geue vs ayde against trouble: for the sauing helpe of man is but vayne.
{60:12} Thorowe the Lorde we wyll do valiaunt actes: for he him selfe wyll treade downe our enemies.
{61:1} To the chiefe musition vpon Neginoth of Dauid. Heare my crying O Lorde: geue eare vnto my prayer.
{61:2} From the endes of the earth I wyll call vnto thee when my heart is in heauines: oh set me vp on the rocke that is higher then I.
{61:3} For thou hast ben my hope: and a strong towre for me against the face of the enemie.
{61:4} I wyll dwell in thy tabernacle for euer: my trust shalbe vnder the couering of thy wynges. Selah.
{61:5} For thou O Lorde hast hearde my vowes: and hast geuen an heritage vnto those that feare thy name.
{61:6} Thou wilt adde dayes vnto the kings dayes: and his yeres shalbe a generation and a generation.
{61:7} He shall dwell before the Lorde for euer: O appoynt thy louing mercy and faithfulnes, that thei may preserue him.
{61:8} So wyll I sing psalmes vnto thy name: that I may day by day perfourme my vowes.
{62:1} To the chiefe musition vpon Iudethun, a psalme of Dauid. My soule truly only stayeth vpon the Lorde: for of him commeth my saluation.
{62:2} He onlye is my rocke and my sauing helpe: he is my refuge, so that I can not be remoued greatly.
{62:3} Howe long wyll ye imagine mischiefe against euery man? ye shalbe slayne all the sort of you: ye shalbe as a tottering wall, and like a broken hedge.
{62:4} They deuise only howe to thrust him from his promotion: they delight in a lye, they blesse with their mouth, and curse with their heart. Selah.
{62:5} Neuerthelesse O my soule, stay thou only vpon the Lorde: for my confidence is in him.
{62:6} He only is my rocke and my sauing helpe: he is my refuge, so that I can not be remoued.
{62:7} In the Lorde is my health and my glory: my trust is in the Lorde the fortresse of my force.
{62:8} O ye people, put your trust in hym alway: powre out your heartes before him, for the Lorde is our hope. Selah.
{62:9} As for the chyldren of men, they be onlye but vanitie, the chyldren of lordes be but a lye: vpon the wayghtes they be altogether lighter then vanitie in selfe.
{62:10} O trust not in wrong dealing and spoyling: geue not your selues vnto vanitie, if riches encrease, set not your heart vpon them.
{62:11} The Lord spake it once, but I haue hearde it twise, that power and mercy belongeth to thee O Lorde God:
{62:12} (62:11) for thou rewardest euery man according to his worke.
{63:1} A psalme of Dauid when he was in the wyldernesse of Iuda. O Lorde thou art my Lorde: early in the morning I do seeke thee. (63:2) My soule thirsteth for thee: my fleshe also longeth after thee in a baren and drye lande where no water is.
{63:2} (63:3) To see thee euen so as I haue seene thee in the sanctuary: that I might beholde thy power and glory.
{63:3} (63:4) For thy louing kindnes is better then life itselfe: my lippes shall prayse thee.
{63:4} (63:5) As long as I liue I wyll blesse thee on this maner: and in thy name I wyll lyft vp my handes.
{63:5} (63:6) My soule is satisfied euen as it were with mary and fatnes: and my mouth prayseth thee with ioyfull lippes.
{63:6} (63:7) Haue I not remembred thee in my bed: and thought vpon thee when I was waking?
{63:7} (63:8) Because thou hast ben my helper: therfore vnder the shadowe of thy wynges do I reioyce.
{63:8} (63:9) My soule cleaueth fast vnto thee: thy right hande hath vpholden me.
{63:9} (63:10) And they that seeke my soule to oppresse it: shall go vnder the earth.
{63:10} (63:11) Euery one of them shalbe killed with the edge of a sworde: and they shalbe a portion for Foxes.
{63:11} (63:12) But the king shal reioyce in the Lord, al they shal glory that sweare by him: for the mouth of all them that speake a lye, shalbe stopped.
{64:1} To the chiefe musition, a psalme of Dauid. O Lorde heare my voyce in my prayer: preserue my life from feare of the enemie.
{64:2} Hyde me from the secrete counsayles of the malitious: from the conspiracie of the workers of iniquitie.
{64:3} Who haue whet their tongue lyke a sword: who haue drawne their arrow, euen a bitter worde.
{64:4} That they may priuily shoote at hym which is perfect: they do sodenly shoote at hym and feare not.
{64:5} They courage them selues in mischiefe: and comune among them selues how they may lay snares, and say, who shall see them?
{64:6} They searche out howe to do wrong, they put in practise fully that they haue diligently searched out: yea euen the secretes and bottome of euery one of their heartes.
{64:7} But the Lorde wyll sodenly shoote at them with a swyft arrowe: their plagues shalbe apparaunt.
{64:8} Yea they shall cause their owne tongues to be a meanes for to destroy the selues: insomuch that who so seeth them, shal desire to flee away from them
{64:9} And all men that see it shall say, this hath God done: for they shall well perceaue that it is his worke.
{64:10} The righteous wyll reioyce in God, and put his trust in hym: and all they that be vpright hearted wylbe glad.
{65:1} To the chiefe musition, the psalme of Dauid, a song. O Lorde thou wylt be greatly praysed in Sion: and vnto thee shal vowes be perfourmed
{65:2} Thou that hearest a prayer: vnto thee shall all fleshe come.
{65:3} My misdeedes haue preuayled against me: oh be thou mercifull vnto our wicked transgressions.
{65:4} Blessed is the man whom thou choosest and receauest vnto thee: he shall dwell in thy court, and we shalbe satisfied with the goodnes of thy house, euen of thy holy temple.
{65:5} Thou wylt heare vs, doyng wonderfull thinges in righteousnes O Lorde of our saluation: thou art the hope of all endes of the earth, and of them that dwell farre of at the sea coast.
{65:6} Thou art he who in his strength setleth fast the mountaines: and is gyrded about with power.
{65:7} Who stilleth the raging of the sea, and the noyse of his waues: and the vprore of the people.
{65:8} They also that dwel in the vtmost partes of the earth be afrayde at thy signes: thou makest them reioyce at the going foorth of the morning and euenyng.
{65:9} Thou visitest the earth, and thou makest it ouerflowne, thou enrichest it greatly: the riuer of God is full of water, thou preparest their corne, for so thou ordaynest it.
{65:10} Thou waterest her forowes, thou breakest downe her hillockes: thou makest it soft with the drops of rayne, and blessest the increase of it.
{65:11} Thou crownest the yere with thy goodnes: and thy cloudes drop fatnes.
{65:12} They drop vpon the dwellinges of the wyldernesse: and hilles be compassed with ioy.
{65:13} The downes be couered with sheepe: the valleys stande thicke with corne so that they showte for ioy and also sing.
{66:1} To the chiefe musition, a song (whiche is) a psalme. Declare you ioyfull vnto the Lorde all ye of the earth:
{66:2} (66:1) sing psalmes vnto the glory of his name, geue glory to his maiestie.
{66:3} (66:2) Say vnto the Lorde, oh howe wonderfull art thou in thy workes: thorow the greatnes of thy power thyne enemies shalbe founde liers vnto thee.
{66:4} (66:3) For all they of the worlde shall worship thee, and sing psalmes vnto thee: they shall sing psalmes vnto thy holy name. Selah.
{66:5} (66:4) Come hither and beholde the workes of the Lorde: howe wonderfull he is in his doing towarde the chyldren of men.
{66:6} (66:5) He turneth the sea into drye lande, so that they went thorowe the water on foote: there dyd we reioyce in him.
{66:7} (66:6) He ruleth with his power for euer, his eyes beholdeth the gentiles: such as be rebels shal not come to promotion. Selah.
{66:8} (66:7) O ye people blesse your Lorde: and make the voyce of his praise to be heard.
{66:9} (66:8) Who preserueth our soule in life: and suffereth not our feete to slip.
{66:10} (66:9) For thou O Lord hast proued vs: thou hast tryed vs, like as siluer is tryed.
{66:11} (66:10) Thou broughtest vs into the snare: and layde trouble vpon our loynes.
{66:12} (66:11) Thou sufferedst men to ride ouer our heades: we went through fire and water, and yet thou broughtest vs out into a pleasaunt place.
{66:13} (66:12) I wyll go into thy house with burnt offeringes: and I wyll pay thee my vowes
{66:14} (66:12) whiche I promised with my lippes, and spake with my mouth when I was in trouble.
{66:15} (66:13) I wyll offer vnto thee fat burnt sacrifices, with the incense of rammes: I will offer bullockes and goates. Selah.
{66:16} (66:14) O come hither, & hearken: and I wil tell all you that feare the Lorde, what he hath done for my soule.
{66:17} (66:15) I called vnto hym with my mouth: and I exalted him with my tongue.
{66:18} (66:16) If I had inclined vnto wickednes in my heart, the Lorde woulde not haue hearde me:
{66:19} (66:16) but the Lorde hath hearde me, & considered the voyce of my prayer.
{66:20} (66:17) Blessed be the Lorde which hath not reiected my prayer: nor turned his mercye from me.
{67:1} To the chiefe musition vpon Neginoth, a psalme (whiche is) a song. The Lord be mercyfull vnto vs and blesse vs: and cause the light of his coutenaunce to shine vpon vs. Selah.
{67:2} That thy way may be knowen vpon the earth: thy saluation among all nations.
{67:3} Then wyll the people prayse thee O Lorde: yea all the people wyll prayse thee.
{67:4} The Gentiles will reioyce & triumph: for thou wylt iudge the people, and gouerne the gentiles vpon the earth, according to equitie. Selah.
{67:5} The people will prayse thee O Lord: all the people wyll prayse thee.
{67:6} Then shall the earth bryng foorth her increase: and the Lorde our Lord will geue vs his blessing.
{67:7} The Lorde will blesse vs: and all the endes of the worlde shall feare him.
{68:1} To the chiefe musition, a psalme of Dauid, which is a song. In case the Lorde woulde aryse, his enemies woulde be scattered: and they that hate hym woulde flee from his face.
{68:2} Lyke as the smoke vanisheth, so wylt thou cause them to vanishe away: and lyke as water melteth at the fire, so wyll the vngodly perishe at the presence of the Lorde.
{68:3} But the ryghteous must be glad, and reioyce before the Lorde: they shall not stande styll for myrth.
{68:4} Syng vnto the Lorde, syng psalmes vnto his name: magnifie hym that rideth vpon the heauens as it were vpon an horse in his name euerlastyng, and reioyce before his face.
{68:5} He is a father of the fatherlesse, and the iudge of widdowes: he is the Lord in his holy habitation.
{68:6} He is the Lord that maketh those that dwell alone to haue a familie: and bryngeth prisoners out of the stockes.
{68:7} But rebelles did inhabite a dry ground O Lorde, when thou wentest foorth before the people: when thou wentest through the wyldernesse. Selah.
{68:8} The earth shoke, and the heauens dropped at the presence of the Lorde: euen Sinai it selfe shoke at the presence of the Lorde, Lorde of Israel.
{68:9} Thou O Lorde dydst cause rayne to fall at thy gratious pleasure: and when thine inheritaunce was weery, thou dydst hearten it.
{68:10} Thy flocke dwelleth there: for thou O Lorde doest of thy goodnesse prepare for the poore.
{68:11} The Lorde gaue the worde: great was the company of the preachers.
{68:12} Kynges with their armies dyd flee: they dyd flee, and the ornament of an house deuided the spoyle.
{68:13} Though ye haue lyen among the pottes: yet shall ye be as the wynges of a doue that is couered with siluer, and hath her fethers as yelowe as golde.
{68:14} When the almightie scattered kynges in it: it was as whyte as snowe in Salmon.
{68:15} As the hyll of Basan, so is Gods hill: euen an hygh hyll, as the hyll of Basan.
{68:16} Why skyp you so the high hylles? this is the Lordes hyll in the which it pleaseth hym to dwell, yea God wyll abyde in it for euer.
{68:17} The charettes of the Lorde are twentie thousande, euen thousandes of angels: and the Lorde is among them in holy Sinai.
{68:18} Thou wenst vp on high, thou hast led captiuitie captiue, thou hast receaued gyftes for men: yea euen for those that be disobedient, that God the Lorde myght dwell among them,
{68:19} Blessed be the Lorde who day by day powreth his benefites vpon vs: and is God of our saluation. Selah.
{68:20} The Lorde is our Lorde for to saue vs: and all maner of wayes for death pertayneth to God the Lorde.
{68:21} God wyll wounde the head of his enemies: and the heary scalpe of hym who goeth on styll in his wickednesse.
{68:22} The Lorde hath sayde, I wyll bryng my people agayne out from Basan: I wyll bryng them agayne out from the deepe of the sea.
{68:23} That thy footes and the tongue of thy dogges: may be made redde in the blood of the enemies by his meanes.
{68:24} They do well see O Lorde thy goynges: thy goynges in the sanctuarie my Lorde and kyng.
{68:25} The singers go before, the minstrelles folowe after: in the myddest are the damselles playing with the timbrelles.
{68:26} In the congregations they do blesse the Lorde: the God of the fountayne of Israel.
{68:27} There is litle Beniamin their ruler, & the princes of Iehuda their counsell: the princes of Zabulon and the princes of Nepthali.
{68:28} Thy Lord hath ordeyned thy strength: establishe the thing O Lorde that thou hast wrought in vs.
{68:29} For thy temple sake at Hierusalem: kynges wyll bryng presentes vnto thee.
{68:30} Put to rebuke the companie of speare men, a multitude of bulles amongest the people lyke vnto calues: vntyll that they brought vnder foote come with peeces of siluer for tribute, scatter the people that delyght in warre.
{68:31} Then shal princes come out of Egypt: Ethiopia in all haste shall stretch out her handes vnto the Lorde.
{68:32} Sing vnto the Lord O ye kingdomes of the earth: O syng psalmes vnto the Lorde. Selah.
{68:33} Who rydeth vpon the most hyghest eternall heauens: lo he sendeth out a mightie voyce in his voyce.
{68:34} Acknowledge the Lorde to be mightie: his maiestie is ouer Israel, & might in the cloudes.
{68:35} O Lorde thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel geueth myght and strength vnto his people, Blessed be the Lorde.
{69:1} To the chiefe musition vpon Sosanim (a psalme) of Dauid. Saue me O Lorde: for waters haue entred in vnto my soule.
{69:2} I am ouer the head in deepe myre where I feele no grounde: I plunge in deepe waters where the streame ouerwhelmeth me.
{69:3} I am weery of crying, my throte is drye: my syght fayleth me through the long attendaunce that I haue geuen vpon my Lorde.
{69:4} They that hate me without a cause are mo then the heeres of my head: they that are myne enemies and woulde destroy me giltlesse are mightie, I payde them the thynges that I neuer toke.
{69:5} God thou knowest my folly: and my faultes are not hyd from thee.
{69:6} Let not them that trust in thee O Lorde God of hoastes, be for my cause ashamed: let not those that seke thee, be through me confounded O Lorde of Israel.
{69:7} For thy sake haue I suffered reprofe, shame hath couered my face:
{69:8} (69:7) I am become a straunger vnto my brethren, euen an aliaunt vnto my mothers children.
{69:9} (69:8) For the zeale of thine house hath euen eaten me: and the rebukes of them that rebuked thee, are fallen vpon me.
{69:10} (69:9) And I wept chastenyng my soule with fastyng: and that was turned to my reproofe.
{69:11} (69:10) Also I put on sackcloth for my garment: and they iested at me.
{69:12} (69:11) They that sit in the gate speake agaynst me: and they that drynke strong drynke make songes vpon me.
{69:13} (69:12) But I make my prayer vnto thee O God in an acceptable tyme: heare me O Lord in the multitude of thy mercie, according to the trueth of thy saluation.
{69:14} (69:13) Take me out of the myre, that I sincke not: oh let me be delyuered from them that hate me, & out of the deepe waters.
{69:15} (69:14) Let not the water fludde drowne me, neither let the deepe swalowe me vp: & let not the pyt shut her mouth vpon me.
{69:16} (69:15) Heare me O God, for thy louyng kindnesse is comfortable: turne thee vnto me accordyng vnto the multitude of thy mercies.
{69:17} (69:16) And hyde not thy face from thy seruaunt, for I am in trouble: O haste thee and heare me.
{69:18} (69:17) Draw nigh vnto my soule & redeeme it: for myne enemies sake oh redeeme me.
{69:19} (69:18) Thou hast knowen my reproofe, my shame, and my dishonour: myne aduersaries are all in thy syght.
{69:20} (69:19) Reproofe hath broke my heart a peeces, I am full of heauinesse: I loked for some to haue pitie on me, but there was none, and for some that shoulde comfort me, but I coulde fynde none.
{69:21} (69:20) They gaue me for meate, gall to eate: and when I was thirstie, they gaue me vineger to drynke.
{69:22} (69:21) Let their table be as a snare before them: and in steade of aboundaunce of peace, let it be a meanes of destruction.
{69:23} (69:22) Let their eyes be blynded that they see not: and euer bowe downe their loynes.
{69:24} (69:23) Powre out thine indignation vpon them: and let thy wrathfull displeasure take holde of them.
{69:25} (69:24) Let their habitation be desolate: and let no man dwell in their tabernacles.
{69:26} (69:25) For they persecute hym whom thou hast smitten: and they talke of the griefe of them whom thou hast wounded.
{69:27} (69:26) Let them fall from one wickednesse to another: and let them not enter into thy ryghteousnesse.
{69:28} (69:27) Let them be wyped out of the booke of the lyuyng: and not to be written among the ryghteous.
{69:29} (69:28) As for me I am afflicted and in heauinesse: thy sauing helpe O Lorde shal defende me.
{69:30} (69:29) I wyll prayse the name of the Lorde with a song: and magnifie hym with a solemne confession.
{69:31} (69:30) And it wyll please God: better then a bullocke that hath hornes and hoofes.
{69:32} (69:31) The humble wyll consider this and be glad, such as seke after God: and your soule shall lyue.
{69:33} (69:32) For God heareth the poore: & dispiseth not his prisoners.
{69:34} (69:33) Let heauen and earth prayse hym: the sea and all that moueth therin.
{69:35} (69:34) For the Lorde wyll saue Sion, and builde the cities of Iehuda: that men may dwel there and haue it in possession.
{69:36} (69:35) The posteritie also of his seruauntes shall inherite it: and they that loue his name shall dwell therin.
{70:1} To the chiefe musition (a psalme) of Dauid, to reduce in remembraunce. Haste thee O Lorde to delyuer me: make haste to helpe me O God.
{70:2} Let them be ashamed and confounded that seke after my soule: let them be turned backwarde and be put to confusion that wishe me euyll.
{70:3} Let them be returned backwarde: for a rewarde of their shamyng other which say, there, there.
{70:4} But let all those that seke thee be ioyfull and glad in thee: and let all such as delight in thy saluation say alway, the Lorde be magnified.
{70:5} As for me I am poore and in miserie, hasten thee vnto me O Lorde: thou art my ayde and my delyuerer, O God make no long tarying.
{71:1} In thee O God I haue put my trust, let me neuer be put to confusion:
{71:2} (71:1) ridde me and deliuer me in thy ryghteousnesse, incline thine eare vnto me, and saue me.
{71:3} (71:2) Be thou my strong holde whervnto I may alway resort: thou hast geuen a charge to saue me, for thou art my house of defence, and my castell.
{71:4} (71:3) Delyuer me O my Lorde out of the hande of the vngodly: out of the hande of the vnryghteous and cruell man.
{71:5} (71:4) For thou O Lorde God art the thyng that I long for: thou art my hope euen from my youth.
{71:6} (71:5) Through thee haue I ben mayntayned euer since I was borne: thou art he that toke me out of my mothers wombe, my praise shalbe alway of thee.
{71:7} (71:6) I am become as it were a monster vnto many: but my sure trust is in thee.
{71:8} (71:7) Oh let my mouth be fylled: with thy prayse and glorie all the day long.
{71:9} (71:8) Cast me not away in the tyme of age: forsake me not when my strength fayleth me.
{71:10} (71:9) For myne enemies speake against me: and they that lay awayte for my soule take their counsayle together.
{71:11} (71:10) They say, the Lorde hath forsaken hym: do you persecute hym and take hym, for there is none to delyuer hym.
{71:12} (71:11) Go not farre from me O Lorde: haste thee O my Lorde to helpe me.
{71:13} (71:12) Let them be confounded, let them be brought to naught that are agaynst my soule: let them be couered with shame and dishonour that seke to do me euyll.
{71:14} (71:13) As for me I wyll patiently wayte alway: and I wyll prayse thee more and more.
{71:15} (71:14) My mouth shall dayly speake of thy ryghteousnesse and saluation: for I knowe no ende therof.
{71:16} (71:15) I wyll go foorth in the strength of the Lorde God: and I wyll only make mention of thy ryghteousnesse.
{71:17} (71:16) Thou O God hast taught me from my youth: and hytherto I can well declare thy wonderous workes.
{71:18} (71:17) Wherfore whylest I am olde and am gray headed: O Lorde forsake me not, vntyll I haue shewed thy arme vnto this generation, and thy power to all them that are yet for to come.
{71:19} (71:18) And vntyll I haue exceedyngly exalted O Lorde thy ryghteousnesse: for great thynges are they that thou hast done, O Lorde who is lyke vnto thee?
{71:20} (71:19) Which hast made me to feele many great troubles and aduersities: yet returnyng thou hast reuyued me, yea returnyng thou hast caused me to come out from the bottome of the earth.
{71:21} (71:20) Thou hast brought me to greater honour then I had before: & thou returnyng hast comforted me on euery syde.
{71:22} (71:21) Therfore I wyll confesse vnto thee thy trueth O Lorde, playing vpon an instrument of musicke: vnto thee I wyl syng psalmes vpon the harpe O thou most holy God of Israel.
{71:23} (71:22) My lyppes wyll be ioyfull when I syng vnto thee: and so wyll my soule which thou hast redeemed.
{71:24} (71:23) My tongue also shal talke of thy righteousnesse all the day long: for they are confounded and brought vnto shame that seke to do me euyll.
{72:1} Of Solomon. O God geue vnto the kyng thy iudgementes: and thy ryghteousnesse vnto the kynges sonne.
{72:2} Then he wyll iudge thy people accordyng vnto iustice: and thy afflicted accordyng to equitie.
{72:3} The mountaynes also and hylles: shall bryng peace to the people by the meanes of ryghteousnesse.
{72:4} He wyll iudge the afflicted amongst the people: he wyll saue the children of the poore, and subdue the oppressour.
{72:5} They wyll feare thee as long as the sunne and moone shyneth: from one generation to another.
{72:6} He wyll come downe lyke the rayne into a fleece of wooll: euen as the droppes that water the earth.
{72:7} In his dayes the ryghteous wyll florishe: and there shalbe aboundaunce of peace so long as the moone endureth.
{72:8} His dominion also shalbe from the one sea to the other: and from the fludde vnto the ende of the earth.
{72:9} They that dwell in the wildernesse shal kneele before him: his enemies shal licke the dust.
{72:10} The kyng of Tharsis and of the Iles shall offer presentes: the kynges of Sheba & Seba shall bring giftes.
{72:11} All kynges wyll worshyp hym: all nations wyll do hym seruice.
{72:12} For he wyll delyuer the poore when he cryeth: and the afflicted and hym that hath no helper.
{72:13} He wyll haue compassion vpon the poore and needy: and he wyll preserue the soules of the poore.
{72:14} He wyll delyuer their soules from deceipt and oppression: and their blood shalbe in his syght.
{72:15} He wyll lyue, and he wyll geue to the poore of the golde of Sheba: and he wyll pray alwayes for hym, and dayly he wyll blesse hym.
{72:16} A handfull of corne shall be sowed in the earth vpon the toppe of hylles: and the fruite therof shall make a noyse lyke Libanus, and shall florishe in the citie lyke grasse vpon the earth.
{72:17} His name shall endure for euer, his name shalbe spread abrode to the world so long as the sunne shall shyne: all nations shalbe blessed in hym, and shall call hym blessed.
{72:18} Blessed be God the Lorde: the Lorde of Israel which only doth wonderous thynges.
{72:19} And blessed be the name of his maiestie for euer: and all the earth shalbe fylled with his maiestie. Amen, Amen.
{72:20} Here endeth the prayers of Dauid the sonne of Isai.
{73:1} A psalme of Asaph. Truely the Lorde is very good vnto Israel: vnto such as haue a cleane heart.
{73:2} Neuerthelesse, my feete were almost gone from me: my steppes had almost slypt.
{73:3} For I enuied at the case of the foolishe: I sawe the wicked flowe in all kynde of prosperitie.
{73:4} For there be no bondes of death that can holde them: and the galaries of their houses be strong.
{73:5} They come in no misfortune lyke other folke: neither are they plagued lyke other men.
{73:6} And this is the cause that pride compasse them rounde about: and crueltie couereth them as a garment.
{73:7} Their eyes stande out for fatnesse: and the cogitations of their heartes do passe from them.
{73:8} They make other dissolute, they speake oppression with iniurie: they talke proudely and presumptuously.
{73:9} For they stretch foorth their mouth vnto the heauen: and their tongue goeth through the worlde.
{73:10} Therfore God his people turneth thither: and there is drawen vnto them waters in a full cuppe.
{73:11} And they say, howe shoulde God perceaue it? is there knowledge in the most hyghest?
{73:12} Lo these vngodly and fortunate in the worlde: do possesse riches.
{73:13} Truely I haue cleansed my heart in vayne: and wasshed my handes in innocencie.
{73:14} All the day long I haue ben scourged: and chastened euery mornyng.
{73:15} If I shoulde say that I woulde iudge after this sort: lo then I shoulde condempne the generation of thy children.
{73:16} Therfore I considered howe I might vnderstande this: but it was to paynefull in myne eyes.
{73:17} Untyll I went vnto the sanctuarie of God: and vnderstood the ende of them.
{73:18} Truely thou doest set them in slippery places: and castest them downe headlong for to be destroyed.
{73:19} Oh howe be they brought to a destruction euen vpon a sodayne: they faynt, they consume away for very dread.
{73:20} They be as a dreame to a man after he is once waked: O Lorde thou wylt cause their image to be dispised in the citie.
{73:21} Ueryly thus was my heart inflamed: thus was my reynes pricked.
{73:22} So foolishe was I and voyde of vnderstanding: I was euen a bruite beast before thee.
{73:23} Neuerthelesse I am alway with thee: for thou hast holden me by my ryght hande.
{73:24} Thou hast guyde me with thy counsayle: and after that thou receauedst me with glorie.
{73:25} Whom haue I in heauen but thee? and there is none vpon earth that I desire besides thee.
{73:26} My fleshe and my heart fayleth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for euer.
{73:27} For lo, they that kepe them selues a loofe from thee shall perishe: thou destroyest euery one that committeth fornication agaynst thee.
{73:28} But it is good for me to come neare vnto God: wherfore I put my trust in thee O Lorde God, that I may declare all thy workes.
{74:1} A wise instruction (to be song) of Asaph. O Lorde wherfore dost thou forsake vs altogether? wherfore breaketh foorth thy anger agaynst the sheepe of thy pasture.
{74:2} Remember thy congregation, thou hast possest it nowe a long tyme: thou hast redeemed the rodde of thine inheritaunce, euen mount Sion wherein thou dwellest.
{74:3} Lyft vp thy feete for to destroy vtterly euery enemie: which hath done euyll in thy sanctuarie.
{74:4} Thyne aduersaries roare in the myddest of thy congregations: and set vp their banners for signes of victorie.
{74:5} He that hewed tymber afore out of thicke woddes for to builde the temple: was esteemed as one offeryng a present to God aboue.
{74:6} But nowe they breake downe into peeces all the carued worke therof: with axes and hammers.
{74:7} They haue set fire on thy holy places: they haue defiled the dwellyng place of thy name castyng it downe to the groud.
{74:8} Yea, they sayde in their heartes, let vs make hauocke of them altogether: thus haue they burnt vp all the houses of God in the lande.
{74:9} We see not our ensignes, there is not one prophete more: no not one is there amongst vs that vnderstandeth our case.
{74:10} O Lorde shall the aduersarie do this dishonour continually? shall the enemie blaspheme thy name for euer?
{74:11} Why withdrawest thou thy hande, yea thy right hande? consume them, drawing it out of thy bosome.
{74:12} Truely God is my kyng of olde: who worketh saluation in the myddest of the earth.
{74:13} Thou didst deuide the sea through thy power: thou brakest the heades of the dragons in the waters.
{74:14} Thou smotest the heades of Leuiathan in peeces: and gauest hym to be meate for the people in wildernesse.
{74:15} Thou broughtest out fountaynes and waters out of the harde rockes: thou dyddest drye vp mightie waters.
{74:16} The day is thine, & the nyght is thine: thou hast prepared the light & the sunne.
{74:17} Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast ordeyned summer and wynter.
{74:18} Remember this O God, the enemie hath dishonoured: and the foolishe people hath blasphemed thy name.
{74:19} O deliuer not the soule of thy turtle doue vnto a wylde beast: forget not the congregation of the poore for euer.
{74:20} Loke vpon the couenaunt: for darknesse of the earth hath replenisshed houses with iniquitie.
{74:21} O let not the simple go away ashamed: but let the afflicted & needy geue prayse vnto thy name.
{74:22} Arise O Lord, mayntayne thine owne cause: remember the dishonour that the foolishe man doth vnto thee dayly.
{74:23} Forget not the voyce of thine enemies: the mutteryng of them that hate thee ascendeth vp continually.
{75:1} To the chiefe musition, destroy not; the psalme of Asaph, a song. We do confesse it vnto thee O lord, we do confesse it: for thy wonderous workes do declare thy name to be at hande.
{75:2} When I shall take tyme fyt for the purpose: I wyll iudge accordyng vnto ryght.
{75:3} The earth wasteth and all the inhabitours therof: I haue vpholded the pyllours of it. Selah.
{75:4} I sayd vnto fooles deale not so madly: & to the vngodly set not vp your horne.
{75:5} Set not vp your horne an high: and speake not with a stiffe necke.
{75:6} Because promotion commeth neither from the east nor from the west: nor yet from the south.
{75:7} For God is the iudge: it is he that putteth downe one, and setteth vp another.
{75:8} For in the hande of God there is a cup, and the wine is redde: it is full mixt, and he powreth out the same. (75:9) But the vngodly of the earth do wring out: and drynke the dregges therof.
{75:9} (75:10) As for me I wyll euer set foorth in wordes the Lorde: I wyll sing psalmes to the God of Iacob.
{75:10} (75:11) And I wyll breake all the hornes of the vngodly: but the hornes of the ryghteous shalbe exalted.
{76:1} To the chiefe musition in Neginoth, the psalme of Asaph, a song. In Iurie is God knowen: his name is great in Israel.
{76:2} At Shalem is his tabernacle: and his dwellyng in Sion.
{76:3} There he brake the arrowes of the bowe: the shielde, the sworde, and the battayle. Selah.
{76:4} Thou art honourable: and of more puissaunce then the mountaynes of robbers.
{76:5} The hygh couragious stomackes are spoyled, they haue slept their slepe: and the valiaunt souldiours coulde not finde their owne handes.
{76:6} At thy rebuke O God of Iacob: both the charet and horse be brought to naught.
{76:7} Thou, euen thou art dreadfull: and who may stande in thy syght when thou begynnest to be angry?
{76:8} Thou causest thy iudgement to be hearde from heauen: then the earth trembleth, and is styll.
{76:9} When God ariseth to iudgement: and to helpe all the afflicted vpon the earth. Selah.
{76:10} The fearcenesse of man shall turne to thy prayse: and the remnaunt of the fearcenesse thou wylt restrayne.
{76:11} Make vowes vnto God your Lorde, & perfourme them all ye that be rounde about hym: bryng presentes vnto hym that is dreadfull.
{76:12} He abateth the spirite of princes: he is dreadfull to the kynges of the earth.
{77:1} To the chiefe musition vpon Ieduthun, a psalme of Asaph. My voyce was vnto the Lorde, and I cryed: my voyce was vnto the Lord, and he hearkened vnto me.
{77:2} In the tyme of my trouble I sought the Lorde: my hande all the nyght catched & ceassed not, my soule refused comfort.
{77:3} I called to remembraunce God, and I was disquieted: I conferred with my selfe, and my spirite was wrapped in pensiuenesse. Selah.
{77:4} Thou dydst kepe the watche of mine eies: I was amased & coulde not speake.
{77:5} I dyd thynke vpon the dayes past: and on the yeres of the olde worlde.
{77:6} I called to remembraunce my psalme, song on the musicall instrument in the nyght tyme: I communed with myne owne heart, & searched out my spirites.
{77:7} What, wyll the Lorde forsake me for euer? wyll he be no more intreated to be fauourable?
{77:8} Is his mercie cleane gone for euer? and is his promise made from one generation to another, come vtterly to an ende.
{77:9} Hath God forgotten to be gratious? and will he shut vp his louing kindnesse in displeasure? Selah.
{77:10} And I sayde, this is my death: but the ryght hande of the most hyghest may graunt me yeres.
{77:11} I dyd call to remebraunce the workes of God almightie: for thy wonders done a great whyle a goe came into my mynde.
{77:12} I also gaue my selfe to muse of all thy workes: and I talked of all thy actes.
{77:13} Thy way O Lorde is in holynesse: who is so great a God as the Lorde?
{77:14} Thou art the God that doth wonders: thou hast made thy power knowen among the people.
{77:15} Thou hast redeemed thy people with a mightie arme: the sonnes of Iacob and Ioseph. Selah.
{77:16} The waters sawe thee O God, the waters sawe thee, they feared: yea the depthes of them moued out of their place.
{77:17} Thicke cloudes powred downe rayne, thinne cloudes gaue a noyse: and thine arrowes went abrode into al corners.
{77:18} The sounde of thy thunder was rounde about the sky: the lightnynges shone through the worlde, the earth quaked and trembled.
{77:19} Thy way is in the sea, and thy pathes in the great waters: and thy footesteppes are not knowen.
{77:20} Thou dydst leade thy people lyke sheepe: by the hande of Moyses and Aaron.
{78:1} A wise instruction of Asaph. Heare my lawe O my people: enclyne your eares vnto the wordes of my mouth.
{78:2} I wyll open my mouth in a parable: I wyll declare harde sentences of the olde tyme past.
{78:3} Which we haue hearde and knowen: and such as our fathers haue tolde vs.
{78:4} We wyll not hyde them from their children: nay we wyll set foorth in wordes to the generation to come, the prayses of God, and his myght and wonderfull workes that he hath done.
{78:5} For he reuiued a statute in Iacob, and gaue Israel a lawe: in the whiche he commaunded our forefathers to teache their children.
{78:6} To the intent the posteritie shoulde knowe it, and children whiche shalbe borne: that they shoulde ryse vp and declare it to their children.
{78:7} That they shoulde put their trust in God, and not forget the workes of God: but kepe his commaundementes.
{78:8} And that they be not as their forefathers were a rebellious and a mutable generation: a generation that directed not their heart aright, and whose spirite cleaued not stedfastly vnto God.
{78:9} Like as the children of Ephraim, which beyng harnessed & carying bowes: turned their backes in the day of battayle.
{78:10} They kept not the couenaunt of God: and they woulde not walke in his law.
{78:11} But they forgat his workes: and his wonders which he had shewed them.
{78:12} Marueylous thinges dyd he in the sight of their fathers: in the land of Egypt, in the fielde of Zoan.
{78:13} He deuided the sea and let them go thorowe: he made the waters to stande as on an heape.
{78:14} In the day time also he led them with a cloude: and all the night through with a light of fire.
{78:15} He cloued the harde rockes in the wildernes: & gaue them drinke therof, as it had ben out of the great deepe waters.
{78:16} He brought running streames out of a stonie rocke: and caused waters to gushe downe, like as out of riuers.
{78:17} Yet for all this they sinned still against hym: so that they prouoked the most hyghest in the wildernesse.
{78:18} And they temped god in their heartes: in requiring meate for their lust.
{78:19} They spake against God: they said, can God prepare a table in the wildernesse?
{78:20} Beholde, he hath smytten the stonie rocke, and waters haue gushed out, and streames haue flowed out aboundantly: but can he likewise geue bread, can he prouide fleshe for his people?
{78:21} Wherefore God hearde them, he was wroth, a fire was kindled in Iacob: and there arose vp heauy displeasure against Israel.
{78:22} Because they beleued not in the Lord: nor did put their trust in his saluation.
{78:23} And yet he commaunded the cloudes aboue: and opened the doores of heauen.
{78:24} He raigned downe Manna also vpon them, that they shoulde eate: and gaue them corne from heauen.
{78:25} So man dyd eate the bread of angels: he sent them meate inough.
{78:26} He remoued the east winde from vnder the heauen: and through his power he brought in the south winde.
{78:27} He rained fleshe vpon them as thycke as dust: and fethered foules like as the sande of the sea.
{78:28} He let it fall among their tentes: euen rounde about their pauilions.
{78:29} So they dyd eate and were wel filled, for he gaue them their owne desire: neuerthelesse they were not alienated from their lust.
{78:30} But whyle the meate was yet in their mouthes, the heauy wrath of God came vpon them, and slue the welthyest of them: and made the chosen men of Israel to stoupe.
{78:31} For all this they sinned still: and beleued not his wonderous workes.
{78:32} Therfore their dayes dyd he consume in vanitie: & their yeres in a short troublous time.
{78:33} When he slue them, they sought hym: they repented them, and made God their morninges worke.
{78:34} And they remembred that the Lorde was their rocke: & that the Lorde most hyghest was their redeemer.
{78:35} Neuerthelesse they dyd but flatter him with their mouth: and they made hym a lye with their tongue.
{78:36} For their heart was not vpright with him: neither continued they faythfull in his couenaunt.
{78:37} Yet for all that he beyng most merciful: cleane pardoned all their misdeedes, and destroyed them not.
{78:38} Yea many a tyme he dyd much for to represse his anger: and neuer woulde suffer his whole rage to breake out.
{78:39} For he considered that they were but fleshe, and that they were euen a winde that passeth away & cometh not againe.
{78:40} How oft dyd they prouoke hym in the wildernes: & greeued hym in the desert?
{78:41} They turned backe and tempted the Lorde: and prescribed boundes to the most holy God of Israel.
{78:42} They thought not of his hande: in the day when he redeemed them from the enemie.
{78:43} Howe he had wrought his miracles in Egypt: and his wonders in the fielde of Zoan.
{78:44} For he turned into blood their riuers & fluddes: so that they might not drinke.
{78:45} He sent amongst them all kind of flyes who dyd eate them: and frogges who destroyed them.
{78:46} He gaue their fruites vnto the caterpiller: & their labour to the grashopper.
{78:47} He destroyed their vines with hayle stones: and their wilde figge trees with the harde frost.
{78:48} He smote their cattell also with haylestones: and their flockes with thunder boltes.
{78:49} He cast vpon them the rage of his furie, anger, disdayne, and trouble: by sending foorth euill angels amongst them.
{78:50} He made away to his indignation, & spared not their soule from death: he gaue their lyfe to be subiect to the pestilence.
{78:51} And he smote all the first borne of Egypt: the first fruites of concupiscence in the pauilions of Cham.
{78:52} But as for his owne people, he led them foorth like sheepe: and conducted them through the wildernesse like a flocke of cattell.
{78:53} He brought them out safely that they shoulde not feare: and ouerwhelmed their enemies with the sea.
{78:54} And brought them within the borders of his sanctuarie: euen to this mountayne which his right hand purchased.
{78:55} He dyd cast out the heathen also before them: he caused their land to be deuided among the for an heritage, & made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tentes.
{78:56} Neuerthelesse, they tempted and displeased the most hyghest Lorde: & kept not his testimonies.
{78:57} They turned backewarde, and they went astray like their forefathers: they started aside like a bowe that breaketh.
{78:58} For they stirred hym to anger with their hygh places: and prouoked him to ielousie with their carued images.
{78:59} When the Lorde hearde this, he was wroth: & toke sore displeasure at Israel.
{78:60} So that he forsoke the tabernacle in Silo: the pauilion wherin he dwelt amongst men.
{78:61} He deliuered his force into captiuitie: and his glorie into the enemies hande.
{78:62} He gaue also his people ouer to the sword: and was wroth with his inheritaunce.
{78:63} Fire consumed his young men: and his maydens were not maryed.
{78:64} His priestes were slayne with the sworde: and his wydowes made no lamentation.
{78:65} But the Lorde awaked as though he had slept: like a giaunt making a triumphant noyse after wine.
{78:66} He smote his enemies in the hynder parts: & put them to a perpetual shame.
{78:67} He refused the tabernacle of Ioseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim.
{78:68} But he chose the tribe of Iuda: euen the hill of Sion which he loued.
{78:69} And there he buylded his temple on high: and layde the foundation of it like a grounde euer to continue.
{78:70} He chose also Dauid his seruaunt: and toke hym away from the sheepefoldes.
{78:71} As he was folowing the ewes great with young he toke hym: that he might feede Iacob his people, and Israel his inheritaunce.
{78:72} So he fed them according to the simplicitie of his heart: and guided them by the discretion of his handes.
{79:1} A psalme of Asaph. O Lord, the heathen are come into thyne inheritaunce: they haue defiled thy holy temple, they haue made Hierusale an heape of stones
{79:2} They haue geuen the dead bodies of thy seruauntes to be meate vnto the foules of the ayre: and the fleshe of thy saintes vnto the beastes of the lande.
{79:3} They haue shed their blood like water on euery syde of Hierusalem: and there is none to burie them.
{79:4} We are become an open shame vnto our neyghbours: a very scorne and derision vnto them that are rounde about vs.
{79:5} O God, howe long wylt thou be angry? shall thy ielousie burne lyke fire for euer?
{79:6} Powre out thine indignation vpon the Heathen that haue not knowen thee: and vpon the kingdomes that haue not called vpon thy name.
{79:7} For they haue deuoured Iacob: and layde waste his dwelling place.
{79:8} O remember not against vs sinnes that be past, with all speede let thy tender mercy preuent vs: for we are brought very lowe.
{79:9} Helpe vs O Lord of our saluation for the glory of thy name: deliuer vs, and be mercyfull vnto our sinnes for thy names sake.
{79:10} Wherefore do the Heathen say, where is nowe their God? let the vengeaunce of thy seruauntes blood that is shed, be openly knowen amongst the Heathen in our sight.
{79:11} Let the sorowfull sighing of the prisoners come before thee, accordyng vnto the greatnes of thy power: preserue thou those that are appoynted to dye.
{79:12} And rewarde thou our neighbours seuen folde into their bosome: their blasphemie wherewith they haue blasphemed thee O God.
{79:13} So we who be thy people and sheepe of thy pasture wyll confesse thee for euer: and we wyll alway set foorth in wordes thy prayse, from generation to generation.
{80:1} To the chiefe musition, vpon Sosannim Eduth, a psalme of Asaph. Heare O thou shephearde of Israel, thou that leadest Ioseph lyke a sheepe: and thou that sittest vpon the Cherubims, shew thy gratious presence.
{80:2} Before Ephraim, Beniamin, and Manasses: stirre vp thy strength, and come for to saue vs.
{80:3} Turne vs agayne O Lorde: shewe the light of thy countenaunce, and we shalbe saued.
{80:4} O God, Lorde of hoastes: howe long wylt thou be angry at the prayer of thy people?
{80:5} Thou feedest them with the bread of teares: and geuest them plenteously teares to drinke.
{80:6} Thou hast made vs a strife vnto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh vs to scorne.
{80:7} Turne vs agayne thou Lorde of hoastes: shewe the light of thy countenaunce, and we shalbe saued.
{80:8} Thou dydst translate a vine out of Egypt: thou didst cast out the Heathen, and planted it.
{80:9} Thou madst roome before it: thou causedst it to take roote, and it hath filled the lande.
{80:10} The hilles were couered with her shadowe: and goodly high Cedar trees with her bowes.
{80:11} She stretched out her braunches vnto the sea: and her bowes vnto the riuer.
{80:12} Why hast thou then broken downe her hedge: that all they whiche go by plucke of her grapes?
{80:13} The wylde bore out of the wood rooteth it vp: and the wylde beast of the fielde deuoureth it.
{80:14} Turne thee agayne thou God of hoastes I pray thee: loke downe from heauen, beholde and visite this vine
{80:15} (80:14) and vineyarde that thy ryght hande hath planted, and the young braunche which thou hast fortified for thy selfe.
{80:16} (80:15) It is brent with fire and cut downe: they shall perishe at the rebuke of thy countenaunce.
{80:17} (80:16) Let thy hande be vpon the man of thy right hande: and vpon the sonne of man whom thou hast fortified for thyne owne selfe.
{80:18} (80:17) And so we wyll not go backe from thee: thou shalt reuiue vs, and we wyll call vpon thy name.
{80:19} (80:18) Turne vs agayne O God, Lorde of hoastes: shewe the light of thy countenaunce, and we shalbe saued.
{81:1} To the chiefe musition vpon Gittith, of Asaph. Sing we meryly vnto the Lorde our strength: make a chearefull noyse vnto the Lorde of Iacob.
{81:2} Take the psalterie: bryng hyther the tabret, the merie harpe, with the lute.
{81:3} Blowe vp the trumpet in the newe moone, euen in the time appointed: and vpon our solempne feast day.
{81:4} For this was made a statute for Israel: and a lawe of the God of Iacob.
{81:5} This he ordayned in Ioseph for a testimonie, when he came out of the lande of Egypt: where I hearde a tongue whiche I knewe not.
{81:6} I eased his shoulder from the burthen: and his handes ceassed from making pottes.
{81:7} Thou calledst vpon me in troubles, and I deliuered thee: I hearde thee out of the middest of a thunder, I proued thee also at the waters of strife. Selah.
{81:8} Then I sayd heare O my people: and I wyll geue thee a charge O Israel in protesting vnto thee.
{81:9} If thou wylt hearken vnto me, there shall be no straunge God in thee: neither shalt thou geue worship to any other Lorde beside me.
{81:10} I am God thy Lorde which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wyde, and I wyll fill it.
{81:11} But my people woulde not heare my voyce: and Israel would not obey me.
{81:12} So I gaue them vp vnto the wicked cogitations of their owne heartes: and I did let them folowe their owne imaginations.
{81:13} O that my people woulde haue hearkened vnto me: O that Israel had walked in my wayes.
{81:14} I should soone haue tamed their enemies: and turned myne hande against their aduersaries.
{81:15} The haters of God shoulde haue ben founde liers: and their time should haue endured for euer.
{81:16} He woulde haue fed them also with the finest wheate flowre: and I would haue satisfied thee with honie out of the stonie rocke.
{82:1} A psalme of Asaph. God standeth in the congregation of God: he iudgeth in the midst of God.
{82:2} Howe long wyll ye geue wrong iudgement: and accept the persons of the vngodly? Selah.
{82:3} Iudge ryght vnto the poore and fatherlesse: dispatch according to iustice suche as be afflicted and in necessitie.
{82:4} Deliuer the poore and outcast: saue them from the hande of the vngodly.
{82:5} They knowe nothyng, they vnderstande nothing: they walke on styll in darknesse, wherfore all the foundations of the earth be out of course.
{82:6} I haue sayde ye are gods: and ye all are chyldren of the most highest.
{82:7} But ye shall dye lyke as a man doth: and princes them selues shall fall away lyke as other do.
{82:8} Arise O God, and iudge thou the earth: for thou shalt take all Heathen to thine inheritaunce.
{83:1} A song, the psalme of Asaph. Holde not thy tongue O Lorde: kepe not styll scilence, refraine not thy selfe O Lorde.
{83:2} For beholde, thyne enemies make an vprore: and they that hate thee, haue lifted vp their head.
{83:3} They haue deuised shrewde counsell against thy people: and they haue consulted against thyne, whom thou defendest.
{83:4} They haue said, come, and let vs roote them out, that they be no more a people: and that the name of Israel may be no more in remembraunce.
{83:5} For they haue conspired all in one minde: & are confederate against thee.
{83:6} The pauilions of Edom and the Ismaelites: of Moab, and Hagerites,
{83:7} Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalec: the Philistines with the inhabitauntes of Tyre.
{83:8} Assur also is ioyned vnto them: they were a great ayde to the chyldren of Lot. Selah.
{83:9} But do thou vnto them, as vnto Midian: as vnto Sisera, as vnto Iabin at the brooke Kishon.
{83:10} Whiche perished at Ein Dor: and became as the doung of the earth.
{83:11} Make them, their princes, and al their captaynes: lyke Oreb, and lyke Zeeb, and lyke Salmunna.
{83:12} Whiche sayd, let vs take to our selues: the houses of God in possession.
{83:13} O my Lorde, make them lyke vnto a wheele: and as chaffe before the winde.
{83:14} Lyke as a fire that burneth vp the wood: and as the flambe that consumeth the mountaynes.
{83:15} Persecute them euen so with thy tempest: and make them afrayde with thy storme.
{83:16} Make shame to appeare in their faces: that they may seeke thy name O God.
{83:17} Let them be confounded and astonied with feare euer more & more: let them be put to shame, and perishe.
{83:18} And let them knowe that thou in thy name God eternall art only: O thou the most highest ouer all the earth.
{84:1} To the chiefe musition vpon Gittith, a psalme of the sonnes of Corach. O how amiable are thy dwellinges: thou God of hoastes?
{84:2} My soule hath a desire and a longing to enter into the courtes of God: my heart and my flesh leapeth with ioy for to go to the liuing Lorde.
{84:3} Yea the sparowe hath founde her an house, and the swallowe a nest: where she may lay her young: euen thy aulters O God of hoastes, my king & my Lord.
{84:4} Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they wyll be alway praysyng thee. Selah.
{84:5} Blessed is that man whose strength is in thee: thy wayes are in their heart.
{84:6} They iourneying through the vale of teares: (yea when euery cesterne at their name is filled with water) do accept it for a fayre pleasaunt well.
{84:7} They wyl set forward from a stoute courage to a stoute courage: that the God of Gods may be seene of them in Sion.
{84:8} O God Lorde of hoastes heare my prayer: geue eare O God of Iacob. Selah.
{84:9} Beholde O Lorde our shielde: and loke vpon the face of thyne annointed.
{84:10} For one day in thy courtes, is better then a thousande els where: I had rather be a doore keper in the house of my God, then to dwell in large tabernacles of vngodlynes.
{84:11} For God the Lorde is a sunne and a shielde: God geueth grace and worship, he withholdeth no good thyng from them that liue in any perfection.
{84:12} O God of hoastes: blessed is the man that putteth his trust in thee.
{85:1} To the chiefe musition, a psalme of the sonnes of Corach. O God, thou art become gracious vnto thy land: thou hast brought Iacob agayne home out of captiuitie.
{85:2} Thou hast forgeuen the wickednes of thy people: and couered all their sinnes. Selah.
{85:3} Thou hast taken away al thy displeasure: and turned thy selfe from thy wrathfull indignation.
{85:4} Turne vs O God of our saluation: and let thyne anger ceasse from vs.
{85:5} Wilt thou be displeased at vs for euer? and wylt thou stretche out thy wrath from one generation to another,
{85:6} Wylt thou not turne agayne and reuiue vs: that thy people may reioyce in thee?
{85:7} Shew vs thy louing kindnes O God: and graunt vs thy saluation.
{85:8} I wyll hearken what God the Lord saith: for he speaketh peace vnto his people & to his saintes, that they turne not agayne to folly.
{85:9} For truely his saluation is nye them that feare him: insomuch that glory dwelleth in our earth.
{85:10} Mercy and trueth are met together: righteousnes and peace haue kissed eche other.
{85:11} Trueth shall bud out of the earth: and ryghteousnes shall looke downe from heauen.
{85:12} Yea, God shall geue all that is good: and our earth shall geue her encrease.
{85:13} Euery man shall cause righteousnes to go before him: and he shall direct his steppes in the way.
{86:1} A prayer of Dauid. Bow downe thine eare O God, and heare me: for I am poore and in miserie.
{86:2} Preserue thou my soule, for I am holy: my God saue thy seruaunt that putteth his trust in thee.
{86:3} Be mercifull vnto me O God: for I do call dayly vpon thee.
{86:4} Comfort the soule of thy seruaunt: for vnto thee O Lord do I lift vp my soule.
{86:5} For thou Lorde art good and gracious: and of great mercy vnto all them that call vpon thee.
{86:6} Geue eare O God vnto my prayer: and be attentiue vnto the voyce of my humble petitions.
{86:7} I call vpon thee in the day of my trouble: for thou hearest me.
{86:8} Among the gods there is none like vnto thee O Lorde: there is not one that can do as thou doest.
{86:9} All nations whom thou hast made, shall come and worship thee O Lorde: and shall glorifie thy name.
{86:10} For thou art great and doest wonderous thinges: thou art God alone.
{86:11} Teache me thy way O God, and I wyll walke in thy trueth: make my heart all one with thyne, that it may feare thy name.
{86:12} I wyll acknowledge thee O Lorde my God with all my heart: and I wyl glorifie thy name for euer.
{86:13} For great is thy mercy towarde me: and thou hast deliuered my soule from the lowest part of hell.
{86:14} O God, the proude are rysen against me: a companie of outragious naughtipackes haue sought after my soule, and haue not set thee before their eyes.
{86:15} But thou O Lorde art a God full of compassion and mercy: long yet thou be angry, plenteous in goodnes and trueth.
{86:16} Turne thy face vnto me, and haue mercy vpon me: geue thy strength vnto thy seruaunt, and helpe the sonne of thine handmayde.
{86:17} Shewe some good token of thy fauour towardes me, that they whiche hate me may see it and be ashamed: because thou God hast helped me, and comforted me.
{87:1} A psalme, the song of the sonnes of Corach. God loueth the gates of Sion more then all the dwellynges of Iacob: for her foundations are vpon the holy hilles.
{87:2} (87:1) for her foundations are vpon the holy hilles.
{87:3} (87:2) Uery excellent thinges are spoken of thee: O thou citie of God. Selah.
{87:4} (87:3) I wyll make mention amongst those that knowe me, of Egypt and Babylon: behold also of Palestina and Tyre, with Ethiopia, and it shalbe sayde suche a man is borne there.
{87:5} (87:4) But of Sion it shalbe reported, that very many be borne in her: and the most highest him selfe shall establishe her.
{87:6} (87:5) God wyll number in the register of the people: euery one that is borne there. Selah.
{87:7} (87:6) And the singers aswell as the players of instrumentes: yea al my fountaines are in thee.
{88:1} A song, the psalme of the sonnes of Corach, to the chiefe musition vpon Mahalath Leannoth, a wise instruction of Heman the Ezrahite. O God the Lorde of my saluation, I crye day and night before thee:
{88:2} (88:1) let my prayer enter into thy presence, encline thyne eare vnto my crying.
{88:3} (88:2) For my soule is full of miserie: and my life toucheth the graue.
{88:4} (88:3) I am counted as one of them that go downe vnto the pit: and I am nowe become a man that hath no strength.
{88:5} (88:4) I am free among the dead: like such as beyng kylled lye in a graue, whom thou remembrest no more, and are cut away from thy hande.
{88:6} (88:5) Thou hast layde me in the lowest pit: in darknes and in deepenes.
{88:7} (88:6) Thyne indignation sore presseth me: and thou hast vexed me with all thy stormes. Selah.
{88:8} (88:7) Thou hast put away myne acquaintaunce farre from me, and made me to be abhorred of them: I am shut vp, I can not get foorth.
{88:9} (88:8) My sight fayleth through my affliction O God: I haue called dayly vpon thee, I haue stretched out mine handes vnto thee.
{88:10} (88:9) Wylt thou worke a miracle amongst the dead? or shal the dead rise vp againe and acknowledge thee? Selah.
{88:11} (88:10) Shall thy louing kindnes be talked of in the graue? or thy faythfulnes in destruction?
{88:12} (88:11) Shall thy wonderous workes be knowen in the darke? and thy righteousnes in the lande of forgetfulnes?
{88:13} (88:12) But vnto thee do I crye O God: and my prayer commeth early in the morning before thee.
{88:14} (88:13) O God, why abhorrest thou my soule: and why hidest thou thy face from me?
{88:15} (88:14) I am in miserie, I labour euen from my youth with the panges of death: I haue suffered thy terrours, and I am styll in doubt.
{88:16} (88:15) Thyne indignation hath gone ouer me: and thy terrours haue vndone me.
{88:17} (88:16) They came rounde about me dayly lyke water: and compassed me altogether on euery syde.
{88:18} (88:17) Thou hast put a way farre from me my frende and neighbour: thou hast hid mine acquaintaunce out of sight.
{89:1} A wyse instruction of Ethan the Ezrachite. I wyll sing alwayes of the mercy of God: with my mouth I wyll make knowen thy trueth from one generation to another.
{89:2} For I sayde, mercy shall for euer endure: thou hast established thy trueth in the heauens.
{89:3} I haue made a couenaunt with my chosen: I haue sworne vnto Dauid my seruaunt.
{89:4} I wyll establishe thy seede for euer: and buylde vp thy throne from generation to generation. Selah.
{89:5} O God, the very heauens shall confesse thy wonderous workes: and thy trueth in the congregation of saintes.
{89:6} For who is he in the cloudes that shal matche God: and who is like vnto God amongst the children gods?
{89:7} God is very terrible in the assemblie of saintes: and to be feared aboue al them that are about him.
{89:8} O God, Lorde of hoastes, who is like vnto thee a most mightie Lorde: and thy trueth is on euery side thee.
{89:9} Thou rulest the ragyng of the sea: when her waues aryse, thou delayest them.
{89:10} Thou hast brought Egypt in so bad a case as if it were wounded: thou hast scattered thyne enemies abrode with thy mightie arme.
{89:11} The heauens are thine, the earth also is thine: thou hast layde the foundation of the rounde worlde, and of all the plentie that is therin.
{89:12} Thou hast made the north and the south: Tabor and Hermon do reioyce in thy name.
{89:13} Thou hast a mightie arme: thy hand is strong, and thy right hand is exalted.
{89:14} Iustice and iudgement is the foundation of thy throne: mercy and trueth shall go before thy face.
{89:15} Blessed is the people that knoweth a triumphant noyse: O God, they shall walke in the light of thy countenaunce.
{89:16} They shall make them selues merie dayly in thy name: and in thy righteousnes they shall exalt them selues.
{89:17} For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy louing kindnes thou wylt lift vp our hornes.
{89:18} For our shielde is of God: and our king is of the most holy of Israel.
{89:19} Thou hast spoken somtimes in visions vnto thy saintes: and hast sayde, I haue added ayde vpon the mightie, I haue exalted one chose out of the people.
{89:20} I haue founde Dauid my seruaunt: I haue annoynted him with myne holye oyle.
{89:21} Therfore my hande shalbe assured vnto him: and mine arme shall strengthen hym.
{89:22} The enemie shal not be able to do him violence: the sonne of wickednesse shall not afflict hym.
{89:23} I wyll breake into peeces his foes before his face: and ouerthrowe them that hate hym.
{89:24} My trueth also and my mercy shalbe with hym: and in my name shall his horne be exalted.
{89:25} I wyll set also his dominion in the sea: and his right hande in the fluddes.
{89:26} He shall make inuocation vnto me: saying thou art my father O my God, and my fortresse of saluation.
{89:27} And I will make him my first borne: in higher state then kinges of the earth.
{89:28} My mercy wyll I kepe for hym euermore: and my couenaunt shal stand fast with hym.
{89:29} His seede also wyll I make to endure for euer: and his throne as the dayes of heauen.
{89:30} But if his chyldren forsake my lawe, and walke not in my iudgement:
{89:31} (89:30) if they breake my statutes, and kepe not my commaundementes,
{89:32} (89:31) I will then visite their transgressions with a rodde: and their wickednesse with stripes.
{89:33} (89:32) Neuerthelesse, my louyng kyndnesse I wyll not take vtterly from hym: I wyl not breake my promise with hym.
{89:34} (89:33) I wyll not violate my couenaunt: nor alter the thyng that is gone out of my lyppes.
{89:35} (89:34) I haue sworne once by my holynesse: that I wyll not speake an vntrueth vnto Dauid.
{89:36} (89:35) His seede shall endure for euer: and his throne shalbe as the sunne before me.
{89:37} (89:36) And as the moone which shall continue for euermore: and shalbe a faithful witnesse in heauen. Selah.
{89:38} (89:37) But thou hast abhorred & forsake thine annoynted: & art sore displeased at him.
{89:39} (89:38) Thou hast broken the couenaunt of thy seruaunt: thou hast disgraced his crowne, castyng it on the grounde.
{89:40} (89:39) Thou hast ouerthrowe all his walles: and broken downe his strong holdes.
{89:41} (89:40) All they that go by the way spoyle hym: he is become a rebuke vnto his neyghbours.
{89:42} (89:41) Thou hast exalted the ryght hande of his enemies: and made all his aduersaries to reioyce.
{89:43} (89:42) Thou hast turned the harde edge of his sworde: and thou hast not lifted him vp in the battayle.
{89:44} (89:43) Thou hast brought his noble estate to an ende: and hast cast his throne downe to the grounde.
{89:45} (89:44) Thou hast shortened the dayes of his youth: and thou hast couered him with shame. Selah.
{89:46} (89:45) O God howe long wylt thou hyde thy selfe? for euer? shall thy wrath burne lyke fire?
{89:47} (89:46) Remember what I am, howe short my tyme is of lyfe: wherfore hast thou created in vayne all the sonnes of men?
{89:48} (89:47) What man is he that lyueth and shall not see death? can he delyuer his owne soule from the hande of hell? Selah.
{89:49} (89:48) Lorde where are become thy former olde louyng kyndnesses: which thou dydst sweare vnto Dauid by thy fayth that thou wouldest perfourme.
{89:50} (89:49) Remember O Lorde the dishonour * of thy seruauntes: I beare in my bosome the dishonour of all people that be mightie.
{89:51} (89:50) Who beyng thine enemies O God do dishonour: who do dishonour the footsteppes of thine annoynted.
{89:52} (89:51) Blessed be God for euermore: so be it, and so be it.
{90:1} A prayer of Moyses the man of God. Lorde thou hast ben our habitation: from one generation to another generation.
{90:2} Before the moutaynes were brought foorth, or euer the earth & the worlde were made: thou art God both from euerlastyng, and also vntyll euerlastyng.
{90:3} Thou turnest man most miserable euen vnto dust: thou sayest also, O ye children of men returne you into dust.
{90:4} For a thousande yeres in thy syght are but as yestarday that is past: and as a watch in the nyght.
{90:5} Thou makest them to flowe away, they are a sleepe: they be in the morning as an hearbe that groweth.
{90:6} In the mornyng it florisheth and groweth vp: in the euenyng it is cut downe and wythered.
{90:7} For we be consumed through thy displeasure: and we are astonyed through thy wrathfull indignation.
{90:8} Thou hast set our misdeedes before thee: and our sinnes wherof we be not priuie, in the lyght of thy countenaunce.
{90:9} For all our dayes do passe in thine anger: we spende our yeres as in speaking a worde.
{90:10} The dayes of our yeres be in all threescore yeres and tenne, and yf through strength of nature men come to foure score yeres: yet is their iolitie but labour and care, yea moreouer it passeth in haste from vs, and we flee from it.
{90:11} Who regardeth the force of thy wrath? for euen there after as a man feareth thee, so feeleth he thy displeasure.
{90:12} Make vs to knowe so our dayes, that we number them: and we wyll frame a heart vnto wisdome.
{90:13} Turne agayne O God (what, for euer wylt thou be angry?) and be gratious vnto thy seruauntes.
{90:14} Replenishe vs early in the mornyng with thy mercie: and we wyll crye out for ioy, and be glad all the dayes of our lyfe.
{90:15} Make vs mery accordyng to the dayes that thou hast afflicted vs: and accordyng to the yeres wherin we haue suffred aduersitie.
{90:16} Let thy worke appeare in thy seruauntes: and thy glory in their children.
{90:17} And let the glorious maiestie of the Lorde our God be vpon vs: and prosper thou the worke of our handes vpon vs, O prosper thou our handy worke.
{91:1} Whosoeuer sitteth vnder the couer of the most highest: he shal abide vnder the shadowe of the almightie.
{91:2} I wyll say vnto God, thou art my hope and my fortresse: my Lorde, in whom I wyll trust.
{91:3} For he wyll delyuer thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the noysome pestilence.
{91:4} He wyll couer thee vnder his wynges, & thou shalt be safe vnder his fethers: his faythfulnesse shalbe thy shielde and buckler.
{91:5} Thou shalt not be afrayde of any terrour of the nyght: nor of any arrowe that sleeth by day,
{91:6} Nor of any pestilence that walketh in the darknesse: nor of any deadly fyt that destroyeth at hygh noone.
{91:7} A thousande shall fall beside thee, and ten thousande at thy ryght hande: but it shall not come nygh thee.
{91:8} Thou only with thine eyes shalt beholde: & see the rewarde of the vngodly.
{91:9} For thou O God art my hope: thou hast set thine habitation very hygh.
{91:10} There shall no euyll lyght on thee: neither shall any plague come nye thy dwellyng.
{91:11} For he wyll geue his angels charge ouer thee: to kepe thee in all thy wayes.
{91:12} They wyll beare thee in their handes: that thou hurt not thy foote agaynst a stone.
{91:13} Thou shalt set thy foote vppon the Lion and Adder: the young Lion and the Dragon thou shalt treade vnder thy feete.
{91:14} Because he hath set greatly his loue vpon me, therfore wyll I deliuer hym: I wyll set hym vp out of all daunger, because he hath knowen my name.
{91:15} He shall call vpon me, and I wyll heare hym: yea I am with hym in trouble, I wyll deliuer hym, and bryng hym to honour.
{91:16} I wyll satisfie hym with a long lyfe: and I wyll cause hym to see my saluation.
{92:1} A Psalme, the song for the sabbath day. It is a good thyng to confesse vnto God: and to syng psalmes vnto thy name O thou most hyghest.
{92:2} To set foorth in wordes thy louyng kyndnesse early in the mornyng: and thy trueth in the nyght season.
{92:3} Upon an instrument of ten strynges, and vpon the Lute: vpon the Harpe with a solemne sounde.
{92:4} For thou God hast made me glad thorowe thy workes: I do reioyce in the workes of thy handes.
{92:5} O God howe glorious are thy workes? thy thoughtes are very depe.
{92:6} An vnwise man doth not consider this: and a foole doth not vnderstande it.
{92:7} Wheras the vngodly do bud vp greene as the grasse, and wheras all workers of iniquitie do florishe: that they notwithstandyng shalbe destroyed for euer and euer.
{92:8} But thou O God: art the most highest for euermore.
{92:9} For lo, thine enemies O God, lo thine enemies shall perishe: & all the workers of wickednesse shalbe destroyed.
{92:10} But my horne shalbe exalted lyke the horne of an vnicorne: for I am annoynted with excellent oyle.
{92:11} And myne eye shall see those that lye in wayte for me: myne eare shall heare the malitious persons that rise vp agaynst me.
{92:12} The ryghteous shall florishe lyke a paulme tree: and shall spread abroade like a Cedar in Libanus.
{92:13} Such as be planted in the house of God: shall florishe in the courtes of our Lorde.
{92:14} They shall styll bryng foorth fruite in their age: they shalbe fat and florishyng.
{92:15} For to set foorth in wordes that God is vpright: he is my rocke, and no iniquitie is in hym.
{93:1} God raigneth, he is clothed with a glorious maiestie, God is clothed with strength: he hath girded hym selfe, he hath made the worlde so sure that it can not be moued.
{93:2} Euer since the worlde began, thy throne hath ben set sure: thou art from euerlastyng.
{93:3} The fluddes are risen O God, the fluddes haue lyft vp their noyse: the fluddes haue lyft vp their waues.
{93:4} God which is on high, is more puissaut then the noyse of many waters: then the mightie waues of the sea.
{93:5} Thy testimonies are most certayne: holynesse is an ornament to thine house O God in all tymes.
{94:1} O God the Lord of all auengeaunce: the Lorde of all auengeaunce shewe thy glorious maiestie.
{94:2} Be exalted O thou iudge of the world: and rewarde the proude after their deseruyng.
{94:3} O God howe long shall the vngodly: howe long shall the vngodly triumph?
{94:4} All such as be workers of iniquitie: they babble, they prate shoutly, they make boastes of them selues.
{94:5} They oppresse thy people O God: and they afflict thine heritage.
{94:6} They murther the wyddowe and the straunger: & put the fatherlesse to death.
{94:7} And they say, tushe the Lorde seeth it not: neither doth the God of Iacob vnderstande it.
{94:8} Understande ye vnwyse among the people: O ye fooles, when wyll ye be well aduised?
{94:9} He that hath planted the eare, shall he not heare? yf he shapeth the eye, shall he not see?
{94:10} He that chasteneth the heathen, shall not he punishe? it is he that teacheth man knowledge.
{94:11} God knoweth the thoughtes of man: that they are but vanitie.
{94:12} Blessed is the man O Lorde, whom thou wylt chasten: and whom thou wylt instruct in thy lawe.
{94:13} That thou mayest geue hym patience in tyme of aduersitie: vntyll the pyt be digged vp for the vngodly.
{94:14} For God wyll not reiect his people: neither wil he forsake his inheritaunce.
{94:15} For iudgement shalbe reduced vnto iustice: and after it shall all such as be vpryght of heart be iudged.
{94:16} Who will ryse vp with me agaynst the malicious? or who wyll take my part agaynst workers of wickednesse?
{94:17} If God had not ben an ayde vnto me: it had not fayled much but my soule had dwelled in silence.
{94:18} But when I sayde my foote hath slypped: thy mercy O God helde me vp.
{94:19} In the multitude of my cogitations from the bottome of my heart: thy comfortes dyd recreate my soule.
{94:20} Shall the seate of wickednesse haue any thyng to do with thee: which seate maketh wrong to be enacted for a law?
{94:21} They flocke together agaynst the soule of the ryghteous: and condemne the innocent blood.
{94:22} But God is to me a refuge: and my Lorde is the rocke of my confidence.
{94:23} And he wyll recompence them their wickednesse, and destroy them in their owne malice: God our Lorde wyll destroy them.
{95:1} Come let vs syng vnto God: let vs make an heartie reioysyng with a loude voyce vnto the rocke of our saluation.
{95:2} Let vs make speede to come before his face with a confession: let vs expresse vnto hym outwardly a heartie gladnesse with syngyng of psalmes.
{95:3} For God is a great Lorde: and a great kyng aboue all gods.
{95:4} In his hande are all the deepe corners of the earth: and the hygh toppes of hylles be his also.
{95:5} The sea is his, and he made it: and his handes fashioned the drye lande.
{95:6} Come, let vs worshyp and fall downe: let vs kneele before the face of God our maker.
{95:7} For he is our Lorde: and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheepe of his hande.
{95:8} To day yf ye wyll heare his voyce harden not your heartes as in the tyme of contention: as in the day of temptation in the wildernesse.
{95:9} When your fathers tempted me, proued me: yea after they had seene my worke.
{95:10} Fourtie yeres long was I greeued with that generation: and I sayde this people erreth in heart, and they haue not knowen my wayes.
{95:11} Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they shoulde not enter at all into my rest.
{96:1} Syng you vnto God a newe song: sing ye vnto God all that be in the earth.
{96:2} Syng ye vnto God and blesse his name: set foorth in wordes from day to day his saluation.
{96:3} Declare his glory amongst the heathen: and his wonderous actes amongst all the people.
{96:4} For God is great and worthy of all prayse: he is more to be feared then all gods.
{96:5} As for all the gods of the heathen they be but idoles: and it is God that made the heauens.
{96:6} Honour and maiestie be before hym: power and excellentnesse be in his sanctuarie.
{96:7} Geue vnto God O ye families of the people: geue vnto God glorie & power.
{96:8} Geue vnto God glorie due vnto his name: bryng an offeryng, and come into his courtes.
{96:9} Worshyp you God in the maiestie of holynesse: be you in dread of his face all that be in the earth.
{96:10} Set it foorth in wordes among the heathen that God raigneth: and that the worlde is set of a sure foundation, it shall not be remoued, he wyll iudge the people accordyng to equitie.
{96:11} The heauens shall reioyce, and the earth be glad: the sea shall make a noyse and all that is therin.
{96:12} The fielde shalbe ioyfull and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood reioyce before the face of God.
{96:13} For he commeth, for he commeth to iudge the earth: he will iudge the world accordyng to iustice, and the people accordyng to his trueth.
{97:1} God raigneth, the earth shalbe glad: the multitude of the Iles shalbe glad therof.
{97:2} Cloudes and thicke darknesse are rounde about hym: iustice and iudgement are the habitation of his throne.
{97:3} There goeth a fire before his face: and burneth his enemies on euery syde.
{97:4} His lightninges gaue a lyght vnto the worlde: the earth sawe it and trembled.
{97:5} The hylles melted lyke waxe at the presence of God: at the presence of the Lorde of the whole earth.
{97:6} The heauens haue declared his iustice: and all the people haue seene his glorie.
{97:7} Confounded be all they that do seruice vnto carued images: and that do glorie in idols, but O gods, you all shall worshyp hym.
{97:8} Sion hearde of it, and reioyced: and the daughters of Iuda be glad, because of thy iudgementes O God.
{97:9} For thou art a God hygher then all that are in the earth: thou art exalted farre aboue all gods.
{97:10} You that loue God, hate the thyng which is euyll: he preserueth the soules of his saintes, he wyll delyuer them from the hande of the vngodly.
{97:11} There is sowen a lyght for the ryghteous: and gladnesse for such as be vpryght of heart.
{97:12} Reioyce in God O ye ryghteous: and prayse hym at the remembraunce of his holynesse.
{98:1} A psalme. Syng vnto God a newe song: for he hath done marueylous thynges. (98:2) With his owne right hande and with his holy arme: he hath gotten to hym selfe the victorie.
{98:2} (98:3) God hath declared his saluation: he hath openly shewed his iustice in the syght of the heathen.
{98:3} (98:4) He hath remembred his mercie and trueth towarde the house of Israel: and all the endes of the worlde haue seene the saluation of our Lorde.
{98:4} (98:5) Shewe your selues ioyfull vnto God all ye in the earth: make a ioly noyse, reioyce you chearfully, & syng psalmes.
{98:5} (98:6) Syng psalmes vnto God playing vpon an harpe: vpon an harpe, and with the sounde of a psalterie.
{98:6} (98:7) Shewe your selues ioyfull before the kyng eternall: with trumpettes and sounde of shawmes.
{98:7} (98:8) Let the sea make a noyse, and that is within it: the rounde worlde, and they that dwell therin.
{98:8} (98:9) Let the fluddes clappe their handes: and let the hylles be ioyfull altogether before the face of God.
{98:9} (98:10) For he commeth to iudge the earth: he wyll iudge the worlde accordyng to iustice, & the people accordyng to equitie.
{99:1} God raigneth, the people be in a rage: he sitteth betweene the Cherubims, the earth quaketh.
{99:2} God is great in Sion: and high aboue all people.
{99:3} They shall prayse thy name great & dreadfull: for it is holy, and a kynges power that loueth iudgement.
{99:4} Thou hast ordeyned all thynges accordyng to equitie: thou hast caused iudgement and iustice to be in Iacob.
{99:5} Magnifie God our Lorde: and kneele downe before his footstoole, for it is holy.
{99:6} Moyses & Aaron among his priestes, and Samuel among such as call vpon his name: these called vpon God, and he hearde them.
{99:7} He spake vnto them out of the cloudy pyller: for they kept his testimonies, and the lawe that he gaue them.
{99:8} O God our Lord thou heardest them, O Lorde thou didst forbeare them: and thou tokest auengement for their owne inuentions.
{99:9} Magnifie God our Lorde, and kneele downe before his holy hyll: for God our Lorde is holy.
{100:1} A psalme for to confesse. Be ye ioyfull in God all that be in the earth:
{100:2} (100:1) serue God with gladnesse, and come before his face with a ioyfull noyse.
{100:3} (100:2) Be ye sure that God is the Lorde, it is he that hath made vs, and not we our selues: we are his people and the sheepe of his pasture.
{100:4} (100:3) Go your way into his gates with thankesgeuyng, and into his courtes with prayse: be thankfull vnto hym and blesse his name.
{100:5} (100:4) For God is gratious, his mercie is euerlastyng: and his trueth endureth from generation to generation.
{101:1} A psalme of Dauid. I will sing of mercie and iudgement: I wyll syng vnto thee O God psalmes.
{101:2} I wyll endeuour my selfe to be fully instructed in the way of perfectnesse: when thou wylt come vnto me, I wil go vp and downe in the middest of my house in the perfectnesse of my heart.
{101:3} I wyll neuer set before myne eyes any deuillishe thyng: I wyll detest to do the worke of transgressours, it shall take no holde of me.
{101:4} A frowarde heart shall depart from me: I wyll not once knowe any euyll.
{101:5} I will destroy him who priuily slaundereth his neighbour: I wyll not suffer hym who hath a proude loke and a great stomacke.
{101:6} Myne eyes shalbe vpon such in the lande as haue a true meanyng, that they may sit with me: he that leadeth a perfect lyfe shall minister vnto me.
{101:7} There shall no deceiptfull person haue any seate in my house: he that telleth lyes shall not tary long in my syght.
{101:8} I wyll euery mornyng destroy all the vngodly in the lande: that I may roote out from the citie of God all workers of wickednesse.
{102:1} A prayer of the afflicted when he was ouerwhelmed, and when he did powre out his petition before the face of God. Heare my prayer O God: and let my crying come in vnto thee.
{102:2} Hyde not thy face from me in the day of my distresse: encline thine eare vnto me, heare me spedyly in the day that I call.
{102:3} For my dayes are consumed away like smoke: and my bones are burnt vp as though they were a firebrande.
{102:4} My heart is smitten downe and wythered lyke grasse: because I did forget to eate my bread.
{102:5} Through the noyse of my gronyng: my bones wyll scase cleaue to my fleshe.
{102:6} I am become lyke a Pellicane of the wildernesse, and like an Owle that is in the desert:
{102:7} (102:6) I watch, and am as it were a sparrowe that sitteth alone vpon the house toppe.
{102:8} (102:7) Myne enemies reuile me all the day long: and they that are in a rage against me, make their oth by me.
{102:9} (102:8) For I haue eaten asshes as it were bread, and mingled my drynke with weepyng,
{102:10} (102:8) because of thine indignation and wrath: for thou hast set me vp, and cast me downe.
{102:11} (102:9) My dayes fade away lyke a shadowe: and I am wythered lyke grasse.
{102:12} (102:10) But thou O God endurest for euer: and thy remembraunce throughout all generations.
{102:13} (102:11) Thou wylt aryse vp, thou wylt haue compassion vpon Sion: for it is tyme that thou haue mercie vpon her, for the tyme appoynted is come.
{102:14} (102:12) For thy seruauntes be well affected towarde her stones: and it pitieth them to see her in the dust.
{102:15} (102:13) And the heathen wyll feare thy name O God: and all the kynges of the earth thy glorious maiestie.
{102:16} (102:14) For God wyll buylde vp Sion: to be seene in his glorious maiestie.
{102:17} (102:15) He wyll regarde the prayer of the humble destitute of all helpe: and he wyll not dispise their prayer.
{102:18} (102:16) This shalbe written for those that come after: and the people which shalbe borne, shall prayse the Lorde.
{102:19} (102:17) For he hath loked downe from his high sanctuarie: out of heauen did God beholde the earth.
{102:20} (102:18) That he might heare the mourninges of such as be in captiuitie: and delyuer the children of death.
{102:21} (102:19) That they may declare the name of God in Sion: and his prayse at Hierusalem.
{102:22} (102:20) When people were gathered together, & kyngdomes to serue God:
{102:23} (102:20) he afflicted my strength in the way, he shortened my dayes.
{102:24} (102:21) But I say, O my God take me not away in the middest of myne age: as for thy yeres, they endure throughout all generations.
{102:25} (102:22) Thou hast before tyme layde the foundation of the earth: and the heauens are the worke of thy handes.
{102:26} (102:23) They shall perishe, but thou wylt remayne styll: they all shall waxe olde as doth a garment, and as a vesture thou wylt chaunge them, and they shalbe chaunged.
{102:27} (102:24) But thou art, and thy yeres can not fayle:
{102:28} (102:24) the children of thy seruauntes shal dwell, and their seede shalbe maynteyned in thy syght.
{103:1} Blesse God O my soule: and all that is within me prayse his holy name.
{103:2} Blesse God O my soule: and forget not all his benefites.
{103:3} Who forgeueth all thy wickednesse: and healeth all thine infirmities.
{103:4} Who redeemeth thy lyfe from destruction: and crowneth thee with mercie and louyng kyndnesse.
{103:5} Who satisfieth thy mouth with good thynges: causyng thy youth lyke an Egles to be renued.
{103:6} God executeth iustice and iudgement: for all them that are oppressed with wrong.
{103:7} He made his wayes knowen vnto Moyses: his workes vnto the children of Israel.
{103:8} God is full of compassion and pitie: loth to be angry, and exceedyng great in mercie.
{103:9} He vseth not to continue in chydyng: neither reserueth he his anger for euer.
{103:10} He dealeth not with vs accordyng to our sinnes: nor rewardeth vs according to our wickednesse.
{103:11} For accordyng to the hyghnesse of heauen aboue the earth: his mercie preuayleth to them that feare hym.
{103:12} Loke howe farre distaunt the east is from the west: so farre a sunder setteth he our sinnes from vs.
{103:13} Yea lyke as a father pitieth his owne children: euen so is God mercifull vnto them that feare hym.
{103:14} For he knoweth wherof we be made: he remembreth that we are but dust.
{103:15} The dayes of man are as the dayes of an hearbe: he florisheth as a flowre in the fielde.
{103:16} For the winde passeth ouer it, and it is no more seene: and the place therof knoweth it no more.
{103:17} But the mercifull goodnesse of God endureth for euer and euer, vpon them that feare hym: and his righteousnesse vpon childers children.
{103:18} Euen vpon such as kepe his couenaunt: and thinke vpon his commaundementes to do them.
{103:19} God hath prepared his seate in heauen: and his kyngdome ruleth ouer all.
{103:20} Blesse God O ye his angels mightie in operation: who fulfyll his worde in hearkening vnto the voyce of his word.
{103:21} Blesse God all ye his hoastes: you his ministers that do his pleasure.
{103:22} Blesse God all you his workes in all places of his dominion: O my soule blesse thou God.
{104:1} My soule blesse thou God: O God my Lord thou art become exceeding great, thou hast put on glory and maiestie.
{104:2} Who is decked with light as it were with a garment: spreadyng out the heauens like a curtayne.
{104:3} Who seeleth his vpper chaumbers with waters: and maketh the cloudes his charriot, and walketh vpon the wynges of the wynde.
{104:4} He maketh his angels spirites: and his ministers a flaming fire.
{104:5} He hath layde the earth sure vpon her foundations: that it can neuer moue at any tyme.
{104:6} Thou coueredst it with the deepe, lyke as with a garment: the waters stande vpon the hilles.
{104:7} At thy rebuke they flee: at the noyse of thy thunder they bluster downe apace.
{104:8} The hilles mount aloft: and the valleys settle downe beneath vnto the place where thou hast layde a foundation for them.
{104:9} Thou hast set them their boundes which they shall not passe: neither shall they returne agayne to couer the earth.
{104:10} Who also causeth the springes which runne betweene the hilles: to flowe into the riuers.
{104:11} All beastes of the fielde drinke therof: and the wylde asses quench their thirst.
{104:12} The foules of the ayre haue their habitation nigh vnto them: singing out of the midst of the bowes of trees.
{104:13} He watereth the hilles from aboue: the earth is replenished with the fruite of thy workes.
{104:14} He causeth grasse to growe for cattell: and hearbes for the vse of man.
{104:15} That he may bryng foorth foode out of the earth: both wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oyle to make hym haue a chearefull countenaunce, & also bread to strengthen mans heart.
{104:16} The trees of God be satisfied: euen the Cedars of Libanus which he hath planted.
{104:17} Wherin the birdes make their nestes: in the fyrre trees the storke buyldeth.
{104:18} The high hilles are a refuge for goates: and so are the stonie rockes for conies.
{104:19} He hath made the moone for certayne seasons: and the sunne knoweth his goyng downe.
{104:20} Thou makest darknes and it is night: wherein all the beastes of the forrest do go abrode.
{104:21} The Lions do roare after a pray: and in seeking their meate of God.
{104:22} When the sunne ariseth, they recoyle backe: and lay them downe to rest in their dennes.
{104:23} Man goeth foorth to his worke: and to do his seruice vntyll the euening.
{104:24} O God howe manyfolde are thy workes? thou hast made them al in wisdome, the earth is ful of thy ryches.
{104:25} So is the sea it selfe large and wyde in compasse: wherein are thinges creeping innumerable, both small and great beastes.
{104:26} There go the shippes, and there is that Leuiathan: whom thou hast made to take his pastime therin.
{104:27} These wayte all vpon thee: that thou mayest geue them meate in due season.
{104:28} When thou geuest it them, they gather it: and when thou openest thyne hand, they are filled with that which is good.
{104:29} When thou hydest thy face, they are troubled: when thou takest away their spirite, they dye, and are turned agayne to their dust.
{104:30} When thou sendest out thy spirite, they be recreated: and thou reuiuest the face of the earth.
{104:31} The glorious maiestie of God shal endure for euer: God wyll reioyce in his workes.
{104:32} He beholdeth the earth, & it trembleth: he toucheth the hilles, and they smoke.
{104:33} I wyll syng vnto God as long as I liue: I will sing psalmes vnto my Lord so long as I shall be.
{104:34} My meditations of hym shalbe very pleasaunt: for all my ioy shalbe in God.
{104:35} As for sinners they shalbe consumed out of the earth: and the vngodly shall come to an ende, blesse thou God O my soule, and prayse you the Lorde.
{105:1} Confesse you it vnto God, call vppon his name: cause the people to vnderstande his deuises.
{105:2} Sing vnto hym, sing psalmes vnto him: talke you of all his wonderous workes.
{105:3} Glary ye in his holy name: let the heart of them reioyce that do seeke God.
{105:4} Seeke God and his strength: seeke his face euermore.
{105:5} Remember the meruaylous workes that he hath done: his wonders, and the iudgementes of his mouth.
{105:6} O ye seede of Abraham his seruaunt, ye his chosen chyldren of Iacob:
{105:7} (105:6) he is God our Lord, his iudgementes are in all the earth.
{105:8} (105:7) He hath ben mindfull alwayes of his couenaunt (for he promised a worde to a thousande generations:)
{105:9} (105:7) euen of his couenaunt that he made with Abraham, and of his othe vnto Isaac.
{105:10} (105:8) And he appointed the same vnto Iacob for a law: and to Israel for an euerlasting couenaunt.
{105:11} (105:9) Saying, vnto thee I wyll geue the lande of Chanaan: the lot of your inheritaunce.
{105:12} (105:10) When they were a fewe men in number, and had ben straungers but a litle whyle in it:
{105:13} (105:10) and when they went from one nation to another, from one kingdome to another people.
{105:14} (105:11) He suffred no man to do them wrong: yea he reproued euen kynges for their sakes.
{105:15} (105:12) Touche not mine annoynted: and triumph not ouer my prophetes.
{105:16} (105:13) Moreouer he called for a famine vpon the lande: and he made all maner of foode to fayle.
{105:17} (105:14) But he had sent a man before them: euen Ioseph, who was solde to be a bonde seruaunt.
{105:18} (105:15) Whose feete they dyd hurt in the stockes: the iron entred into his soule.
{105:19} (105:16) Vntill the tyme came that his cause was knowen: the worde of the Lorde tryed hym.
{105:20} (105:17) The king sent and caused hym to be let go: yea the prince of the people opened a way foorth for hym.
{105:21} (105:18) He made him Lorde of his house: and ruler of all his substaunce.
{105:22} (105:19) That he might enfourme his princes according to his minde: and teache his senatours wysdome.
{105:23} (105:20) Israel also came into Egypt: & Iacob was a straunger in the lande of Cham.
{105:24} (105:21) And he encreased his people exceedinglye: and made them stronger then their enemies.
{105:25} (105:22) Whose heart so turned that they hated his people: and dealt subtilly with his seruauntes.
{105:26} (105:23) Then he sent Moyses his seruaunt, and Aaron whom he had chosen:
{105:27} (105:23) they did their message, workyng his signes among them, and wonders in the lande of Cham.
{105:28} (105:24) He sent darknes, & it was darke: and they went not from his wordes.
{105:29} (105:25) He turned their waters into blood: and slue their fishe.
{105:30} (105:26) Their lande brought foorth frogges: yea euen in their kinges chaumbers.
{105:31} (105:27) He spake the worde, and there came a swarme of all maner of flyes: and of lyce in all their quarters.
{105:32} (105:28) He gaue them haylestones for rayne: and flambes of fire in their lande.
{105:33} (105:29) He smote their vines also & figge trees: and he destroyed the trees that were in their coastes.
{105:34} (105:30) He spake the worde, and the grashoppers came: & caterpillers innumerable.
{105:35} (105:31) And they did eate vp all the grasse in their lande: and deuoured the fruite of their grounde.
{105:36} (105:32) He smote al the first borne in their land: euen the first fruites of all their concupiscence.
{105:37} (105:33) He also brought them foorth with siluer and golde: there was not one feeble person in their tribes.
{105:38} (105:34) Egypt was glad at their departing: for they were smytten with dread of them.
{105:39} (105:35) He spred out a cloude to be a couering: and fire to geue light in the night season.
{105:40} (105:36) The people required and he brought quayles: and he filled them with the bread of heauen.
{105:41} (105:37) He opened the rocke of stone and the waters flowed out: so that streames ranne in drye places.
{105:42} (105:38) For he remembred his holy worde: spoken vnto Abraham his seruaunt.
{105:43} (105:39) And he brought foorth his people with gladnes: and his chosen with a ioyfull noyse.
{105:44} (105:40) And he gaue them the landes of the Heathen, and they toke to inheritaunce the labours of the people.
{105:45} (105:41) To the intent that they shoulde kepe his statutes: and obserue his lawes. Prayse ye the Lorde.
{106:1} Prayse ye the Lorde. Confesse you it vnto god, for he is gratious: and his mercy endureth for euer.
{106:2} Who can expresse the valiaunt actes of God: who can publishe abrode all his prayse?
{106:3} Blessed are they that kepe iudgement: and do iustice at all times.
{106:4} Remember me O God according to the fauour that thou bearest vnto thy people: O visite me with thy saluation.
{106:5} That I may see the felicitie of thy chosen, that I may reioyce at the gladnes of thy people: and that I may glorie with thyne inheritaunce.
{106:6} We haue sinned with our fathers: we haue done amisse and dealt wickedly.
{106:7} Our fathers did not well consider thy wonders in Egypt, neither did they remember thy manifolde great goodnes: but they rebelled at the sea, euen at the red sea.
{106:8} Neuerthelesse, he saued them for his names sake: that he myght make his power to be knowen.
{106:9} And he rebuked the red sea, and it was dryed vp: so he led them through the deepe, as through a wyldernesse.
{106:10} And he saued them from the hande of suche as hated them: & redeemed them from the hande of the enemie.
{106:11} As for their aduersaries the waters ouerwhelmed them: there was not one of them left remayning.
{106:12} Then beleued they his wordes: and song prayse vnto him.
{106:13} But within a very short whyle they forgat his workes: they woulde not wayte for his counsell.
{106:14} And they were taken with a great lust in the wyldernesse: and they tempted God in the desert.
{106:15} And he gaue them their desire: and sent leannes withal into their soule.
{106:16} They enuied also at Moyses in the tentes: and at Aaron the saint of God.
{106:17} So the earth opened and swalowed vp Dathan: and couered the company of Abiram.
{106:18} And the fire was kindled in their company: the flambe brent vp the vngodly.
{106:19} They made a calfe in Horeb: and worshipped the moulten image.
{106:20} Thus they turned their glory: into the similitude of a calfe that eateth hay.
{106:21} They forgat God their sauiour, who had done so great thynges in Egypt:
{106:22} (106:21) wonderous workes in ye land of Cham, and terrible thinges at the red sea.
{106:23} (106:22) Wherfore he appointed to destroy them, had not Moyses his chosen stand in the breache before hym: to turne away his wrathful indignation, lest he should destroy them.
{106:24} (106:23) Yea they thought scorne of the lande most to be desired: they gaue no credite vnto his worde.
{106:25} (106:24) But they murmured in their tentes: they would not hearken vnto the voyce of God.
{106:26} (106:25) Then lift he vp his hand against them, to geue them an ouerthrowe in the wildernesse:
{106:27} (106:25) to geue their seede an ouerthrowe amongst the nations, and to scatter them in sundry landes.
{106:28} (106:26) They ioyned them selues vnto Baal Peor: they also did eate of the sacrifices of the dead.
{106:29} (106:27) And they prouoked the Lorde vnto anger with their owne inuentions: and a plague fell mightily amongst them.
{106:30} (106:28) Then stoode vp Phinehes, he executed iustice: and so the plague ceassed.
{106:31} (106:29) And that was imputed vnto hym for righteousnesse: in generation and generation for euermore.
{106:32} (106:30) They also prouoked God at the waters of strife: and all was not well with Moyses for their sakes.
{106:33} (106:31) For they had caused an alteration to be of his spirite: so that he spake vnaduisedly with his lippes.
{106:34} (106:32) Moreouer, they destroyed not the Heathen: as God commaunded them.
{106:35} (106:33) But they were mingled amongst the Heathen: and learned their workes.
{106:36} (106:34) Insomuch that they dyd seruice vnto their idols: whiche were to the a snare.
{106:37} (106:35) Yea they sacrifised their sonnes: and their daughters vnto deuils.
{106:38} (106:36) And they shed innocent blood, euen the blood of their sonnes and of their daughters: whom they sacrifised vnto the idols of Chanaan, and the lande was defiled with blood.
{106:39} (106:37) Thus were they stayned with their owne workes: and went a whoryng with their owne inuentions.
{106:40} (106:38) Therfore was the wrath of God kindeled against his people: insomuch that he abhorred his owne inheritaunce.
{106:41} (106:39) And he gaue them ouer into the hand of the Heathen: and they that dyd hate them, were lordes ouer them.
{106:42} (106:40) Their enemies oppressed them: and brought them into subiection vnder their hande.
{106:43} (106:41) Many a time dyd God deliuer them, but they rebelled against hym with their owne inuentions: and were brought downe for their wickednes.
{106:44} (106:42) Neuerthelesse, he did beholde them in their aduersitie: in geuing eare to their complaint.
{106:45} (106:43) And he remembred his couenaunt: and repented, according to the multitude of his mercies.
{106:46} (106:44) Yea he made all those that led them away captiue: to pitie them.
{106:47} (106:45) Saue vs O God our Lorde, and gather vs from among the Heathen: that we may geue thankes to thy holy name, and glory of thy prayse.
{106:48} (106:46) Blessed be God the Lord of Israel from world to world without end: and let all people say, so be it. Prayse ye the Lord.
{107:1} Confesse you it vnto God: for he is gratious, and his mercy endureth for euer.
{107:2} Let such as God did redeme speake: whom he hath redeemed from the hande of the enemie.
{107:3} And whom he gathered out of the landes: from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.
{107:4} They went astray out of the way in solitarines and in wildernes, and found no citie to dwell in:
{107:5} (107:4) they were hungry and thirstie, their soule fainted in them.
{107:6} (107:5) And they cry vnto god in their trouble: who deliuereth them from their distresse.
{107:7} (107:6) And he leadeth them foorth by the right way: that they might go to the citie inhabited.
{107:8} (107:7) O that men would confesse vnto God his louyng kindnesse: and his marueylous actes done to the chyldren of men.
{107:9} (107:8) For he satisfieth the greedie soule: and filleth the hungry soule with goodnes.
{107:10} (107:9) Suche as sit in darknesse and in the shadowe of death: beyng fast bounde in miserie and iron.
{107:11} (107:10) Because they went from the wordes of the Lorde: and lightly regarded the counsayle of the most highest.
{107:12} (107:11) Therfore he humbled their heart thorowe heauines: they fall downe, and there is none to helpe them.
{107:13} (107:12) And they cry vnto god in their trouble: who deliuereth the out of their distresse.
{107:14} (107:13) For he bringeth them out of darknesse and out of the shadowe of death: and breaketh their bondes in sunder.
{107:15} (107:14) O that men would confesse vnto God: his louing kindnes and his marueylous actes done to the chyldren of men.
{107:16} (107:15) For he breaketh the gates of brasse: & smyteth the barres of iron in sunder.
{107:17} (107:16) Foolish men are plagued for their mischeuous wayes: & for their wickednes.
{107:18} (107:17) Their soule abhorreth all maner of meate: and they be euen harde at deathes doore.
{107:19} (107:18) And they crye vnto God in their trouble: who deliuereth them out of their distresse.
{107:20} (107:19) he sendeth his worde & healeth them: and he maketh them to scape safe from their corruptnes.
{107:21} (107:20) O that men would confesse vnto God: his louing kindnes and his marueylous actes done to the chyldren of men.
{107:22} (107:21) And that they would offer vnto him sacrifices of thankes geuing: and set foorth in wordes his workes with a ioyfull noyse.
{107:23} (107:22) Such as go downe to the sea in ships and folowe their busines in great waters:
{107:24} (107:22) they see the workes of God, and his wonders in the deepe.
{107:25} (107:23) For he commaundeth and causeth a stormie winde to arise: and he lifteth vp on high his waues.
{107:26} (107:24) Then they ascende vp to heauen, and come downe agayne to the deepe: so that their soule melteth away through trouble.
{107:27} (107:25) They reele to and fro, and they do stacker like a drunken man: and their wysdome fayleth them.
{107:28} (107:26) And they cry vnto god in their trouble: who deliuereth the out of their distresse.
{107:29} (107:27) For he maketh the storme to ceasse: so that the waues therof are still.
{107:30} (107:28) Then be they glad because they are at rest: and he bringeth them to the hauen where they woulde be.
{107:31} (107:29) O that men would confesse vnto god: his louyng kyndnes and meruaylous actes done to the chyldren of men.
{107:32} (107:30) And that they would exalt him in the congregation of the people: and prayse him in the consistorie of the aged.
{107:33} (107:31) He turneth fluddes into a wildernes: and waterspringes into a drye grounde.
{107:34} (107:32) He maketh a fruitfull grounde barren: for the wickednes of them that dwell therein.
{107:35} (107:33) Contrary he reduceth a wyldernes into a standing water: and a drye ground into water springes.
{107:36} (107:34) And he setteth there the hungry: and they buylde them a citie to dwell in.
{107:37} (107:35) And they sowe their lande and plant vineyardes: and they yelde vnto them aboundant store of fruites.
{107:38} (107:36) He blesseth them, so that they multiplie exceedingly: and he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
{107:39} (107:37) But when they do fall from God, they are diminished & brought low: through oppression, calamitie, & griefe of minde.
{107:40} (107:38) He bringeth princes into contempt: & he maketh them to wander in a wildernesse where there is no way at all.
{107:41} (107:39) Yet he exalteth the poore out of miserie: and geueth him housholdes equall to flockes of cattell.
{107:42} (107:40) The righteous will marke this and reioyce: and the mouth of all wickednesse shalbe stopped.
{107:43} (107:41) Whosoeuer is wyse, he wyll both obserue these thinges: and also well consider the louing kindnesse of God.
{108:1} A song, the psalme of Dauid. My heart is redye O Lorde: I wyll sing & prayse thee in singing of psalmes, yea my glory also is redie.
{108:2} Bestirre thee O lute and harpe: I my selfe wil bestirre me right early in the morning.
{108:3} I wyll prayse thee O God among the people: I wyll sing psalmes vnto thee among the nations.
{108:4} For the greatnes of thy mercy reacheth vnto the heauens: and thy trueth vnto the cloudes.
{108:5} Exalt thy selfe O Lord aboue the heauens: and let thy glory be aboue all the earth.
{108:6} That thy beloued may be deliuered: saue me with thy right hande, and heare thou me.
{108:7} The Lorde hath spoken this in his holynes (whereof I wyll reioyce:) I wyll deuide Sichem, and measure the valley of Sucoth.
{108:8} Gilead shalbe myne, and Manasses shalbe mine: Ephraim also shalbe the strength of my head, and Iuda my law geuer.
{108:9} Moab shalbe my washpot: ouer Edome I wyll cast my shoe, vpon Philistea I wyll triumph.
{108:10} Who wyll leade me into the strong citie? who wyll bring me into Edom?
{108:11} Hast not thou remoued vs from thence? and wylt not thou O Lorde go out with our hoastes?
{108:12} Geue vs ayde against trouble: for the sauing helpe of man is but vayne.
{108:13} Through the Lorde wyll we do valiaunt actes: for he him selfe will treade downe our enemies.
{109:1} To the chiefe musition, a psalme of Dauid. Holde not thy tongue: O thou the Lorde of my prayse.
{109:2} For the mouth of the vngodly and the mouth of the deceiptfull is opened vpon me: they haue spoken against me with a false tongue.
{109:3} And they haue compassed me about with hatefull wordes: and fought against me without a cause.
{109:4} For the loue that I bare vnto them, they are become mine aduersaries: but I geue my selfe vnto prayer.
{109:5} Thus haue they rewarded me euyll for good: and hatred for my good wyll.
{109:6} Set thou an vngodly man to be ruler ouer him: and let Satan stande at his right hande.
{109:7} When sentence is geuen vpon hym, let him be condemned: and let his prayer be turned into sinne.
{109:8} Let his dayes be fewe: and let another take his office.
{109:9} Let his chyldren be fatherlesse: and his wyfe a wydowe.
{109:10} Let his children be vagaboundes and go a begging: and let them seeke foode out of their barren groundes.
{109:11} Let the extortioner bryng into his snare all that he hath: and let straungers spoyle his labour.
{109:12} Let there be no man to shewe hym any gentlenes: nor to haue compassion vpon his fatherlesse children.
{109:13} Let his posteritie come to destruction: and in the next generation let his name be cleane put out.
{109:14} Let the wyckednes of his fathers be had in remembraunce in the sight of God: and let not the sinne of his mother be wyped away.
{109:15} Let them be alway before God: that he may roote out the memorial of them from the earth.
{109:16} Because that he remembred not to do good: but he persecuted the afflicted and poore man, and hym whose heart was broken with sorow, that he might take his life from hym.
{109:17} His delight was in cursing, and it shal happen vnto him: he loued not blessing, therfore it hath ben farre from him.
{109:18} He clothed hym selfe with cursing, as with his garment: and it hath entred into his bowels like water, and like oyle into his bones.
{109:19} Let it be vnto hym as the garment that he is wrapt in: and as the gyrdle that he is alway gyrded withall.
{109:20} Let this rewarde be from God vnto myne aduersaries: and vnto those that speake euill against my soule.
{109:21} But thou O God my Lorde, do vnto me according vnto thy name: for sweete is thy mercy.
{109:22} Deliuer me, for truely I am afflicted: and I am poore, and my heart is wounded within me.
{109:23} I passe away like a vading shadowe: and I am dryuen from place to place lyke the grashopper.
{109:24} My knees are weake through fasting: my fleshe is dryed vp for want of fatnesse.
{109:25} I am become also a reproche vnto them: they gase vpon me and they shake their head.
{109:26} Helpe me O my Lorde: oh saue me according to thy mercy.
{109:27} And let the know how that this is thy hande: & that thou O God hast done it.
{109:28} They will curse, but thou wylt blesse: they wyl rise vp against me but let them be confounded, and thy seruaunt wyll reioyce.
{109:29} Let mine aduersaries be clothed with shame: & let them couer the selues with their owne cofusion, as with a garment.
{109:30} As for me I will greatly prayse God with my mouth: and I wyll prayse hym among the multitude.
{109:31} For he wyll stande at the right hande of the poore: to saue him from the iudges of his soule.
{110:1} A psalme of Dauid. God sayd vnto my Lorde: sit thou on my right hande, vntyll I make thyne enemies thy footestoole.
{110:2} God wyll sende the scepter of his power out of Sion: rule thou in the midst of thyne enemies.
{110:3} Thy people wyll be very wyllyng in the time of shewing thy most mightie power with a beautifull holynes: the deawe of thy byrth is to thee from the wombe as from the morning.
{110:4} God sware and he wyll not repent: thou art a priest for euer after the order of Melchisedec.
{110:5} The Lorde at thy right hande: wyll wounde euen kinges in the day of his wrath.
{110:6} He wyll iudge the Heathen: he wyll fill euery place with dead bodyes, he wyll smyte the head of a great countrey.
{110:7} He wyll drinke of the swyft running brooke in the way: therfore he wyll lift vp his head.
{111:1} Prayse ye the Lorde. I wyll prayse God with my whole heart: in the congregation and assemblie of righteous men.
{111:2} Great are the workes of God: sought out of all them that haue pleasure therin.
{111:3} His worke is glory and maiestie: and his righteousnes endureth for euer.
{111:4} The merciful and gratious God: hath so left a remembraunce of his meruaylous workes.
{111:5} He hath geuen meate vnto them that feare him: he wyll euer be myndfull of his couenaunt.
{111:6} He hath declared vnto his people the force of his workes: in geuing them the inheritaunce of the Heathen.
{111:7} The workes of his handes are veritie and iudgement: all his commaundementes are true.
{111:8} They be set sure for euer and euer: they are done in trueth and equitie.
{111:9} He did sende redemption vnto his people: he hath commaunded his couenaunt to be for euer, holy and terrible is his name.
{111:10} The beginning of wysdome is the feare of God: all they haue a good vnderstanding that do his commaundements, the praise of it endureth for euer.
{112:1} Prayse ye the Lorde. Blessed is the man that feareth God: he hath great delight in his commaundementes.
{112:2} His seede shalbe mightie vpon the earth: the generation of them that dwell vprightly, shalbe blessed.
{112:3} Riches and plenteousnes shalbe in his house: and his righteousnes endureth for euer.
{112:4} There ariseth vp light in the darknes: vnto them that deale vprightly he is merciful, and louing, and righteous.
{112:5} A good man is mercyfull and lendeth: he wyll guyde his wordes with discretion.
{112:6} For he shalbe neuer moued: and the righteous shall be had in an euerlasting remembraunce.
{112:7} He wyll not be afraide of any euyll tidinges: his heart is setled, he beleueth in God.
{112:8} His heart is strengthened, he will not feare: vntyll he seeth a mischiefe to fall vpon his enemies.
{112:9} He hath distributed abrode, he hath geuen to the poore: his righteousnes remayneth for euer, his horne shalbe exalted with glory.
{112:10} The vngodly shall see it, and it wyll greeue hym, he wyll gnashe with his teethe and consume away: the desire of the vngodly shall perishe.
{113:1} Prayse ye the Lorde. Prayse God ye seruauntes: prayse ye the name of God.
{113:2} Blessed be the name of God: from this time foorth for euermore.
{113:3} The name of God is to be praysed: from the rising vp of the sunne, vnto the goyng downe of the same.
{113:4} God is high aboue all Heathen: and his glory aboue the heauens.
{113:5} Who is like vnto God our Lord that dwelleth on hygh aboue all:
{113:6} (113:5) and yet humbleth him selfe to beholde the thinges that are in heauen and in earth?
{113:7} (113:6) He rayseth vp the simple out of the dust: and lyfteth vp the poore from the dounghyll.
{113:8} (113:7) For to make him sit with the princes: euen with the princes of his people.
{113:9} (113:8) He maketh the barren woman to kepe house: and to be a ioyful mother of children. Prayse ye the Lorde.
{114:1} When Israel came out of Egypt: & the house of Iacob from among the barbarous people.
{114:2} Iuda was his holynesse: and Israel his dominion.
{114:3} The sea sawe that and fled: Iordane was driuen backe.
{114:4} The mountaynes skypped lyke rammes: and the litle hilles like young lambes.
{114:5} What ayleth thee O thou sea that thou fleddest? and thou Iordane that thou wast driuen backe?
{114:6} Ye mountaines what ayled you that ye skipped lyke rammes: and ye litle hilles like young lambes?
{114:7} Tremble thou earth at the presence of the Lorde: at the presence of the Lorde of Iacob.
{114:8} Whiche turned the harde rocke into a standing water: and the flint stone into a springing well of waters.
{115:1} Geue praise not vnto vs O God, not vnto vs, but vnto thy name: for thy louing mercy, and for thy truethes sake.
{115:2} Wherfore shal the Heathen say: where is nowe their God?
{115:3} Truely our Lorde is in heauen: he hath done whatsoeuer pleased him.
{115:4} Their idols are siluer and gold: euen the workes of mens handes.
{115:5} They haue a mouth and speake not: they haue eyes and see not.
{115:6} They haue eares and heare not: they haue noses and smell not.
{115:7} They haue handes and handle not, they haue feete and walke not: and they vtter no sounde out of their throtes.
{115:8} They that make them are lyke vnto them: euery one that putteth his trust in them.
{115:9} But Israel trust thou in God: he is their ayde and their shielde.
{115:10} Ye house of Aaron trust you in God: he is their ayde and their shielde.
{115:11} Ye that feare God, trust ye in God: he is their ayde and their shielde.
{115:12} God hath ben myndfull of vs, he wyll blesse vs: he wyll blesse the house of Israel, he wyll blesse the house of Aaron.
{115:13} He wyll blesse those that feare God: the small with the great.
{115:14} God wyll encrease you more and more: both you and also your children.
{115:15} Ye are the blessed of God: which made heauen and earth.
{115:16} The heauen, the heauen I say is Gods: and he hath geuen the earth vnto the children of men.
{115:17} The dead prayse not thee O Lorde: neither all they that go downe into the place of scilence.
{115:18} But we wyll prayse the Lord: from this tyme foorth for euermore. Prayse ye the Lorde.
{116:1} I haue loued: because God hath hearde my voyce and my prayers.
{116:2} Because he hath enclined his eare vnto me: therfore I wyll call vpon hym as long as I lyue.
{116:3} The snares of death compassed me rounde about: and the paynes of hell toke holde on me. (116:4) I founde anguishe and heauinesse,
{116:4} but I called vpon the name of God: saying O God, I beseche thee deliuer my soule
{116:5} Gratious is God and ryghteous: our Lorde is mercifull.
{116:6} God gardeth the simple: I was brought to the extremitie, and he preserued me.
{116:7} Returne O my soule vnto thy rest: for God hath rewarded thee.
{116:8} For thou O Lorde hast deliuered my soule from death: myne eyes from teares, and my feete from fallyng.
{116:9} I wyll walke before the face of God: in the lande of the lyuyng.
{116:10} I beleued, therfore I wyll speake: I was sore afflicted,
{116:11} (116:10) insomuch that I said in my rashnesse euery man is a lyer.
{116:12} (116:11) What rewarde shal I geue vnto God: for all the benefites that he hath done vnto me?
{116:13} (116:12) I wyll take the cuppe of saluation: and I wyll call vpon the name of God.
{116:14} (116:13) I wyll pay my vowes nowe vnto God: in the presence of all his people.
{116:15} (116:14) The death of his saintes: is precious in the eyes of God.
{116:16} (116:15) It is euen so O God, for I am thy seruaunt and the sonne of thy handemayde: thou hast loosed my bondes in sunder.
{116:17} (116:16) I wyll offer vnto thee the sacrifice of thankesgeuyng: and I wyll call vpon the name of God.
{116:18} (116:17) I wyll pay my vowes vnto God in the sight of all his people:
{116:19} (116:17) in the courtes of Gods house, euen in the myddest of thee O Hierusalem. Prayse ye the Lorde.
{117:1} O prayse God all ye heathen: prayse hym all ye nations.
{117:2} For his mercifull kyndnesse is euer more and more towarde vs: and the trueth of God endureth for euer. Prayse ye the Lorde.
{118:1} O confesse you it vnto God, for he is gratious: and his mercie endureth for euer.
{118:2} Let Israel nowe confesse: that his mercie endureth for euer.
{118:3} Let the house of Aaron nowe confesse: that his mercie endureth for euer.
{118:4} Let them nowe that feare God: confesse that his mercie endureth for euer.
{118:5} I called vpon the Lorde beyng in distresse: and the Lorde hath hearde me at large.
{118:6} God is with me: I wyll not feare what man can do vnto me.
{118:7} God is with me amongst them that ayde me: therfore I shall see my desire vpon them that hate me.
{118:8} It is better to trust in God: then to put any confidence in man.
{118:9} It is better to trust in God: then to put any confidence in princes.
{118:10} All nations compassed me rounde about: but I trusted in the name of God that I shoulde destroy them.
{118:11} They kept me in on euery syde, they kept me in I say on euery syde: but I trusted in the name of God that I shoulde destroy them.
{118:12} They swarmed about me lyke bees, and they be extinguished as the fire made of thornes: for I trusted in the name of God that I should destroy them.
{118:13} Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall: but God dyd ayde me
{118:14} The Lorde is my strength and my song: and he is become my saluation.
{118:15} The voyce of a ioyfull noyse & of saluation is in the dwellynges of the ryghteous: saying the ryght hande of God bryngeth mightie thynges to passe.
{118:16} The ryght hande of God is on hygh: the right hande of God bryngeth mightie thynges to passe.
{118:17} I shall not as yet dye, but I shal liue: and I wyll declare the workes of the Lorde.
{118:18} The Lorde hath greatly chastened me: but he hath not geuen me ouer vnto death.
{118:19} Open me the gates of ryghteousnesse, I wyll enter in by them: that I may geue thankes vnto the Lorde.
{118:20} This is the gate of God: the ryghteous shall enter in by it.
{118:21} I wyll thanke thee for that thou hast heard me: and art become my saluation.
{118:22} The same stone which the buylders refused: is become the head stone of the corner.
{118:23} This was the doyng of God: and it is marueylous in our eyes.
{118:24} This is the day whiche God hath made: we wyll reioyce and be glad in it.
{118:25} O God I pray thee nowe saue vs: O God I pray thee nowe geue vs prosperous successe.
{118:26} Blessed be he that commeth in the name of God: we do blesse you out of the house of God.
{118:27} It is the Lord God who hath geuen vs lyght: bynde a sacrifice with cordes vnto the hornes of the aulter.
{118:28} Thou art my Lorde, and I wyll confesse it vnto thee: thou art my Lorde and I wyll magnifie thee.
{118:29} O confesse you it vnto God, for he is gratious: and his mercie endureth for euer.
{119:1} Aleph. Blessed are those that be perfect in the way: walkyng in the lawe of God.

{119:51} (119:3) The proude haue had me exceedingly in derision: yet I haue not shrinked from thy lawe.
{119:52} (119:4) For I called to remembraunce thy iudgementes from the begynnyng of the worlde O God: and so I comforted my selfe.
{119:53} (119:5) An extreme vnnaturall heat hath assayled me, because of the vngodly: who transgresse thy lawe.

{119:59} (119:3) I haue considered mine owne wayes: and I haue turned my feete vnto thy testimonies.
{119:60} (119:4) I made haste and I made no delay: for to kepe thy commaundementes.
{119:61} (119:5) The vngodly haue tangled me in their snares: but I haue not forgotten thy lawe.
{119:62} (119:6) I wyll ryse at midnight to confesse me vnto thee: because of thy ryghteous iudgementes.
{119:63} (119:7) I am a companion of all them that feare thee: and kepe thy commaundementes.
{119:64} (119:8) The earth O God is replenished with thy louyng kyndnesse: O teache me thy statutes.
{119:65} Teth (119:1) O God thou hast dealt gratiouslye with thy seruaunt: according vnto thy worde.
{119:66} (119:2) Learne me the good taste & cunning: for I haue beleued thy commaundementes.

{119:68} (119:4) Thou art good and beneficiall: teache me thy statutes.
{119:69} (119:5) The proude haue forged a false tale agaynst me: but I wyll kepe thy commaundementes with my whole heart.
{119:70} (119:6) Their heart is as fat as brawne: but my delyght hath ben in thy lawe.
{119:71} (119:7) It is good for me that I am brought into miserie: by that meanes I shall learne thy statutes.
{119:72} (119:8) The lawe of thy mouth is dearer vnto me: then thousandes of golde & siluer.
{119:73} Iod (119:1) Thy handes haue made me and fashioned me: geue me vnderstanding, and I will learne thy comaundementes.
{119:74} (119:2) They that feare thee, shall see me, & reioyce: because I haue geuen earnest attendaunce vnto thy worde.
{119:75} (119:3) I know O God that thy iudgementes are iustice: and that thou hast caused me ryghtfully to be afflicted.
{119:76} (119:4) I beseche thee let thy louing kindnesse be a meanes to comfort me: accordyng to thy worde spoken vnto thy seruaunt.
{119:77} (119:5) Let thy pitifull mercies come vnto me, that I may lyue: for thy lawe is my delyght.

{119:80} (119:8) Let myne heart be perfectly set in thy statutes: that I be not ashamed.
{119:81} Caph (119:1) My soule hath faynted after thy saluation: I geue earnest attedaunce vnto thy worde.
{119:82} (119:2) Myne eyes haue faynted after thy worde: whylest I say, when wilt thou comfort me.
{119:83} (119:3) For I am become like a bottel hanged in the smoke: yet I do not forget thy statutes.
{119:84} (119:4) Howe many are the dayes of thy seruaunt? when wilt thou geue iudgement agaynst them that persecute me?
{119:85} (119:5) The proude haue digged pittes for me: which is a thing not done accordyng to thy lawe.
{119:86} (119:6) All thy commaundementes are the trueth it selfe: they wrongfully persecute me, O be thou my ayde.
{119:87} (119:7) They had almost made an ende of me vpon the earth: but I forsoke not thy commaundementes.
{119:88} (119:8) Make me to lyue accordyng to thy pietie: and I wyll kepe the testimonies of thy mouth.
{119:89} Lamed (119:1) O God: thy worde endureth for euer in heauen.
{119:90} (119:2) Thy trueth appeareth to euery generation: thou hast layde the foundation of the earth, and it shall continue.
{119:91} (119:3) All thynges continue this day accordyng to thine ordinaunce: for all thinges be thy seruauntes.
{119:92} (119:4) If my delight had not ben in thy lawe: I shoulde haue perished in myne affliction.
{119:93} (119:5) I wyll neuer forget thy commaundementes: for through them thou hast reuiued me.
{119:94} (119:6) I am thine, saue me: for I haue diligently studied thy commaundementes ouer.
{119:95} (119:7) When the vngodly layde wayte for me to destroy me: I endeuoured my selfe to vnderstande thy testimonies.
{119:96} (119:8) I see an ende of euery thing be it neuer so perfect: but thy commaundement is exceedyng large.
{119:97} Mem (119:1) Howe greatly do I loue thy lawe? my study is all the day long in it.
{119:98} (119:2) Thou hast made me wyser then myne enemies through thy commaundementes: for they are euer with me.
{119:99} (119:3) I am able to geue better instruction then all they that were my teachers: for thy testimonies are my study.
{119:100} (119:4) I am made to vnderstande more then the aged can: because I kept thy commaundementes.
{119:101} (119:5) I haue rstrayned my feete from euery euyll way: that I may kepe thy worde.
{119:102} (119:6) I haue not shrinked from thy iudgementes: for thou didst teache me.
{119:103} (119:7) Howe sweete are thy wordes vnto my throte: truely they be sweeter then hony is to my mouth.
{119:104} (119:8) Through thy commaundementes I get vnderstandyng: therfore I hate all wayes of falshood.
{119:105} Nun (119:1) Thy worde is a candell vnto my feete: and a lyght vnto my pathes.
{119:106} (119:2) I haue made an oth (which I wil ratifie) for to kepe thy iuste iudgementes.
{119:107} (119:3) I am troubled aboue measure: quicken me O God accordyng vnto thy worde.
{119:108} (119:4) Let the freewyll offerynges of my mouth please thee O God: and teache me thy iudgementes.
{119:109} (119:5) My soule is alway in my hande: yet I do not forget thy lawe.
{119:110} (119:6) The vngodly haue layde a snare for me: but yet I swarued not from thy commaundementes.
{119:111} (119:7) I haue claymed thy testimonies as myne heritage for euer: for they are the very ioy of myne heart.
{119:112} (119:8) I haue applyed myne heart for to fulfyll thy statutes: euen to the worldes ende.
{119:113} Samech (119:1) I hate hygh subtile deuices: and I do loue thy lawe.

{119:115} (119:3) Auoyde from me ye malicious persons: and I wyll kepe the commaundementes of my Lorde.
{119:116} (119:4) Strengthen me in thy worde and I shall lyue: and make me not ashamed of my hope.
{119:117} (119:5) Holde thou me vp and I shalbe safe: and I will loke gladly vpon thy statutes alwayes.
{119:118} (119:6) Thou hast troden vnder foote all them that go astray from thy statutes: for their crafty deuice is but falshood.
{119:119} (119:7) Thou hast dispatched out of the way all the vngodly of the earth lyke drosse: therfore I loue thy testimonies.
{119:120} (119:8) My fleshe trembleth for feare of thee: and I am afrayde of thy iudgementes.
{119:121} Ain (119:1) I haue executed iudgement and iustice: wherfore leaue me not to such as do offer me wrong.
{119:122} (119:2) For thy owne goodnesse sake take thy seruaunt vnto thy protection: let not the proude oppresse me with wrong.
{119:123} (119:3) Myne eyes haue faynted with lokyng for thy saluation: and for the worde of thy ryghteousnesse.
{119:124} (119:4) Deale with thy seruaunt accordyng vnto thy owne louyng kyndnesse: and teache me thy statutes.
{119:125} (119:5) I am thy seruaunt, graunt me vnderstandyng: that I may knowe thy testimonies.
{119:126} (119:6) It is tyme for me to do for Gods cause: for they haue brought thy lawe almost to nothyng.

{119:128} (119:8) Therfore I take all thy commaundementes euery one of them to be ryght: & I vtterly hate all wayes of falshood.
{119:129} Pe (119:1) Thy testimonies contayne wonderfull thinges: therfore doth my soule kepe them.

{119:132} (119:4) Loke thou vpon me and be mercifull vnto me: as thou vsest to do vnto those that loue thy name.
{119:133} (119:5) Direct my steppes in thy worde: and so shall no wickednesse haue dominion ouer me.

{119:135} (119:7) Make the lyght of thy countenaunce shyne vpon thy seruaunt: and teache me thy statutes.
{119:136} (119:8) Ryuers of waters gushe out of myne eyes: because men kepe not thy lawe.
{119:137} Sade (119:1) O God: thou art iust and vpryght in thy iudgementes.
{119:138} (119:2) Thou hast commaunded the iustice and the veritie of thy testimonies: to be obserued very strayghtly.
{119:139} (119:3) My zeale hath consumed me: because myne aduersaries haue forgotten thy wordes.
{119:140} (119:4) Thy worde is purified to the vttermost: and thy seruaunt loueth it.
{119:141} (119:5) I am small and of no reputation: yet I do not forget thy comaundementes.
{119:142} (119:6) Thy ryghteousnesse is an euerlastyng righteousnesse: & thy lawe is the trueth.

{119:148} (119:4) Myne eyes haue preuented the nyght watches: that my study might be wholy in thy wordes.
{119:149} (119:5) Heare my voyce accordyng to thy louing kindnesse: make me to lyue O God after thy iudgementes.
{119:150} (119:6) They that mynde to do an act of mischiefenesse, do drawe nye vnto me: they are farre from thy lawe.

{119:153} Resh (119:1) Beholde myne affliction & deliuer me: for I haue not forgotten thy lawe.
{119:154} (119:2) Defende thou my cause & redeeme me: make me to lyue accordyng vnto thy worde.
{119:155} (119:3) Saluation is farre from the vngodly: for they study not thy statutes.
{119:156} (119:4) Thy mercies be manifolde O God: make me to liue accordyng to thy iudgementes.
{119:157} (119:5) There be many that do persecute me and be myne aduersaries: yet I do not swarue from thy testimonies.

{119:159} (119:7) Beholde howe I loue thy commaundementes: quicken me O God accordyng to thy louyng kindnesse.
{119:160} (119:8) The beginning of thy word is trueth: and all the iudgementes of thy ryghteousnesse endure for euermore.
{119:161} Shin (119:1) Princes haue persecuted me without a cause: but my heart hath stoode in awe of thy wordes.
{119:162} (119:2) I am as glad of thy worde: as he that fyndeth a great bootie.
{119:163} (119:3) That which is false I hate and abhorre: but thy lawe I do loue.
{119:164} (119:4) I do prayse thee seuen tymes euery day: for loue of the iudgementes of thy iustice.
{119:165} (119:5) They that loue thy lawe shall haue great prosperitie: and nothyng shall offende them.

{119:170} (119:2) Let my supplication come before thee: deliuer me accordyng to thy worde.
{119:171} (119:3) My lippes shall powre out thy prayse: when thou hast taught me thy statutes.
{119:172} (119:4) My tongue shall syng of thy worde: for all thy commaundementes are ryghteousnesse.
{119:173} (119:5) Let thyne hande be redie for to ayde me: for I haue chosen thy commaundementes.
{119:174} (119:6) I haue longed for thy saluation O God: and thy lawe is my whole delight
{119:175} (119:7) Let my soule lyue, and it shall prayse thee: and thy iudgementes shalbe an ayde vnto me.
{119:176} (119:8) I haue gone astray lyke a lost sheepe: oh seke out thy seruaunt, for I haue not forgotten thy commaundementes.
{120:1} A song of high degrees. When I was in trouble I called vpon God: and he hearde me.
{120:2} Deliuer my soule O God from false lyppes: & from a deceiptful tongue.
{120:3} What doth a deceiptfull tongue vnto thee? what good bryngeth it thee?
{120:4} So much as sharpe arrowes of a strong man in thy sydes: with Iuniper coales powred on thy head.
{120:5} Wo be vnto me that am constrayned to be conuersaunt in Mesech: and to dwell among the tentes of Cedar.
{120:6} My soule hath dwelt long: with hym that hateth peace.
{120:7} I am a man of peace: but because I do speake therof, they prepare them selues to battayle.
{121:1} A song of high degrees. I will lift vp myne eyes vnto the hilles: from whence my helpe shall come.
{121:2} My helpe commeth from God: who hath made heauen and earth.
{121:3} He wyll not suffer thy foote to moue: he wyll not sleepe that kepeth thee.
{121:4} Beholde, he that kepeth Israel: wyll neither slumber nor sleepe.
{121:5} God hym selfe is thy keper: God is thy defence vpon thy ryght hande.
{121:6} The sunne shal not hurt thee by day: neither the moone by nyght.
{121:7} God wyll preserue thee from all euill: he wyll preserue thy soule.
{121:8} God wyll preserue thy goyng out and thy commyng in: from this tyme foorth for euermore.
{122:1} A song of high degrees of Dauid. I was glad when they sayde vnto me: we wyll go into the house of God.
{122:2} Our feete shall stande in thy gates: O Hierusalem.
{122:3} Hierusalem is builded: as a citie that is well vnited together in it selfe.
{122:4} For the tribes do go vp thyther, euen the tribes of the Lorde: which is a testimonie vnto Israel for to prayse the name of God.
{122:5} For there is ordeyned the seate for iudgement: euen the seate of the house of Dauid.
{122:6} Pray for the peace of Hierusalem: they shall prosper that loue thee.
{122:7} Peace be within thy walles: and plenteousnesse within thy palaces.
{122:8} For my brethren and companions sakes: I wyll wyshe peace to be within thee.
{122:9} Yea because of the house of God our Lord: I wyll procure to do thee good.
{123:1} A song of high degrees. I lyft vp myne eyes vnto thee: who dwellest in heauen.
{123:2} Beholde, as the eyes of seruauntes loke vnto the hande of their maisters, and as the eyes of a mayden vnto the hande of her maistresse: euen so our eyes wayte vpon God our Lorde vntyll he haue mercie vpon vs.
{123:3} Haue mercy vpon vs O God, haue mercy vpon vs: for we haue suffered enough of dispite.
{123:4} Our soule is filled with the scornefull reprofe of the wealthy: and with the dispitefulnes of the proude.
{124:1} A song of high degrees, of Dauid. If God him selfe had not ben of our side Israel may now say:
{124:2} (124:1) if God him self had not ben of our side when men rose vp against vs,
{124:3} (124:2) Then they had swalowed vs vp quicke: when their wrath was so inflamed against vs.
{124:4} (124:3) Then the waters had drowned vs: the running streame had flowed ouer our soule.
{124:5} (124:4) Then the waters of the proude: had flowed ouer our soule.
{124:6} (124:5) But blessed be God, whiche hath not geuen vs ouer for a pray vnto their teeth.
{124:7} (124:6) Our soule is escaped, euen as a byrde out of the snare of the fouler: the snare is broken, and we be escaped.

{125:1} A song of high degrees. They that put their trust in God be as the mount Sion: whiche may not be remoued but must stande fast for euer.
{125:2} As for Hierusalem, hilles be rounde about it: and God is rounde about his people from this tyme foorth for euermore.
{125:3} For the scepter of the vngodly shall not rest vpon the lot of the righteous: lest the righteous put their handes vnto wickednes.
{125:4} Be beneficiall O God: vnto those that be good and vpright in their heart.
{125:5} And such as do wander in their owne peruersnes, those God will cause to walke with the workers of wickednes: so peace shalbe vpon Israel.
{126:1} A song of high degrees. When God shall cause them of Sion that were led into captiuitie for to returne: we shalbe as men that dreamed.
{126:2} Then shall our mouth be filled with a laughter: and our tongue with a ioyfull noyse. (126:3) Then shall suche as be amongst the Heathen say: God hath brought great thinges to passe, that he myght do for them.
{126:3} (126:4) God hath brought great thinges to passe for vs: we be made merie.
{126:4} (126:5) Make vs O God that be led into captiuitie: for to returne as riuers into the south.
{126:5} (126:6) They that sowe in teares: shall reape in ioy.
{126:6} (126:7) He that goeth foorth on his way, and wepyng beareth pretious seede: shall doubtlesse returning, come againe with a ioyfull noyse, bryngyng his sheaues with hym.
{127:1} A song of high degrees (made) for Solomon. If GOD wyll not buylde the house, they labour in vayne that buylde it: if God kepe not the citie, the watchman waketh in vayne.
{127:2} Is it is a vayne thing for you that ye make haste to ryse vp early, that ye make delayes to take rest, eatyng the bread of sorowes: euen so he geueth sleepe to his welbeloued.
{127:3} Beholde, chyldren be the inheritage of God: and the fruite of the wombe is a rewarde.
{127:4} Like as arrowes be in the hande of the strong: euen so are the chyldren of youth.
{127:5} Happy is the man that hath filled his quiuer with them: they shall not be ashamed when they speake with their enemies in the gate.
{128:1} A song of high degrees. He is blessed whatsoeuer he be that feareth God: walking in his waies.
{128:2} For thou shalt eate the labours of thine handes: thou shalt be happy, and all shall go well with thee.

{128:4} (128:5) Beholde, for thus shall the man be blessed: that feareth God.
{128:5} (128:6) God wyll blesse thee out of Sion: and thou shalt see Hierusalem in prosperitie all the dayes of thy lyfe.

{129:1} A song of high degrees. Israel may now say: they haue troubled me often from my youth vp.
{129:2} They haue troubled me often from my youth vp: but they haue not preuayled against me.
{129:3} The plowemen plowed vpon my backe: they made long forrowes.
{129:4} But God who is iust: hath cut a peeces the snares of the vngodly.
{129:5} All they that beare an euyll wyll to Sion: shalbe confounded, and be made to turne backe from it.
{129:6} They shall be as the grasse growing vpon the house toppes: whiche withereth afore that it be shot foorth to his growth.
{129:7} Whereof the mower fylleth not his hande: neither he that byndeth vp the sheaues his armes full.
{129:8} And they which go by, say not so much as the blessing of God be vpon you: we blesse you in the name of God.
{130:1} A song of high degrees. Out of the deepe I haue called vnto thee O God: O Lorde heare my voyce.
{130:2} Let thine eares be attentiue: vnto the voyce of my petition for grace.
{130:3} If thou O God wylt marke what is done amisse: O Lorde who can abide it?
{130:4} For there is pardon of sinne with thee: that thou mayest be feared.
{130:5} I haue wayted for God, my soule haue wayted for hym: and I haue reposed my trust in his worde.
{130:6} My soule lifteth more after God, then watchmen do after the morning: I say more then watchmen do after the mornyng.
{130:7} Israel ought to trust in God, for there is mercy with God: and there is plenteousnes of redemption with him.
{130:8} And he wyll redeeme Israel: from all his sinnes.
{131:1} A song of high degrees (made) of Dauid. O God I am not hygh mynded, I haue no proude lokes: I haue not vsed to walke in greater & waightier matters then I ought to do.
{131:2} Nay I haue restrayned my soule, and kept it lowe like a chylde that is weaned from his mother: yea my soule is within me as a weaned chylde.
{131:3} O Israel repose thou thy trust in God: from this time foorth for euermore.
{132:1} A song of high degrees. O God be mindfull of Dauid: with all his affliction.
{132:2} Who swore vnto God: who made a vowe vnto the most mightie Lorde of Iacob.
{132:3} Saying I wyll not enter into the tabernacle of my house: nor get vp into my bed.
{132:4} I wyll not suffer myne eyes to slepe: nor myne eye liddes to slumber.
{132:5} Untill I finde out a place for the temple of God: an habitation for the most mightie Lorde of Iacob.
{132:6} Beholde, we hearde it to be at Ephratha: we founde it in the fieldes of the forest.
{132:7} We wyll go into his tabernacle: and fall downe on our knees before his footestoole.
{132:8} Aryse O God for to come into thy resting place: thou and the arke of thy strength.
{132:9} Let thy priestes be clothed with righteousnes: and let thy saintes make a ioyfull noyse.
{132:10} For thy seruaunt Dauids sake: turne not away from the face of thyne annoynted.
{132:11} God hath sworne for a trueth vnto Dauid, and he wyll not go from it: I wyll place vpon thy throne some of the fruite of thy body.
{132:12} If thy chyldren wyll kepe my couenaunt and my testimonies whiche I wyll teache them: their chyldren also shall sit vpon thy throne for euermore.
{132:13} For God hath chosen to be in Sion: he had a desire that it might be an habitation for hym.
{132:14} This is sayeth he my rest for euer: heare I wyll dwell, for I haue a desire to it.
{132:15} I wyll aboundauntly powre my blessinges vpon her victuals: and I wyll satisfie her poore with bread.
{132:16} I wyll clothe her priestes with saluation: and her saintes shall make an exceeding ioyfull noyse.
{132:17} I will make there the horne of Dauid to bud vp: I wyll ordayne a light for mine annoynted.
{132:18} I wyll clothe his enemies with shame: but his crowne shall florishe vppon hym selfe.
{133:1} A song of high degrees (made) of Dauid. Beholde howe good and howe pleasaunt a thing it is: that brethren dwel together in vnitie.
{133:2} It is lyke vnto a pretious oyntment powred vpon the head, which runneth downe vpon the beard, euen vpon Aarons beard: which also runneth downe vpon the skyrtes of his garmentes.
{133:3} It is also like vnto the deawe of Hermon: whiche falleth downe vpon the hyll of Sion. (133:4) For God hath commaunded his blessing: and life euerlasting to be where is suche concorde.
{134:1} A song of high degrees. Beholde, blesse God all ye the seruauntes of God: who in the nyght tyme remayne in the house of God.

{135:3} Prayse ye the Lorde, for God is gratious: sing psalmes vnto his name, for it is pleasaunt.
{135:4} For the Lorde hath chosen Iacob vnto hym selfe: and Israel for his owne possession.
{135:5} For I knowe that God is great: and that our Lorde is aboue all gods.
{135:6} God doth whatsoeuer pleaseth hym in heauen and in earth: in the sea, and in all deepe places.
{135:7} He causeth cloudes to ascende from the lowest part of the earth: he maketh it to lighten when it rayneth, he bringeth wyndes out of his treasure houses.
{135:8} He smote the first borne of Egypt: aswell of beast as of man.
{135:9} He sent tokens and wonders into the mydst of thee O Egypt: against Pharao and all his seruauntes.
{135:10} He smote many nations: and slue mightie kinges.
{135:11} Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Bashan: and all the kingdomes of Chanaan.
{135:12} And he gaue their lande for an inheritaunce: euen for an heritaunce to Israel his people.
{135:13} Thy name O God endureth for euer: there wil be a remembraunce of thee O God, from one generation to another.
{135:14} For God wyll iudge his people: and he will be pacified beyng displeased with his seruauntes.
{135:15} As for the idols of the Heathen they are but siluer and golde: the worke of mens handes.
{135:16} They haue a mouth and speake not: they haue eyes but they see not.
{135:17} They haue eares and they heare not: yea there is no breath in their mouth.
{135:18} They that make them are lyke vnto them: and euery one that putteth his trust in them.
{135:19} Blesse God ye the house of Israel: blesse God ye the house of Aaron.
{135:20} Blesse God ye the house of Leui: ye that feare God, blesse God.

{136:25} Who geueth foode vnto all creatures: for his mercy endureth for euer.
{136:26} Confesse you it vnto the Lord of heauen: for his mercy endureth for euer.
{137:1} By the waters of Babylon we sat downe there: also we wept when we remembred Sion.
{137:2} We hanged our harpes on the Salon trees: in the mydst of it.
{137:3} For there they that led vs away captiue required of vs some matter of a song: and for our waylynges myrth, saying sing vs one of the songes of Sion.
{137:4} He aunswered howe can we sing one of the songes of God: in another lande besides our owne?
{137:5} If I forget thee O Hierusalem: let my right hande forget her cunning.
{137:6} Let my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth, if I do not remember thee: yea if I preferre not thee O Hierusalem aboue my most myrth.
{137:7} Remember the chyldren of Edom in the day of Hierusalem: they sayde, downe with it, downe with it, euen to the grounde.
{137:8} O daughter of Babylon who must lye wasted: happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast serued vs.
{137:9} Blessed shall he be: that taketh & throweth thy litle children against the stone.
{138:1} Of Dauid. I wyll geue thankes vnto thee O God with my whole heart: I wyll sing psalmes vnto thee before the gods.
{138:2} I wyll make my lowe obeysaunce towarde thy holy temple: and I wyll prayse thy holy name in respect of thy louing kindnesse and trueth. (138:3) For thou hast magnified thy name: and thy worde aboue all thinges.
{138:3} (138:4) In the day of myne aduersitie I called vpon thee, and thou heardest me: thou enduedst my soule more and more with strength.
{138:4} (138:5) All the kinges of the earth will prayse thee O God: for they haue hearde the wordes of thy mouth.
{138:5} (138:6) Yea they wyll sing of the wayes of God: for great is the glory of God.
{138:6} (138:7) For though God be on high: yet he will haue respect vnto the lowly, and he wyll knowe the proude a farre of.
{138:7} (138:8) If I shall walke in the midst of trouble, thou wylt make me to liue: thou wylt stretche foorth thyne hande vpon the furiousnes of mine enemies, and thy right hande shall saue me.
{138:8} (138:9) God wyll finishe that he hath begun by me: O God thy louing kindnesse endureth for euer, thou wylt not forsake the workes of thyne owne handes.
{139:1} To the chiefe musition, a psalme of Dauid. O God thou hast searched me to the quicke: and thou hast knowen me.
{139:2} Thou knowest my downe sitting & myne vprising: thou vnderstandest my thoughtes long before they be.
{139:3} Thou compassest about my path, and my iourney into all coastes: and thou vsest all my wayes.
{139:4} For there is not a word in my tongue: but beholde thou O Lorde knowest it altogether.
{139:5} Thou hast fashioned me behinde and before: and layde thyne hande vpon me.
{139:6} The knowledge that thou hast of me is marueylous: it is so high that I can not attayne vnto it.
{139:7} Whyther can I go from thy spirite: or whyther can I flee away from thy face?
{139:8} If I ascende vp into heauen, thou art there: if I lay me downe in hell, thou art there also.
{139:9} If I take the wynges of the morning: and go to dwell in the vttermost part of the sea.
{139:10} Euen there also thy hande shall leade me: and thy right hande shall holde me.
{139:11} And yf I say peraduenture the darknesse shall couer me: and the night shalbe day for me,
{139:12} Truely the darknesse shall not darken any thing from thee, and the night shalbe as lyghtsome as the day: darknesse and lyght to thee are both a lyke.
{139:13} For thou hast my reynes in thy possession: thou didst couer me in my mothers wombe.
{139:14} I wyll confesse it vnto thee, for that thy doynges are to be dreaded, I am made after a marueylous sort: thy workes be marueylous, and that my soule knoweth ryght well.
{139:15} The substaunce of my body was not hyd from thee: when I was made in secrete and fashioned with distinct members in my mothers wombe.
{139:16} Thyne eyes dyd see me when I was most imperfect: and in thy booke were written euery day of them wherin the partes of my body were shaped, and no one of them were knowen vnto thee.
{139:17} Howe pretious be thy cogitations towardes me O God? howe greatly be the summe of them increased?
{139:18} I go about to count them, I fynde that they are mo in number then the sande: and yet whyle I am wakyng I am styll with thee.
{139:19} For truely thou wylt slay O Lord the wicked man: and the blood thirstie men to whom I euer say depart ye from me.
{139:20} Who do speake vnto thee in guilefull maner: thou art O God exalted in vayne to thyne enemies.
{139:21} Do not I hate them O God that hate thee? and am not I greeued with those that rise vp agaynst thee?
{139:22} Yea I hate them from the bottome of myne heart: euen as though they were myne enemies.
{139:23} Searche me to the quicke O Lorde, and knowe thou myne heart: proue me and knowe thou my thoughtes.
{139:24} And loke well yf there be any way of peruersnesse in me: and then leade me in the way of the worlde.
{140:1} To the chiefe musition, a Psalme of Dauid. Delyuer me O God from the euyll man: and preserue me from the outragious man.
{140:2} Who in heart imagine mischiefes: and set forwarde to warre euery day.
{140:3} They haue sharpened their tongue lyke a serpent: Adders poyson is vnder their lippes. Selah.
{140:4} Kepe me O God from the handes of the vngodly: preserue me from the outragious man, who haue deuised to thrust my feete from me.
{140:5} The proude haue layde a snare for me, and spread a net abroade with coardes in the high wayes: they haue set trappes for me. Selah.
{140:6} I haue sayde vnto God, thou art my Lorde: heare the voyce of my prayers O God.
{140:7} O Lorde God the strength of my saluation: thou hast couered my head in the day of battayle.
{140:8} Graunt not vnto the vngodly his desires O God: bryng not to passe his mischeuous imagination lest they shoulde be made to proude. Selah.
{140:9} Let the labour of his owne lippe couer him: who is head of them that compasse me about.
{140:10} Let hotte coales be burnyng vpon them: he wyll cast them downe into the fire into deepe pittes, that they may neuer rise vp agayne.
{140:11} A man full of tongue can not prosper vpon the earth: euyll shall hunt the outragious person to ouerthrowe him.
{140:12} I am sure that God wyll dispatche the cause of the afflicted: and he wyll geue iudgement for the needy.
{140:13} Truely the ryghteous wyll confesse it vnto thy name: they that deale vprightlye shall dwell before thy face.
{141:1} A Psalme of Dauid. O God I call vpon thee, haste thee vnto me: geue eare vnto my voyce whylest I crye vnto thee.
{141:2} Let my prayer be directed before thy face as an incense: let the liftyng vp of mine handes be an euenyng sacrifice.
{141:3} Set a watch O God before my mouth: and kepe the doore of my lippes.
{141:4} Inclyne not myne heart to any euyll thyng, wherby I myght commit any vngodly act with men that be workers of iniquitie: and let me not eate of their delicates.
{141:5} I wishe that the ryghteous woulde smite me and reproue me: for it is louing kyndnesse. (141:6) But let not pretious baulmes breake mine head: for as yet euen my prayer is agaynst their wickednesse.
{141:6} (141:7) Let their iudges be thrust downe headlong from a rocke: then they wyll heare my wordes, for they be sweete.
{141:7} (141:8) Our bones lye scattered vpon the graues mouth: lyke as when one breaketh and heweth wood vpon the earth.
{141:8} (141:9) For mine eyes loke vnto thee O God the Lorde: in thee is my trust, cast not my soule out of me.
{141:9} (141:10) Kepe me from the snare which they haue layde foorth for me: and from the trappes of them that be workers of iniquitie.
{141:10} (141:11) Let the vngodly fall together into their owne nettes: but let me in the meane season alwayes escape them.
{142:1} The wise instruction of Dauid, a prayer when he was in the caue. I cryed vnto God with my voyce: euen vnto God I dyd make my supplication.
{142:2} I powred out before his face my cogitations: and I made a declaration of my trouble before his face.
{142:3} When my spirite was ouerwhelmed within me, thou knewest my path: in the way wherein I walked they haue priuily layde a snare for me.
{142:4} When I loked vpon my ryght hande and sawe rounde about me there was no man that woulde knowe me: I had no place to flee vnto, and no man cared for my soule.
{142:5} I cryed vnto thee O God, and sayde: thou art my hope and my portion in the lande of the lyuyng.
{142:6} Consider my complaynt, for I am brought very lowe: deliuer me from my persecutours, for they are to strong for me.
{142:7} Bryng my soule out of prison, that I may prayse thy name: the ryghteous shal compasse me rounde about, because thou hast thus rewarded me.
{143:1} A Psalme of Dauid. Heare my prayer O God, geue eare vnto my desire: hearken vnto me for thy trueth sake, for thy ryghteousnesse sake.
{143:2} And enter not into iudgement with thy seruaunt: for in thy syght no man lyuyng can be iustified.
{143:3} For the enemie hath persecuted my soule, he hath smitten my lyfe downe to the grounde: he hath layde me in darknesse as men that haue ben long dead.
{143:4} And my spirite is ouerwhelmed within me: and my heart is desolate in the midst of me.
{143:5} I call to remembraunce the tyme long past: I muse vpon euery act of thine, I exercise my study on the worke of thy handes.
{143:6} I stretche foorth myne handes vnto thee: my soule as a thirstie lande gaspeth vnto thee. Selah.
{143:7} Make speede, hearken vnto me O God, my spirite waxeth faynt: hyde not thy face from me, for I am lyke vnto them that go downe into the pyt.
{143:8} Cause me to heare of thy louyng kindnesse betymes in the mornyng: for in thee is my trust. (143:9) Make me to knowe the way that I shoulde walke in: for I lyft vp my soule vnto thee.
{143:9} (143:10) Delyuer me O God from myne enemies: I hyde my selfe with thee.
{143:10} (143:11) Teache me to do the thyng that pleaseth thee, for thou art my Lorde: let thy good spirite leade me foorth vnto the lande of ryghteousnesse.
{143:11} (143:12) For thy names sake O God thou wilt cause me to lyue: and for thy righteousnesse sake thou wilt bryng my soule out of trouble.
{143:12} (143:13) And of thy goodnesse thou wylt restrayne myne enemies: and destroy all them that be aduersaries to my soule, for I am thy seruaunt.
{144:1} Of Dauid. Blessed be God my rocke: who teacheth my handes to warre, and my fingers to fyght.
{144:2} My holynesse and my fortresse, my refuge, and my only deliuerer: my buckler, in hym I haue put my trust, who subdueth my people vnder me.
{144:3} O God, what is man that thou doest knowe hym? what is the sonne of man that thou doest thynke of hym?
{144:4} Man is lyke a thyng of naught: his dayes be lyke a shadowe that passeth away.
{144:5} Bowe thy heauens O God and come downe: touche the mountaynes and they shall smoke.
{144:6} Cast out terrible lightninges and feare them: shoote out thyne arrowes and consume them.
{144:7} Sende downe thine hand from aboue: deliuer me and take me out of the great waters, from the hande of the children of an other deuotion then I am.
{144:8} Whose mouth vttereth vanitie: and their ryght hande is a ryght hande of falshood.
{144:9} O Lorde I wyll syng a newe song vnto thee: and I wyll syng psalmes vnto thee vpon a Lute, and vpon an instrument of ten strynges.
{144:10} Who geueth victorie vnto kynges: who redeemeth Dauid his seruaunt from peryll of the sworde.
{144:11} Redeeme me and deliuer me from the hande of the children of an other deuotion then I am: whose mouth vttereth vanitie, and their ryght hande is a ryght hande of falshood.
{144:12} That our sonnes may growe vp in their youth as young plantes: that our daughters may be as corners stones grauen after the fashion as a palace is.
{144:13} That the corners of our houses may be fylled, yeeldyng foorth all maner of stoore: that our cattell may bring foorth thousandes, yea ten thousandes in our streates.
{144:14} That our oxen may be strong to labour that there be no decay: no leadyng into captiuitie, and no complaynyng in our streates.
{144:15} Happy are the people that be in such a case: blessed is the people who haue God for their Lorde.
{145:1} The prayse of Dauid. I will magnifie thee O Lord my king: and I wyll blesse thy name for euer and euer.
{145:2} I wyll blesse thee euery day: and I wyll prayse thy name for euer and euer.

{145:12} That they may make knowen to the children of men his manifolde power: & the glorious maiestie of his kingdome.
{145:13} Thy kingdome is an euerlasting kingdome: and thy dominion endureth throughout all ages.
{145:14} God vpholdeth all such as fall: and lyfteth vp all those that be bowyng downewarde.
{145:15} The eyes of all wayte vpon thee: and thou geuest them their meate in due season.
{145:16} Thou openest thyne hande: and thou satisfiest the desire of euery thing liuing.
{145:17} God is righteous in all his wayes: and holy in all his workes.
{145:18} God is nye vnto all them that call vpon hym: vnto all such as call vpon hym in trueth.

{146:1} Prayse ye the Lord, prayse thou God O my soule, whylest I lyue I wyll prayse God: I wyll syng psalmes vnto my Lorde so long as I shalbe.
{146:2} Put not your trust in princes nor in the sonne of man: in whom there is no saluation.
{146:3} His spirite shall depart out of hym, he shall turne agayne to his earth: at that day all his thoughtes shall perishe.
{146:4} Blessed is he vnto whom the God of Iacob is an ayde: his trust is in God his Lorde.
{146:5} Who made heauen and earth, the sea and all that therin is: who mainteyneth the trueth for euer.
{146:6} Who executeth iudgement for those that are oppressed with wrong: who geueth foode to the hungry.
{146:7} God looseth those that be bounde: God geueth syght to the blynde.
{146:8} God rayseth them vp that are falling: God loueth the ryghteous.
{146:9} God taketh strangers into his custodie, he releeueth the fatherlesse and the widdowe: as for the way of the vngodlye he turneth it vpsyde downe.
{146:10} God thy Lorde shall raigne O Sion, to the worldes ende: throughout all generations. Prayse ye the Lorde.

{147:9} He geueth vnto cattell their foode: euen vnto Rauens which call for it.
{147:10} He hath no pleasure in the strength of an horse: he delighteth not in the legges of a man.
{147:11} God delyghteth in them that feare him: and in them that put their trust in his mercie.
{147:12} Prayse God O Hierusalem: prayse thy Lorde O Sion.
{147:13} For he maketh fast the barres of thy gates: he blesseth thy children within thee.
{147:14} He maketh peace in thy borders: he fylleth thee with good corne.
{147:15} He sendeth foorth his commaundement vpon the earth: his word runneth very swiftly.
