{1:1} Paul a seruaunt of God, & an Apostle of Iesus Christe, according to the fayth of Gods elect, & the knowledge of ye trueth, whiche is after godlynesse,
{1:2} In the hope of eternall lyfe, which God that can not lye, promised before the worlde began:
{1:3} But hath made manifest his worde, at ye time appoynted through preaching, which is committed vnto me, according to the ordinaunce of God our sauiour:
{1:4} To Titus a natural sonne after the common fayth: Grace, mercie, peace, from God the father, and the Lorde Iesus Christe our sauiour.
{1:5} For this cause left I thee in Creta, that thou shouldest refourme ye thynges that are left, and ordayne elders in euerye citie, as I had appoynted thee:
{1:6} If any be blamelesse, the husbande of one wyfe, hauyng faythfull chyldren, not accusable of riote, or vntractable.
{1:7} For a bishop must be blamelesse, as the stewarde of God: not stubborne, not angry, not geuen to wyne, no striker, not geuen to filthie lucre:
{1:8} But a louer of hospitalitie, a louer of goodnes, sober, ryghteous, godly, temperate,
{1:9} Holdyng fast the faythfull worde, which is accordyng to doctrine, that he may be able both to exhort in wholsome doctrine, and to improue them that say agaynst it.
{1:10} For there are many vnruly, and vayne talkers, and deceauers of myndes, specially they that are of ye circumcision,
{1:11} Whose mouthes must be stopped, which subuert whole houses, teachyng thynges which they ought not, for fylthie lucre sake.
{1:12} One of them selues euen a prophete of their owne, sayde: The Crettans are alwayes lyers, euyll beastes, slowe bellyes.
{1:13} This witnesse is true: wherfore rebuke them sharpely that they may be founde in the fayth,
{1:14} Not takyng heede to Iewes fables and comaundementes of men, turnyng from the trueth.
{1:15} Unto the pure, are all thynges pure: but vnto them that are defyled and vnbeleuyng, is nothyng pure, but euen the mynde and conscience of them is defyled.
{1:16} They confesse that they knowe God: but with workes they denie hym, seyng they are abhominable and disobedient, and vnto euery good worke reprobate.
{2:1} But speake thou the thynges which become wholsome doctrine.
{2:2} That the elder men be watchyng, graue, sober, sounde in fayth, in loue, in pacience:
{2:3} The elder women lykewyse, that they be in such behauiour as becometh holynesse, not false accusers, not geuen to much wine, teachers of good thinges,
{2:4} To make the young women sober mynded, to loue their husbandes, to loue their chyldren,
{2:5} (To be) discrete, chaste, house kepers, good, obedient vnto their owne husbandes, that the worde of God be not blasphemed.
{2:6} Young men lykewyse exhort, to be sober mynded.
{2:7} In all thynges shewyng thy selfe a paterne of good workes, in the doctrine, vncorruptnesse, grauitie, integritie,
{2:8} Wholsome worde, vnrebukeable, that he which withstandeth, may be ashamed, hauyng no euyll thyng to say of you.
{2:9} Exhort seruauntes, to be obedient vnto their owne maisters, and to please them in all thynges, not aunsweryng agayne:
{2:10} Neither pickers, but shewing all good faythfulnesse, that they may adourne the doctrine of God our sauiour in all thynges.
{2:11} For there hath appeared the grace of God which is healthful to all men,
{2:12} Teachyng vs, that denying vngodlynesse and worldly lustes, we shoulde lyue soberlie and ryghteouslie, and godlie in this present worlde:
{2:13} Lokyng for that blessed hope and appearyng of the glorie of the great God, and our sauiour Iesus Christe,
{2:14} Which gaue hym selfe for vs, that he myght redeeme vs from all vnryghteousnesse, and pourge vs a peculier people vnto hym selfe, zelous of good workes.
{2:15} These thynges speake and exhort, and rebuke with all aucthoritie. Let no man dispise thee.
{3:1} Warne them to be subiect to rule & power, to obey magistrates, to be redie to euery good worke:
{3:2} To blaspheme no man, to be no fyghters, but gentle, shewyng all mekenesse vnto all men.
{3:3} For we our selues also were some tyme foolyshe, disobedient, deceaued, seruyng diuers lustes & voluptuousnes, lyuyng in maliciousnesse and enuie, full of hate, hatyng one another.
{3:4} But after that the kyndenesse and loue of our sauiour God to manwarde appeared,
{3:5} Not of workes which be in ryghteousnesse wrought, but accordyng to his mercie, he saued vs by the fountayne of regeneration and renuyng of the holy ghost,
{3:6} Which he shed on vs richlie through Iesus Christe our sauiour:
{3:7} That we iustified by his grace, should be made heyres accordyng to the hope of eternall lyfe.
{3:8} This is a faythfull saying: And of these thynges I wyll that thou confirme, that they which haue beleued in God, myght be carefull to shewe foorth good workes. These thynges are good and profitable vnto men.
{3:9} But foolishe questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and striuinges about the lawe, auoyde: for they are vnprofitable and vayne.
{3:10} A man that is an aucthour of sectes, after the first and the seconde admonition, auoyde:
{3:11} Knowyng, that he that is such, is subuerted and sinneth, beyng dampned of hym selfe.
{3:12} When I shall sende Artemas vnto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come vnto me vnto Nicopolis: For I haue determined there to wynter.
{3:13} Bryng Zenas the lawyer, & Apollos, on their iourney diligently, that nothing be lackyng vnto them.
{3:14} And let ours also learne to excell in good workes to necessarie vses, that they be not vnfruitefull.
{3:15} All that are with me, salute thee. Greete them that loue vs in the fayth. Grace be with you all. Amen. Written from Nicopolis, (a citie) of Macedonia.
