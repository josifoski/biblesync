{1:1} Paule called to be an Apostle of Iesu Christ, through the wyll of God, and brother Sostenes:
{1:2} Unto the Church of God whiche is at Corinthus: To the that are sanctified in Christe Iesus, saintes by callyng, with all that call on the name of our Lorde Iesus Christe in euery place, both of theirs and ours:
{1:3} Grace be vnto you, and peace from God our father, and from the Lorde Iesus Christe.
{1:4} I thanke my God alwayes on your behalfe, for the grace of God whiche is geuen you in Iesus Christe:
{1:5} That in all thynges ye are made riche in hym, in all vtteraunce, & in all knowledge:
{1:6} As the testimonie of Iesus Christ was confirmed in you.
{1:7} So that ye are destitute of no gyft, wayting for the appearing of our Lord Iesus Christe,
{1:8} Whiche shall also strength you vnto the ende, that ye may be blamelesse in the day of our Lord Iesus Christ.
{1:9} God is faythfull, by whom ye are called vnto the felowship of his sonne Iesus Christe our Lorde.
{1:10} Nowe I beseche you brethren by the name of our Lorde Iesus Christe, that ye all speake one thyng, and that there be no discentions among you, but be ye knit together, in one mynde, and in one meanyng.
{1:11} For it is shewed vnto me my brethren, of you, by them whiche are of the house of Cloe, that there are contentions among you.
{1:12} Nowe this I saye, that euery one of you saith, I am of Paul, and I am of Apollo, and I am of Cephas, and I am of Christe.
{1:13} Is Christe deuided? was Paul crucified for you? eyther were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
{1:14} I thanke God that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Gaius:
{1:15} Lest any shoulde say, that I had baptized in myne owne name.
{1:16} I baptized also the housholde of Stephana: Furthermore knowe I not whether I baptized any other.
{1:17} For Christe sent me not to baptize, but to preache the Gospell: not with wisedome of wordes, lest ye crosse of Christ shoulde be made of none effect.
{1:18} For the preachyng of the crosse, is to them that perishe foolishnesse: but vnto vs which are saued, it is the power of God.
{1:19} For it is written, I wyll destroye the wisedome of the wyse, and wyll cast away the vnderstandyng of the prudent.
{1:20} Where is the wise? where is ye scribe? where is the disputer of this worlde? Hath not God made the wisedome of this worlde foolyshenesse?
{1:21} For after that the world through wisedome knewe not God, in the wisedome of God: it pleased God through foolishnesse of preachyng to saue them that beleue.
{1:22} For the Iewes require a signe, & the Grekes seke after wisedome:
{1:23} But we preache Christe crucified, vnto the Iewes a stumblyng blocke, and vnto the Grekes foolyshnesse:
{1:24} But vnto them which are called both of the Iewes and Grekes we preache Christe the power of God, and the wisedome of God.
{1:25} For the foolishnesse of God, is wiser then men, and the weakenesse of God, is stronger then men.
{1:26} Brethren, ye see your callyng, howe that not many wise men after the fleshe, not many myghtie, not many noble are called.
{1:27} But God hath chosen the foolyshe thynges of the worlde, to confounde the wise: And God hath chosen the weake thynges of the worlde, to confounde thynges which are myghtie:
{1:28} And vnnoble thynges of the worlde, & thinges which are despysed, hath God chosen, yea and thinges which are not, to bryng to naught thynges that are:
{1:29} That no fleshe shoulde reioyce in his presence.
{1:30} And of hym are ye in Christe Iesu, whiche of God is made vnto vs wisedome, and righteousnesse, and sanctification, and redemption:
{1:31} That accordyng as it is written: he that reioyceth, let hym reioyce in the Lorde.
{2:1} And I brethren, when I came to you, came not in gloriousnesse of wordes, or of wisedome, shewing vnto you the testimonie of God.
{2:2} For I esteemed not to knowe any thyng among you saue Iesus Christe, and hym crucified.
{2:3} And I was among you in weaknesse, and in feare, and in much tremblyng.
{2:4} And my wordes and my preachyng was not with entysing wordes of mans wisedome, but in shewyng of the spirite, and of power:
{2:5} That your fayth should not stande in the wisedome of men, but in the power of God.
{2:6} And we speake wisedome among the that are perfite: not the wisedome of this world, neither of the princes of this world, which come to naught.
{2:7} But we speake the wisedome of God in a misterie euen the hyd wisedome which God ordeyned before the worlde, vnto our glorie.
{2:8} Which none of ye princes of this world knewe: For had they knowen it, they woulde not haue crucified the Lorde of glorie.
{2:9} But as it is written: The eye hath not seen, & the eare hath not heard, neither haue entred into the heart of man, the thynges which God hath prepared for them that loue hym.
{2:10} But God hath reuealed the vnto vs by his spirite: For the spirite searcheth all thinges, yea the deepe thinges of God.
{2:11} For what man knoweth the thynges of a man, saue ye spirite of man which is in hym? Euen so, the thinges of God, knoweth no man, but ye spirite of God.
{2:12} And we haue receaued, not the spirite of the worlde, but the spirite which is of God, that we myght know the thinges that are geuen to vs of God.
{2:13} Which thynges also we speake, not in the wordes which mans wisedome teacheth, but which ye holy ghost teacheth, comparyng spirituall thynges with spirituall thynges.
{2:14} But the naturall man perceaueth not the thynges of ye spirite of God, for they are foolyshenesse vnto hym: Neither can he knowe them because they are spiritually discerned.
{2:15} But he that is spirituall, discerneth all thynges, yet he hym selfe is iudged of no man.
{2:16} For who hath knowen the mynde of the Lorde, that he myght instruct hym? But we haue the mynde of Christe.
{3:1} And I coulde not speake vnto you brethren, as vnto spirituall, but as vnto carnall eue as vnto babes in Christe.
{3:2} I gaue you mylke to drynke, and not meate: For ye then were not stronge, neither are ye as yet.
{3:3} For ye are carnal. Seing then, there is among you enuying, & stryfe, and sectes, are ye not carnall, and walke as men?
{3:4} For whyle one sayth, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollo, are ye not carnall?
{3:5} What is Paul? what is Apollo? Only ministers are they by whom ye beleued, euen as the Lorde gaue to euery man.
{3:6} I haue planted, Apollo watered: but God gaue the encrease.
{3:7} So then, neither is he that planteth any thyng, neither he that watreth: but God that geueth the encrease.
{3:8} He that planteth, & he that watreth, are one, and euery man shal receaue his rewarde accordyng to his labour.
{3:9} For we together are Gods labourers, ye are Gods husbandrie ye are Gods buyldyng.
{3:10} Accordyng to the grace of God geuen vnto me, as a wise maister builder haue I layde the foundation, and another buyldeth theron. But let euery man take heede howe he buyldeth vpon.
{3:11} For other foundation can no man lay, then that that is layde, which is Iesus Christe.
{3:12} If any man buylde on this foundation, golde, syluer, precious stones, tymber, haye or stubble:
{3:13} Euery mans worke shal appeare. The day shall declare it, because it shalbe reuealed by the fire: And the fire shall trie euery mans worke what it is.
{3:14} If any mans worke that he hath built vpon abyde, he shall receaue a reward.
{3:15} If any mans worke burne, he shall suffer losse, but he shalbe safe hym selfe: neuertheles, yet as it were through fire.
{3:16} Knowe ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the spirite of God dwelleth in you?
{3:17} If any man defyle the temple of God, hym shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.
{3:18} Let no man deceaue him selfe. Yf any man among you seeme to be wise in this worlde, let hym be a foole, that he may be wyse.
{3:19} For the wisedome of this worlde, is foolishnesse with God. For it is writte: He compasseth the wise in their own craftynesse.
{3:20} And agayne The Lorde knoweth the thoughtes of the wyse, that they be vayne.
{3:21} Therfore, let no man reioyce in men: For all thynges are yours:
{3:22} Whether it be Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, either the worlde, either lyfe, or death, whether they be present thinges, or thynges to come, all are yours:
{3:23} And ye are Christes, and Christe (is) Gods.
{4:1} Let a man so esteeme of vs, as the ministers of Christe, and disposers of the secretes of God.
{4:2} Furthermore, it is required of the disposers that a man be founde faythfull.
{4:3} With me it is but a very small thyng that I shoulde be iudged of you, either of mans iudgement: No, I iudge not mine owne selfe.
{4:4} For I knowe nothing by my selfe, yet am I not thereby iustified: but he that iudgeth me is the Lorde.
{4:5} Therefore iudge nothyng before the tyme, vntyll the Lorde come, who wyl lyghten thynges that are hyd in darkenesse, & open the counsels of the heartes, and then shall euery man haue prayse of God.
{4:6} And these thynges brethren, I haue figuratiuely applied vnto my selfe, and to Apollos, for your sakes, that ye might learne by vs, that no man conceaue in mynde aboue that whiche is written, that one swell not agaynst another for any mans cause.
{4:7} For who seperateth thee? And what hast thou, that thou hast not receaued? If thou haue receaued it, why reioycest thou, as though thou haddest not receaued it?
{4:8} Nowe ye are full, nowe ye are made ryche, ye raigne as kynges without vs, and I woulde to God ye dyd raigne, that we also myght raigne with you.
{4:9} For me thynketh, that God hath set foorth vs, whiche are the last apostles, as it were men appoynted to death. For we are made a gasyng stocke vnto the worlde, and to the angels, and to men.
{4:10} We are fooles for Christes sake, but ye are wyse in Christe. We are weake, but ye are stronge. Ye are honorable, but we are despised.
{4:11} Euen vnto this time we both hunger and thirste, and are naked, and are buffeted, and haue no certaine dwellyng place.
{4:12} And labour, working with our owne handes. We are reuyled, and we blesse. We are persecuted, and suffer it.
{4:13} We are euyll spoken of, and we praye: we are made as the fylthynesse of the worlde, the ofscowryng of all thynges vnto this day.
{4:14} I write not these thynges to shame you, but as my beloued sonnes I warne you.
{4:15} For though ye haue ten thousande instructours in Christ, yet haue ye not many fathers: For in Christe Iesu I haue begotten you through the Gospell.
{4:16} Wherfore, I desire you, be ye folowers of me.
{4:17} For this cause haue I sent vnto you Timotheus, whiche is my beloued sonne, & faythfull in the Lorde, which shall put you in remembraunce of my wayes which be in Christe, as I teache euery where in all Churches.
{4:18} Some swel as though I would come no more at you:
{4:19} But I wyll come to you shortly, if the Lorde wyll, & wyll knowe, not the wordes of the which swell, but the power.
{4:20} For the kyngdome of God is not in worde, but in power.
{4:21} What wyl ye? Shal I come vnto you with a rodde, or in loue and in the spirite of mekenesse?
{5:1} There goeth a common saying that there is fornication among you, & suche fornication as is not named among the gentiles: that one shoulde haue his fathers wyfe.
{5:2} And ye swell, and haue not rather sorowed, that he that hath so done this deede myght be put from among you.
{5:3} For I veryly, as absent in body, but present in spirite, haue determined alredie, as though I were present, concernyng hym that hath done this deede.
{5:4} In the name of our Lorde Iesus Christe, when ye are gathered together and my spirite, with the power of the Lorde Iesus Christe,
{5:5} To delyuer suche a one vnto Satan for the destruction of the flesshe, that the spirite may be saued in the daye of the Lorde Iesus.
{5:6} Your reioycing is not good. Knowe ye not, that a litle leauen leaueneth the whole lumpe ?
{5:7} Purge out therfore the olde leauen, that ye maye be newe dowe, as ye are vnleauened bread: For Christe our Pasouer is offred vp for vs.
{5:8} Therefore let vs kepe holy day, not with old leauen, neither with the leauen of maliciousnes and wickednesse, but with the vnleauened bread of purenesse and trueth.
{5:9} I wrote vnto you in an epistle, that ye should not companie with fornicatours:
{5:10} And I meant not at all with the fornicatours of this worlde, or with the couetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters: for then must ye needes haue gone out of the world.
{5:11} But nowe I haue written vnto you, that ye companie not together, if any that is called a brother be a fornicatour, or couetous, or a worshipper of idols, or a rayler, or a drunkarde, or an extortioner: with him that is such see that ye eate not.
{5:12} For what haue I to do to iudge them that are without? Do ye not iudge them that are within?
{5:13} (5:12) For what haue I to do to iudge them that are without? Do ye not iudge them that are within? Them that are without God iudgeth. Put away from among you that wicked person.
{6:1} Dare any of you, hauing businesse with another, be iudged vnder the vniust, and not rather vnder ye saintes?
{6:2} Do ye not knowe that the saintes shall iudge the worlde? If the worlde shalbe iudged by you, are ye vnworthy to iudge the smallest matters?
{6:3} Know ye not howe that we shal iudge the angels? Howe much more thinges that parteyne to this lyfe?
{6:4} If then ye haue iudgement of thinges parteynyng to this lyfe, set vp them to iudge whiche are least esteemed in the Churche.
{6:5} I speake it to your shame: Is it so that there is not a wyse man among you? no not one that can iudge betwene brother and brother?
{6:6} But one brother goeth to law with another, and that vnder the vnbeleuers?
{6:7} Nowe therefore there is vtterly a fault among you, because ye go to lawe one with another: Why rather suffer ye not wrong? why rather suffer ye not harme?
{6:8} Nay, ye your selues do wrong, and do harme, and that to your brethren.
{6:9} Knowe ye not that the vnrighteous shall not inherite the kingdome of God? Be not deceaued: neither fornicatours, nor idolatours, nor adulterers, nor weaklinges, nor abusers of them selues with mankinde,
{6:10} Nor theeues, nor couetous, nor drunckardes, nor cursed speakers, nor pyllers, shall inherite the kingdome of God.
{6:11} And such were some of you: but ye are wasshed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are iustified in the name of the Lord Iesus, and by the spirite of our God.
{6:12} All thinges are lawfull vnto me, but al thinges are not profitable: Al things are lawfull vnto me, but I will not be brought vnder the power of any.
{6:13} Meates are ordeyned for the belly, and the belly for meates: but God shall destroy both it, and them. Nowe the body is not for fornication: but for the Lorde, and the Lorde for the body.
{6:14} And God both hath raysed vp the Lorde, and also shall rayse vs vp by his power.
{6:15} Knowe ye not that your bodies are the members of Christe? Shall I then take the members of Christe, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbyd.
{6:16} Know ye not, that he whiche coupleth him selfe with an harlot, is one body? For two (sayth he) shalbe one fleshe.
{6:17} But he that is ioyned vnto the Lord is one spirite.
{6:18} Flee fornication. Euery synne that a man doeth, is without the body: but he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his owne body.
{6:19} Knowe ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost whiche is in you, whom ye haue of God, and ye are not your owne?
{6:20} For ye are dearely bought: therefore glorifie God in your body and in your spirite, which are Gods.
{7:1} Nowe as concernyng the thinges wherof ye wrote vnto me, it is good for a man not to touche a woman.
{7:2} Neuerthelesse, to auoyde fornication, let euery man haue his owne wyfe, and let euery woman haue her owne husband.
{7:3} Let the husbande geue vnto the wyfe due beneuolence: Lykewyse also the wyfe vnto the husbande.
{7:4} The wyfe hath not the power of her owne body, but the husbande: And likewyse also the husbande hath not the power of his owne body, but the wife.
{7:5} Defraude you not the one the other, except it be with both your consentes for a time, that ye may geue your selues to fasting and prayer: and afterward come together againe, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinencie.
{7:6} This I say of fauour, & not of commaundement.
{7:7} For I woulde that all men were as I my selfe am: but euery man hath his proper gift of God, one after this maner, another after that.
{7:8} I say therefore vnto them that be vnmaryed and wyddowes, it is good for them if they abyde euen as I.
{7:9} But if they can not abstayne, let them marrie: For it is better to marrie then to burne.
{7:10} Unto the maryed commaunde, not I, but the Lord, Let not the wyfe depart from the husbande:
{7:11} But and if she depart, let her remayne vnmarried, or be reconciled vnto her husbande againe: And let not the husbande put away his wyfe.
{7:12} But to the renmaunt speake I, not the Lorde: If any brother haue a wife that beleueth not, if she be content to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
{7:13} And the woman which hath to her husbande an infidell, and he consent to dwel with her, let her not put him away.
{7:14} For the vnbeleuing husbande is sanctified by the wyfe, and the vnbeleuyng wyfe is sanctified by the husbande: els were your children vncleane, but nowe are they holy.
{7:15} But if the vnbeleuing depart, let hym depart: A brother or a sister is not in subiection in such thinges: But God hath called vs in peace.
{7:16} For howe knowest thou O woman, whether thou shalt saue thy husbande? or how knowest thou O man, whether thou shalt saue thy wyfe?
{7:17} But as God hath distributed to euery man, as the Lorde hath called euery one, so let hym walke, and so ordeyne I in all Churches.
{7:18} Is any man called beyng circumcised? let him not adde vncircumcision: Is any called vncircumcised? let him not be circumcised.
{7:19} Circumcision is nothing, and vncircumcision is nothing, but the keping of the commaundementes of God.
{7:20} Let euery man abyde in the same calling, wherein he was called.
{7:21} Art thou called a seruaunt? care not for it: Neuerthelesse, if thou mayest be free, vse it rather.
{7:22} For he that is called in the Lord being a seruaunt, is the Lordes free man: Lykewyse also he that is called beyng free, is Christes seruaunt.
{7:23} Ye are dearely bought, be not ye the seruauntes of men.
{7:24} Brethren, let euery man wherin he is called, therin abyde with God.
{7:25} Nowe concerning virgins I haue no commaundement of the Lord: yet geue I counsell, as one that hath obtayned mercy in the Lorde to be faythfull.
{7:26} I suppose therfore that it is good for the present necessitie: for I say it is good for a man so to be.
{7:27} Art thou bounde vnto a wife? seke not to be loosed: Art thou loosed from a wyfe? seke not a wyfe.
{7:28} But and if thou marrie a wyfe, thou sinnest not, and if a virgin marrie, she hath not sinned: Neuerthelesse, such shall haue trouble in their fleshe, but I beare with you.
{7:29} But this say I brethren, the tyme is short: It remayneth, that they which haue wyues, be as though they had none:
{7:30} And they that wepe, as though they wept not: & they that reioyce, as though they reioyced not: and they that bye, as though they possessed not:
{7:31} And they that vse this worlde, as though they vsed it not: For the fashion of this worlde goeth away.
{7:32} I woulde haue you without care: He that is vnmaryed, careth for the thinges that belong to the Lorde, how he may please the Lorde:
{7:33} But he that hath maryed awyfe, careth for the thinges that are of the worlde, how he may please his wyfe.
{7:34} There is difference betweene a virgin and a wyfe: The vnmaryed woman careth for the thinges that are of the Lorde, that she may be holy both in body and in spirite: Againe she that is maryed careth for the thinges that pertayne to the world, how she may please her husbande.
{7:35} This speake I for your profite, not to tangle you in a snare: but that ye may folowe that which is honest and comely, and that ye may cleaue fast vnto the Lorde without separation.
{7:36} But if any man thinke that it is vncomely for his virgin if she passe the time of mariage, and neede so require, let him do what he wyll, he sinneth not: let them be maryed.
{7:37} Neuerthelesse, he that purposeth surely in his heart hauing no neede, but hath power ouer his owne wyll, and hath so decreed in his heart that he wyl kepe his virgin, doth well.
{7:38} So then he that ioyneth his virgin in maryage, doth well: but he that ioyneth not his virgin in mariage, doth better.
{7:39} The wyfe is bounde to the lawe as long as her husbande lyueth: but if her husband be dead, she is at libertie to marry with whom she wil, onely in the Lorde.
{7:40} But she is happier if she so abide, after my iudgement: And I thinke veryly that I haue the spirite of God.
{8:1} As touching thinges offred vnto idols, we are sure yt we all haue knowledge. Knowledge maketh a man swell: but loue edifieth.
{8:2} If any man thynke that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.
{8:3} But if any man loue God, the same is knowen of him.
{8:4} As concerning the eating of those thinges that are offered vnto idols, we are sure that an idoll is nothing in the worlde, and that there is none other God but one.
{8:5} And though there be that are called gods, whether in heauen or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lordes many:)
{8:6} Yet vnto vs is there but one God, which is the father, of whom are all thinges, and we in him, and one Lorde Iesus Christe, by whom are al thinges, and we by him.
{8:7} But euery man hath not knowledge: For some hauing conscience of the idol vntill this houre, eate as a thing offred vnto idols, and so their conscience being weake, is defiled.
{8:8} But meate maketh vs not acceptable to God: For neither if we eate, haue we the more, neither if we eate not, haue we the lesse.
{8:9} But take heede lest by any meanes this libertie of yours be an occasion of falling, to them that are weake.
{8:10} For if any man see thee which hast knowledge, sit at meate in the idols temple: shal not the conscience of him which is weake, be boldened to eate those thinges which are offred to idols,
{8:11} And through thy knowledge shal the weake brother perishe, for whom Christe dyed?
{8:12} When ye sinne so against the brethren, and wounde their weake conscience, ye sinne against Christe.
{8:13} Wherefore, if meate offend my brother, I wyll eate no fleshe whyle the worlde standeth, lest I shoulde offende my brother.
{9:1} Am I not an Apostle? am I not free? haue I not seene Iesus Christe our Lord: Are ye not my worke in the Lorde?
{9:2} If I be not an Apostle vnto other, yet doubtlesse am I vnto you: For the seale of myne Apostleship are ye in the Lorde.
{9:3} Myne aunswere to them that aske me, is this,
{9:4} Haue we not power to eate and to drinke?
{9:5} Haue we not power to leade about a sister a woman as well as other Apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
{9:6} Either only I and Barnabas haue not power this to do?
{9:7} Who goeth a warfare any time at his owne cost? Who planteth a vineyarde, and eateth not of the fruite therof? Or who feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the milke of the flocke?
{9:8} Say I these thinges after the maner of men? or saith not the law the same also?
{9:9} For it is written in the law of Moyses: Thou shalt not moosell the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corne. Doth God take care for Oxen?
{9:10} Either sayth he it not altogether for our sakes? For our sakes no doubt this is written, that he which eareth, should eare in hope: & that he which tressheth in hope, should be partaker of his hope.
{9:11} If we haue sowen vnto you spirituall thinges, is it a great thing if we reape your carnall thinges?
{9:12} If others be partakers of this power wherfore are not we rather? Neuerthelesse, we haue not vsed this power: but suffer all thinges, lest we shoulde hinder the Gospel of Christ.
{9:13} Do ye not knowe that they which minister about holy thynges, eate of the thinges of the temple? And they whiche wayte at the aulter, are partakers with the aulter?
{9:14} Euen so hath the Lord ordayned, that they which preache the Gospell, shoulde lyue of the Gospell.
{9:15} But I haue vsed none of these thinges. Neuerthelesse, I wrote not these thinges, that it shoulde be so done vnto me: For it were better for me to die, then that any man should make my reioycing vayne.
{9:16} For if I preache the Gospell, I haue nothyng to reioyce of: for necessitie is layde vpon me. But wo is vnto me if I preache not the Gospell.
{9:17} For if I do it with a good wil, I haue a reward: but if I do it against my wil, the dispensatio is committed vnto me.
{9:18} What is my reward then? Uerily that when I preache the Gospell, I make the Gospell of Christ free, that I misuse not myne aucthoritie in the Gospell.
{9:19} For though I be free from all men, yet haue I made my selfe seruaunt vnto all men, that I might win the mo.
{9:20} Unto the Iewes, I become as a Iewe, that I might win the Iewes: To them that are vnder the lawe, I become as though I were vnder the lawe, that I might win them that are vnder the lawe:
{9:21} To them that are without lawe, become as though I were without lawe, (when I was not without law as parteyning to the lawe of God, but in the lawe of Christe) to winne them that are without lawe.
{9:22} To the weake became I as weake, that I might winne the weake. I am made all thinges to all men, that I might at the least way saue some.
{9:23} And this I do for the Gospels sake, that I might haue my part therof.
{9:24} Perceaue ye not howe that they which run in a race, run all, but one receaueth the rewarde? So run that ye may obtayne.
{9:25} Euery man that proueth maisteries, abstayneth from all thynges, and they do it to obtayne a crowne that shall perishe: but we to obtayne an euerlasting crowne.
{9:26} I therfore so run, not as at an vncertayne thing: So fight I, not as one that beateth the ayre.
{9:27} But I tame my body, and bryng it into subiection, lest by any meanes, that when I haue preached to other, I my selfe shoulde be a castaway.
{10:1} Brethre, I woulde not that ye shoulde be ignoraunt, howe that all our fathers were vnder the cloude, and all passed through the sea,
{10:2} And were all baptized vnto Moyses in the cloude, & in the sea:
{10:3} And dyd all eate of one spirituall meate.
{10:4} And dyd all drynke of one maner of spirituall drynke. (And they dranke of that spirituall rocke that folowed them, which rocke was Christe.)
{10:5} But in many of them had God no delite: For they were ouerthrowen in the wildernesse.
{10:6} These veryly are ensamples to vs, to thintent that we shoulde not lust after euyll thynges, as they also lusted.
{10:7} Neither be ye idolatours, as were some of them, as it is written: The people sate downe to eate and drynke, and rose vp to play.
{10:8} Neither let vs commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and fell in one daye three and thirtie thousande.
{10:9} Neither let vs tempt Christe, as some of them tempted, and were destroyed of serpentes.
{10:10} Neither murmure ye, as some of the also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.
{10:11} All these thinges happened vnto them for ensamples: but they are written to put vs in remembraunce, whom the endes of the worlde are come vpon.
{10:12} Wherfore, let hym that thynketh he standeth, take heede lest he fall.
{10:13} There hath no temptation taken you, but such as foloweth the nature of man: But God is faythfull, which shall not suffer you to be tempted aboue your strength: but shall with the temptation make away that ye maye be able to beare it.
{10:14} Wherfore my deare beloued, flee from idolatrie.
{10:15} I speake as vnto them which haue discretion, iudge ye what I say.
{10:16} The cuppe of blessyng which we blesse, is it not ye partakyng of the blood of Christe? The bread which we breake, is it not the partakyng of the body of Christe?
{10:17} For we that are many, are one bread and one body, in as much as we all are partakers of one bread.
{10:18} Beholde Israel after the fleshe. Are not they which eate of the sacrifices, partakers of the aulter?
{10:19} What say I then? that the idol is any thyng? Or that it which is offered to idols is any thyng?
{10:20} Nay but this I saye that the thinges which the gentiles offer, they offer to deuyls, & not to God. And I woulde not that ye shoulde haue felowshippe with the deuils.
{10:21} Ye can not drynke ye cup of the Lorde, and the cup of deuils. Ye can not be partakers of the Lordes table, and of the table of deuyls.
{10:22} Either do we prouoke the Lorde to anger? Are we stronger then he?
{10:23} All thynges are lawfull for me, but all thynges are not expedient: All thynges are lawfull for me, but all thynges edifie not.
{10:24} Let no man seeke his owne: but euery man anothers wealth.
{10:25} Whatsoeuer is solde in the market, that eate, and aske no question for conscience sake.
{10:26} For the earth is the Lordes, and all that therin is.
{10:27} If any of them which beleue not, byd you to a feast and ye be disposed to go, whatsoeuer is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.
{10:28} But yf any man say vnto you, this is offred vnto idols, eate not of it for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake. The earth is the Lordes and all that therin is.
{10:29} Conscience I say, not thyne, but of the other. For why is my libertie, iudged of another mans conscience?
{10:30} For, if I take my part with thankes, why am I euyll spoken of, for that wherfore I geue thankes?
{10:31} Whether therfore ye eate or drynke, or whatsoeuer ye do, do all to the prayse of God.
{10:32} See that ye geue none offence, neither to the Iewes, nor yet to the Grecians, neither to the Churche of God.
{10:33} Euen as I please all men in all thynges, not seking myne owne profite, but the profite of many, that they might be saued.
{11:1} Be ye the folowers of me, euen as I am of Christe.
{11:2} I commende you brethren, that ye remember me in all thinges, and kepe the ordinaunces, as I deliuered them to you.
{11:3} But I wyl that ye knowe, that Christ is the head of euery man. And the man is the womans head: And God is Christes head.
{11:4} Euery man praying or prophesiyng, hauyng any thing on his head, shameth his head.
{11:5} But euery woman that prayeth or prophesieth bare headed, dishonesteth her head: For that is euen all one as yf she were shauen.
{11:6} Yf the woman be not couered, let her also be shorne. Yf it be a shame for a woman to be shorne or shauen, let her couer her head.
{11:7} A man ought not to couer his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glorie of God: But the woman is the glorie of the man:
{11:8} For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man:
{11:9} Neither was the man created for the womans sake: but the woman for the mans sake.
{11:10} For this cause ought the woman to haue power on her head, for the Angels sakes.
{11:11} Neuerthelesse, neither is the man without the woman, neither ye woman without the man, in the Lorde.
{11:12} For as the woman is of the man, euen so is the man by the woman, but all of God.
{11:13} Iudge in your selues, whether it be comely that a woman pray vnto God bare headed?
{11:14} Doth not nature it selfe teache you, that it is a shame for a man, yf he haue long heere?
{11:15} But yf a woman haue long heere, it is a prayse for her: For her heere is geuen her to couer her withall.
{11:16} If any man lust to striue, we haue no such custome, neither the Churches of God.
{11:17} This I warne you of, and commende not, that ye come together, not after a better maner, but after a worse.
{11:18} For first of all, when ye come together in the Churche, I heare that there is dissention among you, and I partly beleue it.
{11:19} For there must be sectes among you, that they which are approued among you, myght be knowen.
{11:20} When ye come together therfore into one place, you can not eate the Lordes supper:
{11:21} For euery one preuenteth other, in eatyng his owne supper. And one is hungry, and another is drunken.
{11:22} Haue ye not houses to eate & to drynke in? Despise ye the Churche of God, and shame them that haue not? What shall I say vnto you, shall I prayse you in this, I prayse you not.
{11:23} That which I deliuered vnto you, I receaued of the Lorde. For the Lord Iesus, the same nyght in the which he was betrayed, toke bread:
{11:24} And when he had geuen thankes, he brake it, and sayde: Take ye and eate, this is my body which is broke for you: This do ye in the remembraunce of me.
{11:25} After the same maner also he toke the cup, when he had supped, saying: This cup is the newe testament in my blood: This do as oft as ye drynke it, in remembraunce of me.
{11:26} For as often as ye shal eate this bread, and drynke this cup, ye shall shewe the Lordes death tyll he come.
{11:27} Wherfore, whosoeuer shall eate this bread, and drynke this cup of the Lorde vnworthyly, shalbe gyltie of the body and blood of the Lorde.
{11:28} But let a man examine hym selfe, and so let hym eate of this bread, and drinke of this cuppe:
{11:29} For he that eateth and drynketh vnworthyly, eateth and drynketh his owne dampnation, because he maketh no difference of the Lordes body.
{11:30} For this cause many are weake and sicke among you, and many slepe.
{11:31} For yf we woulde iudge our selues, we shoulde not be iudged.
{11:32} But when we are iudged, we are chastened of the Lorde, that we shoulde not be dampned with the worlde.
{11:33} Wherfore my brethren, when ye come together to eate, tary one for another.
{11:34} If any man hunger, let hym eate at home, that ye come not together vnto condempnation. Other thynges wyll I set in order when I come.
{12:1} Concernyng spirituall gyftes, brethren, I woulde not haue you ignoraunt.
{12:2} Ye knowe yt ye were gentiles, and caryed away vnto dumbe idols, as ye were led.
{12:3} Wherfore I declare vnto you, that no man speakyng by the spirite of God, defieth Iesus. Also no man can say that Iesus is ye Lord, but by the holy ghost.
{12:4} There are diuersities of gyftes, but the spirite is one.
{12:5} And there are differences of administrations, but the Lorde is one.
{12:6} And there are diuers maners of operations, but God is one, which worketh all in all.
{12:7} The manifestation of the spirite, is geuen to euery man, to profite withall.
{12:8} For to one is geuen by the spirite, the worde of wisdome, to another the word of knowledge, by the same spirite:
{12:9} To another is geuen fayth, by the same spirite: to another the giftes of healyng by the same spirite:
{12:10} To another, power to do miracles, to another, prophesie, to another iudgement to discerne spirites, to another, diuers kyndes of tongues, to another, the interpretation of tongues.
{12:11} But these all worketh euen one and the selfe same spirite, deuidyng to euery man a seuerall gyft, as he wyll.
{12:12} For as the body is one, & hath many members, and all the members of one body, though they be many, yet are but one body: euen so is Christe.
{12:13} For by one spirite, are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Iewes or gentiles, whether we be bonde or free: and haue all drunke of one spirite.
{12:14} For the body is not one member, but many.
{12:15} If the foote woulde say, because I am not the hande, I am not of the body: is it therfore not of the body?
{12:16} And yf the eare woulde say, because I am not the eye, I am not of the body: is it therfore not of the body?
{12:17} If all the body were an eye, where were then the hearyng? If all were hearyng, where were the smellyng?
{12:18} But nowe hath God set ye members, euery one seuerally in the body, as it hath pleased hym.
{12:19} For yf they were all one member, where were the body?
{12:20} Nowe are there many members, yet but one body.
{12:21} And the eye can not say vnto ye hande, I haue no neede of thee: Nor, the head agayne to the feete, I haue no neede of you.
{12:22} Yea, rather a great deale, those members of the body which seeme to be more feeble, are necessary:
{12:23} And vpon those members of the body which we thynke least honest, put we more honestie on. And our vncomely partes, haue more comelynesse on.
{12:24} For our comely members neede it not: But God hath tempered the body together, and hath geuen the more honour to that part which lacked:
{12:25} Lest there shoulde be any stryfe in the body: but that the members shoulde haue the same care one for another.
{12:26} And yf one member suffer, all suffer with it. If one member be had in honour, all the members reioyce with it.
{12:27} Ye are the body of Christe, and members one of another.
{12:28} And God hath ordayned some in the Churche, first Apostles, secondarely, prophetes, thirdely teachers, then them that do miracles: after that, the giftes of healyng, helpers, gouernours, diuersitie of tongues.
{12:29} Are all, Apostles? are all, prophetes? are all, teachers?
{12:30} Are all, doers of miracles? Haue all the giftes of healyng? Do all speake with tongues? Do all interprete?
{12:31} Couet after the best giftes: And yet shew I vnto you a more excellent way.
{13:1} Though I speake with the tongues of men and of Angels, and haue not loue, I am as soundyng brasse, or as a tincklyng Cimball:
{13:2} And though I coulde prophesie, and vnderstoode all secretes, and all knowledge: Yea, if I had all fayth, so that I coulde moue mountaynes out of their places, and haue not loue, I were nothyng.
{13:3} And though I bestowe all my goodes to feede the poore, and though I geue my body that I burned, and haue not loue, it profiteth me nothyng.
{13:4} Loue suffreth long, and is curteous: Loue enuieth not, loue doth not frowardely, swelleth not,
{13:5} Dealeth not dishonestlie, seeketh not her owne, is not prouoked to anger, thynketh none euyll,
{13:6} Reioyceth not in iniquitie: bur reioyceth in the trueth:
{13:7} Suffreth all thynges, beleueth all thynges, hopeth all thynges, endureth all thynges.
{13:8} Though ye prophesiynges fayle, other tongues ceasse, or knowledge vanishe away, yet loue falleth neuer away.
{13:9} For our knowledge is vnperfect, and our prophesiyng is vnperfect:
{13:10} But when that which is perfect, is come, then that which is vnperfect shalbe done away.
{13:11} When I was a chylde, I spake as a childe, I vnderstode as a childe, I imagined as a chylde: But assoone as I was a man, I put away chyldishnesse.
{13:12} Nowe we see in a glasse, euen in a darke speakyng: but then shall we see face to face. Nowe I knowe vnperfectly: but then shall I knowe euen as I am knowen.
{13:13} Nowe abydeth fayth, hope, and loue, these three, but the chiefe of these is loue.
{14:1} Folowe after loue, and couet spirituall giftes but most chiefelie that ye may prophesie.
{14:2} For he that speaketh with the tongue, speaketh not vnto men, but vnto God: For no man heareth hym. Howbeit, in the spirite he speaketh misteries.
{14:3} But he that prophesieth, speaketh vnto men to their edifiyng, to their exhortation, and to their comfort.
{14:4} He that speaketh with the tongue, edifieth hym selfe: he that prophesieth, edifieth the Churche.
{14:5} I woulde yt ye al spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: For greater is he that prophesieth, then he that speaketh with tongues, except he expounde it, that the Churche may haue edifiyng.
{14:6} Nowe brethren, yf I come vnto you speakyng with tongues, what shall I profite you, except I speake to you eyther by reuelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesiyng, or by doctrine?
{14:7} Moreouer, thynges without lyfe geuing sound, whether it be a pipe or an harpe, except they make a distinction in the soundes, howe shall it be knowen what is piped or harped?
{14:8} And also yf the trumpe geue an vncertayne sounde, who shall prepare him selfe to the warre?
{14:9} Euen so lykewyse, when ye speake with tongues, except ye speake wordes that haue signification, howe shall it be vnderstande what is spoken? For ye shall speake into the ayer.
{14:10} There are so many kyndes of voyces, as it commeth to passe in the worlde, and none of them are without signification.
{14:11} If I knowe not what the voyce meaneth, I shalbe lyke vnto hym that speaketh, an aliaunt: and he that speaketh, shalbe an aliaunt vnto me.
{14:12} Euen so, forasmuch as ye couet spirituall giftes seke that ye may excell, vnto the edifiyng of the Churche.
{14:13} Wherfore, let him that speaketh with tongue, pray that he may interprete.
{14:14} For yf I pray with tongue, my spirite prayeth, but my vnderstanding is without fruite.
{14:15} What is it then? I wyll pray with the spirite, and wyll pray with the vnderstandyng also. I wyll syng with the spirite, and wyll syng with the vnderstandyng also.
{14:16} Els, when thou blessest with the spirite, howe shall he that occupieth the rowme of the vnlearned, say Amen at thy geuyng of thankes, seyng he vnderstandeth not what thou sayest?
{14:17} Thou veryly geuest thankes well: but the other is not edified.
{14:18} I thanke my God, I speake with tongues more the ye all.
{14:19} Yet had I rather, in the Churche to speake fiue wordes with my vnderstandyng, to the information of other, then ten thousande wordes with the tongue.
{14:20} Brethren, be not chyldren in wytte: Howbeit, as concerning maliciousnesse, be chyldren: but in wytte, be perfect.
{14:21} In the lawe it is written: With sundry tongues, and with sundry lyppes, wyll I speake vnto this people, and yet for all that will they not heare me, sayth the Lorde.
{14:22} Wherfore, tongues are for a signe, not to them that beleue, but to them that beleue not: But prophesiyng serueth not for them that beleue not, but for them which beleue.
{14:23} If therfore, when all the Churche is come together in one, & all speake with tongues, there come in they that are vnlearned, or they which beleue not: wyll they not say yt ye are out of your wittes?
{14:24} But yf all prophesie, and there come in one ye beleueth not, or one vnlearned: he is rebuked of all men, and is iudged of euery man:
{14:25} And so are the secretes of his heart made manifest, and so falleth he downe on his face, and worshippeth God, and sayth that God is in you of a trueth.
{14:26} Howe is it then brethren? When ye come together, euery one of you hath a psalme, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a reuelation, hath interpretation. Let all thynges be done vnto edifiyng.
{14:27} Yf any man speake with tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course, and let one interprete.
{14:28} But yf there be no interpreter, let him kepe scilence in the Churche, and let him speake to hym selfe, and to God.
{14:29} Let the prophetes speake two or three, and let the other iudge.
{14:30} If any reuelation be made to another that sitteth by, let ye first holde his peace.
{14:31} For ye may all prophesie one by one, that all may learne, and all may haue comfort.
{14:32} And the spirites of the prophetes, are subiect to the prophetes.
{14:33} For God is not the aucthour of confusion, but of peace, as in all Churches of the saintes.
{14:34} Let your women kepe scilence in the Churches: For it is not permitted vnto them to speake, but to be vnder obedience, as sayth the lawe.
{14:35} If they wyll learne any thyng, let the aske their husbandes at home: For it is a shame for women to speake in the Churche.
{14:36} Sproung the worde of God from you? Either came it vnto you only?
{14:37} If any man thynke hym selfe to be a prophete, either spiritual, let him knowe that the thinges that I write vnto you, are ye commaundementes of the Lorde.
{14:38} But yf any man be ignoraunt, let hym be ignoraunt.
{14:39} Wherfore brethren, couet to prophesie, and forbyd not to speake with tongues.
{14:40} Let all thynges be done honestlie and in order.
{15:1} Moreouer brethren I declare vnto you, the Gospell which I preached vnto you, which also ye haue receaued, and wherin ye cotinue,
{15:2} By the which also ye are saued, yf ye kepe in memorie after what maner I preached vnto you, except ye haue beleued in vayne.
{15:3} For first of all I deliuered vnto you, that which I receaued: howe that Christe dyed for our sinnes, agreeyng to the scriptures:
{15:4} And that he was buryed, and that he arose agayne the thirde day, accordyng to the scriptures:
{15:5} And that he was seene of Cephas, then of the twelue:
{15:6} After that, he was seene of mo then fiue hundred brethren at once: of which, many remayne vnto this day, & some are fallen a slepe.
{15:7} After that, he was seene of Iames, then of all the Apostles.
{15:8} And last of all he was seene of me, as of one borne out of due tyme.
{15:9} For I am the least of the Apostles, which am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Churche of God.
{15:10} But by the grace of God, I am that I am: And his grace which is in me, was not in vayne: But I laboured more aboundauntly then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which is with me.
{15:11} Therfore, whether it were I or they, so we preache, and so haue ye beleued.
{15:12} If Christe be preached howe that he rose from the dead: howe say some among you, that there is no resurrection of the dead?
{15:13} If there be no rysyng agayne of the dead, then is Christe not rysen agayne.
{15:14} If Christe be not rysen agayne, then is our preachyng vayne, and your fayth is also vayne.
{15:15} Yea, and we are founde false witnesses of God: For we haue testified of God, howe that he raysed vp Christe, whom he raysed not vp, yf it be so that the dead ryse not agayne.
{15:16} For yf the dead ryse not agayne, then is not Christe rysen agayne.
{15:17} If it be so, that Christ rose not againe, then is your fayth vayne, and ye are yet in your sinnes.
{15:18} Therfore, they which are fallen in a slepe in Christe, are perisshed.
{15:19} If in this lyfe only we haue hope on Christe, then are we of all men moste miserable.
{15:20} But nowe is Christe rysen from the dead, the first fruites of them that slept.
{15:21} For since by man came death, euen so by man came the resurrection of ye dead.
{15:22} For, as by Adam all dye: euen so by Christe shall all be made alyue,
{15:23} But euery man in his owne order. The first fruites is Christe, afterward, they that are Christes at his commyng.
{15:24} Then commeth the ende, when he hath deliuered vp the kingdome to God the father, when he hath put downe all rule, and all auctoritie, and power.
{15:25} For he must raigne tyll he haue put all his enemies vnder his feete.
{15:26} The last enemie that shalbe destroyed, is death.
{15:27} For he hath put downe all thynges vnder his feete: But when he saith, all thynges are vnder hym, it is manifest that he is excepted which dyd put all thynges vnder hym.
{15:28} When all thynges are subdued vnto hym, then shall the sonne also hym selfe be subiect vnto him that put all thinges vnder hym, that God may be all in all.
{15:29} Els what shall they do, which are baptized for the dead, yf the dead ryse not at all?
{15:30} Why are they then baptized for them? And why stande we in ieopardie euery houre?
{15:31} By our reioycyng which I haue in Christe Iesu our Lorde, I dye dayly.
{15:32} If I haue fought with beastes at Ephesus after the maner of men, what auauntageth it me, yf the dead ryse not agayne? Let vs eate & drynke, for to morowe we shall dye.
{15:33} Be not deceaued. Euyll wordes, corrupt good maners.
{15:34} Awake truely out of slepe, and sinne not: For some haue not the knowledge of God. I speake this to your shame.
{15:35} But some man wyll say, howe are the dead raysed vp? With what bodie shall they come?
{15:36} Thou foole, that which thou sowest, is not quickened except it dye.
{15:37} And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shalbe, but bare corne, as of wheate, or of some other:
{15:38} But God geueth it a body at his pleasure, to euery seede his owne body.
{15:39} All flesshe, is not the same flesshe: But there is one maner of flesshe of me, another flesshe of beastes, another of fisshes, and another of byrdes.
{15:40} There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: But the glorie of the celestial is one, and the glorie of the terrestrial another.
{15:41} There is another glorie of the sunne, and another glorie of the moone, and another glorie of the starres: For one starre differeth from another starre in glorie.
{15:42} So is the resurrection of the dead. It is sowen in corruption, it ryseth in incorruption.
{15:43} It is sowen in dishonour, it riseth in honour. It is sowen in weakenesse, it ryseth in power.
{15:44} It is sowen a naturall bodie, it ryseth a spirituall bodie. There is a naturall bodie, and there is a spirituall bodie.
{15:45} As it is also written: The first man Adam was made a lyuyng soule, and the last Adam was made a quickenyng spirite.
{15:46} Howebeit, that is not first whiche is spirituall, but that whiche is naturall, and then that whiche is spirituall.
{15:47} The first man is of the earth, earthy: the seconde man is the Lorde from heauen.
{15:48} As is the earthy, suche are they that are earthy: And as is the heauenly, such are they also that are heauenly.
{15:49} And as we haue borne the image of the earthy, so shall we beare the image of the heauenly.
{15:50} This saye I brethren, that fleshe and blood can not inherite the kyngdome of God: Neither doth corruption, inherite incorruption.
{15:51} Beholde, I shewe you a misterie. We shall not all slepe: but we shall all be chaunged.
{15:52} In a moment, in the twynklyng of an eye, at the last trumpe. For the trumpe shall blowe, and the dead shall ryse incorruptible, and we shalbe chaunged.
{15:53} For this corruptible, must put on incorruption, and this mortall must put on immortalitie.
{15:54} When this corruptible, hath put on incorruption, and this mortal, hath put on immortalitie, then shalbe brought to passe the saying that is written, Death is swalowed vp into victorie.
{15:55} O death where is thy stynge? O hell where is thy victorie?
