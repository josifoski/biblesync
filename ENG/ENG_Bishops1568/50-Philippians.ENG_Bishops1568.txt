{1:1} Paul & Timotheus the seruauntes of Iesus Christ: To all the saintes in Christ Iesus, whiche are at Philippos, with the bisshops & deacons:
{1:2} Grace be vnto you, and peace fro God our father, and from the Lorde Iesus Christ.
{1:3} I thanke my God, with all remembraunce of you,
{1:4} ( Alwayes in all my prayer for all you, makyng prayer with gladnesse,)
{1:5} For your felowship in the Gospell, fro the first day vntyll nowe.
{1:6} And beyng perswaded of this same thyng, that he which hath begun good worke in you, wyll perfourme it vntyll the day of Iesus Christe,
{1:7} As it becommeth me to iudge this of you al, because I haue you in my heart, and in my bondes, in the defence and confirmation of the Gospell, you all beyng partakers of my grace.
{1:8} For God is my recorde howe greatly I long after you all, in the bowels of Iesus Christe.
{1:9} And this I pray, that your loue may abounde yet more and more in knowledge, and in all vnderstandyng:
{1:10} That ye maye discerne thynges that differ, that ye maye be pure, and without offence, tyll the day of Christe.
{1:11} Beyng fylled with the fruites of righteousnesse, which are by Iesus Christ, vnto the glorie and prayse of God.
{1:12} But I woulde ye should vnderstande brethren, that the thinges which came vnto me, hath come rather vnto the furtheraunce of the Gospell:
{1:13} So that my bondes in Christe, are manifest, throughout all the iudgement hall, and in all other places.
{1:14} And many of the brethren of the Lord, beyng incouraged through my bondes, dare more plentifully speake the word, without feare.
{1:15} Some preache Christe of enuie & strife, and some of good wyll.
{1:16} The one preache Christe of strife, not sincerely, supposyng to adde more affliction to my bondes:
{1:17} But the others of loue, knowing that I am set to the defence of the Gospell.
{1:18} What then? So that Christe be preached any maner of way, whether it be by pretence, or by trueth, I ioy therein, and wyll ioy.
{1:19} For I knowe that this shall turne to my saluation, through your prayer, and ministryng of the spirite of Iesus Christe,
{1:20} Accordyng to my expectation, and my hope, yt in nothyng I shalbe ashamed: but yt with all boldnesse, as alwayes, so now also, Christ shalbe magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.
{1:21} For Christe is to me lyfe, and death is to me aduantage.
{1:22} But if I lyue in the fleshe, this (is) the fruite of my labour, and what I shall chose, I wote not.
{1:23} For I am in a strayte betwixt two, hauyng a desire to be loosed, and to be with Christ, which is much farre better.
{1:24} Neuerthelesse, to abyde in ye fleshe, is more needefull for you.
{1:25} And this am I sure of, that I shall abyde & continue with you all, for your furtheraunce and ioy of fayth,
{1:26} That your reioysyng may be ye more aboundaunt in Iesus Christe for me, by my commyng to you agayne.
{1:27} Only let your conuersation be, as it becommeth the Gospell of Christe: that whether I come and set you, or els be absent, I may yet heare of your matters, that ye continue in one spirite, in one soule, fyghtyng together for ye fayth of the Gospell.
{1:28} And in nothyng fearyng your aduersaries, which is to them a token of perdition: but to you of saluatio, and that of God.
{1:29} For vnto you it is geuen for Christe, not only this to beleue on hym: but also this, to suffer for his sake,
{1:30} Hauing the same fight, which ye sawe in me, and nowe heare in me.
{2:1} If there be therefore any consolation in Christe, yf any comfort of loue, if any felowship of ye spirite, yf any compassion and mercie,
{2:2} Fulfyl ye my ioy, that ye be lyke mynded, hauyng the same loue, being of one accorde, of one mynde,
{2:3} Let nothyng be done through stryfe or vayne glorie, but in mekenesse of mynde euery man esteeme one ye other better then hym selfe.
{2:4} Loke not euery man on his owne thynges, but euery man also on the thynges of others.
{2:5} Let ye same mynde be in you, which was in Christe Iesus:
{2:6} Who beyng in the fourme of God, thought it not robbery to be equall with God.
{2:7} But made hym selfe of no reputation, takyng on him the fourme of a seruaut, and made in the lykenesse of men, and founde in figure as a man:
{2:8} He humbled hym selfe, made obedient vnto death, euen the death of the crosse.
{2:9} Wherfore God also hath highly exalted hym, and geuen hym a name which is aboue euery name.
{2:10} That in the name of Iesus euery knee should bowe, of thynges in heauen, and thynges in earth, and thinges vnder the earth:
{2:11} And that euery tongue should confesse that the Lorde, Iesus Christe is to the glorie of God the father.
{2:12} Wherfore, my dearely beloued, as ye haue alwayes obeyed, not as in my presence only, but nowe much more in my absence, worke out your owne saluation with feare and tremblyng.
{2:13} For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of good wyll.
{2:14} Do all thyng without murmuryng and disputyng:
{2:15} That ye may be blamelesse and pure, the sonnes of God, without rebuke in the myddes of a croked and peruerse nation, among who shyne ye as lightes in the worlde,
{2:16} Holdyng fast the worde of lyfe, to my reioycyng in the day of Christe that I haue not runne in vayne, neither haue laboured in vayne.
{2:17} Yea, and though I be offered vp vpo the offeryng and seruice of your fayth, I reioyce, and reioyce with you all.
{2:18} For the same cause also do ye reioyce, and reioyce with me.
{2:19} But I trust in the Lorde Iesus, to sende Timotheus shortly vnto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I knowe your state.
{2:20} For I haue no man lyke mynded, who wyll naturally care for your state.
{2:21} For all seeke their owne, not the thynges which are Iesus Christes.
{2:22} Ye knowe the profe of hym, that as a sonne with the father, he hath serued with me in the Gospell.
{2:23} Hym therfore I hope to sende, assoone as I knowe my state.
{2:24} But I trust in the Lorde, that I also my selfe shall come shortly.
{2:25} But I supposed it necessarie to sende to you Epaphroditus, my brother and companion in labour, & felowe souldier, but your Apostle, and the minister of my neede.
{2:26} For he longed after you all, and was full of heauinesse, because that ye had hearde that he had ben sicke.
{2:27} And no doubt he was sicke nye vnto death, but God had mercie on hym, and not on hym only, but on me also, lest I shoulde haue sorowe vpon sorowe.
{2:28} I sent him therfore the more diligentlie, that when ye see him againe, ye may reioyce, and that I may be the lesse sorowfull.
{2:29} Receaue hym therfore in the Lorde with all gladnes, & make much of such:
{2:30} Because, for the worke of Christe, he was nye vnto death, not regardyng his lyfe, to fulfyll your lacke of seruice towarde me.
{3:1} Moreouer my brethren, reioyce ye in the Lord. It greeueth me not to write the same thyng often to you, for to you it is a sure thyng.
{3:2} Beware of dogges, beware of euyll workers, beware of concision.
{3:3} For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirite, and reioyce in Christ Iesus, and haue no confidence in the fleshe:
{3:4} Though I might also haue confidence in the fleshe. If any other man thinketh that he hath wherof he myght trust in the fleshe, more I:
{3:5} Circumcised the eyght day, of the kinred of Israel, of the tribe of Beniamin, an Ebrue of the Ebrues, after the lawe a pharisee,
{3:6} Concernyng feruentnesse, persecutyng the Churche: touchyng ye righteousnesse which is in ye lawe, I was blamelesse.
{3:7} But the thynges that were vauntage vnto me, those I counted losse for Christes sake.
{3:8} Yea, I thynke all thynges but losse, for the excellencie of the knowledge of Christe Iesus my Lorde: For whom I haue counted all thyng losse, & do iudge the but vile, that I may winne Christe,
{3:9} And be founde in hym, not hauyng myne owne ryghteousnesse which is of the lawe: but that which is through the fayth of Christ, the ryghteousnes which commeth of God through fayth:
{3:10} That I may knowe hym, and the power of his resurrection, and the felowshippe of his passions, confirmable vnto his death,
{3:11} If by any meanes, I myght attayne vnto the resurrection of the dead.
{3:12} Not as though I had alredy attayned, either were alredy perfect: but I folowe, yf that I may comprehende, wherein also I am comprehended of Christe Iesus.
{3:13} Brethren I count not my selfe as yet that I haue attained: but this one thing I say I forget those thinges which are behynde, and endeuour my selfe vnto those thynges which are before,
{3:14} And I prease towarde the marke, for the price of the hye callyng of God in Christe Iesus.
{3:15} Let vs therfore as many as be perfect, be thus mynded, and if ye be otherwyse mynded, God shall reueale the same also vnto you.
{3:16} Neuerthelesse, vnto that which we haue attayned vnto, let vs proceade by one rule, that we may be of one accorde.
{3:17} Brethren, be folowers together of me, and loke on them which walke so as ye haue vs for an ensample.
{3:18} For many walke, of whom I haue tolde you often, & nowe tel you wepyng, that they are the enemies of the crosse of Christe:
{3:19} Whose ende is dampnation, whose God is their belly, and glorie to their shame, which mynde earthly thynges.
{3:20} But our conuersation is in heauen, from whence also we loke for the sauiour, the Lorde Iesus Christe:
{3:21} Who shall chaunge our vyle body, that it may be fashioned lyke vnto his glorious body, according to the working wherby he is able to subdue all thynges vnto hym selfe.
{4:1} Therfore my brethren beloued & longed for, my ioy and crowne, so continue in the Lorde ye beloued.
{4:2} I pray Euodias, and beseche Syntyches, yt they be of one accorde in the Lorde.
{4:3} Yea, and I beseche thee also faythfull yockefelowe, helpe those women which laboured with me in the Gospell, and with Clement also, and with other my labour felowes, whose names are in the booke of lyfe.
{4:4} Reioyce in the Lorde alway, and agayne I say reioyce.
{4:5} Let your pacient mynde be knowen vnto all men: The Lorde is at hande.
{4:6} Be carefull for nothyng: but in all thynges, let your petition be manifest vnto God, in prayer and supplication with geuyng of thankes.
{4:7} And the peace of God, which passeth all vnderstandyng, shall kepe your heartes and myndes through Christe Iesus.
{4:8} Furthermore brethren, whatsoeuer, thynges are true, whatsoeuer thynges (are) honest, whatsoeuer thynges (are) iuste, whatsoeuer thynges (are) pure, whatsoeuer thynges pertayne to loue, whatsoeuer thynges (are) of honest report: If there be any vertue, & yf there be any prayse, thynke on these thynges:
{4:9} Which ye haue both learned, and receaued, and hearde, and seene in me: Those thinges do, and the God of peace shalbe with you.
{4:10} But I reioyce in the Lorde greatly, that nowe at the last you are reuiued againe to care for me, in ye wherin ye were also carefull, but ye lacked oportunitie.
{4:11} I speake not because of necessitie. For I haue learned, in whatsoeuer estate I am, therwith to be content.
{4:12} I knowe howe to be lowe, and I knowe howe to exceade. Euery where & in all thynges I am instructed, both to be ful, and to be hungry, both to haue plentie, and to suffer neede.
{4:13} I can do all thynges through Christe, which strengtheneth me.
{4:14} Notwithstandyng, ye haue well done yt ye dyd communicate to my afflictions.
{4:15} Ye Philippians knowe also, that in the begynnyng of the Gospell, when I departed fro Macedonia, no Church communicated to me, as concernyng geuyng and receauyng, but ye only.
{4:16} For euen in Thessalonica, ye sent once, & afterward agayne vnto my necessitie.
{4:17} Not that I desire a gyft, but I desire fruite aboundyng to your accompt.
{4:18} But I haue receaued al, & haue plentie. I was euen fylled after that I had receaued of Epaphroditus the thynges which were sent from you, an odoure of a sweete smel, a sacrifice acceptable, plesaunt to God.
{4:19} My God shall supplie all your neede, through his riches in glorie, in Christe Iesus.
{4:20} Unto God and our father, be prayse for euermore. Amen.
{4:21} Salute all the saintes in Christe Iesus. The brethren which are with me, greete you.
{4:22} All the saintes salute you, most of all, they that are of Caesars housholde.
{4:23} The grace of our Lorde Iesu Christe be with you all. Amen. This Epistle was written from Rome, by Epaphroditus.
