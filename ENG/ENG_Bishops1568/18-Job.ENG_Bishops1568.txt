{1:1} In the lande of Hus there was a man whose name was Iob, & the same was a perfect and iust man, one that feared God and eschued euill.
{1:2} And he had seuen sonnes and three daughters.
{1:3} His substaunce also was seuen thousand sheepe, and three thousand camels, fiue hundred yoke of oxen, and fiue hundred shee asses, and a very great householde: so that he was one of the most principall men among all them of the east countrey.
{1:4} And his sonnes went and banquetted in their houses euery one his day, and sent for their three sisters to eate and drinke with them.
{1:5} And when the dayes of their banquetting were gone about, Iob sent and sanctified them, and gat vp early and offered for euery one a burnt offring: For Iob saide, It may be that my sonnes haue done some offence, & haue ben vnthankfull to God in their heartes. Thus did Iob euery day.
{1:6} And vpon a day when the children of God came and stoode before the lord, Satan came also among them.
{1:7} And the Lorde saide vnto Satan Whence comest thou? Satan aunswered the Lorde and saide: From compassing the earth to and fro, & from walking through it.
{1:8} And the Lorde saide vnto Satan: Hast thou not considered my seruaunt Iob, how there is none lyke him in the earth? a perfect and a iust man, one that feareth God, and eschueth euill?
{1:9} Satan aunswered, and saide vnto the Lorde: Doth Iob feare God for naught?
{1:10} Hast thou not preserued him and his house, and al that he hath on euery side? Thou hast blessed the worke of his handes, and his possession is encreased in the lande.
{1:11} But laye thyne hand now vpon him, and touche all that he hath, and he shall curse thee to thy face.
{1:12} And the Lorde saide vnto Satan: Lo, all that he hath be in thy power, only vpon him selfe see that thou lay not thine hand. And Satan went foorth from the presence of the Lorde.
{1:13} And vpon a certayne day, when his sonnes and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house,
{1:14} There came a messenger vnto Iob, and sayde: The oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them:
{1:15} And the Sabees came violently, and toke them away, yea they haue slayne thy seruauntes with the edge of the sword: and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
{1:16} While he was yet speaking, there came another, and sayde: The fire of God is fallen from heauen, and hath brent vp thy sheepe and seruauntes, and consumed them: and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
{1:17} And whyle he was yet speaking there came another, and sayde: The Caldees made out their bandes, and fel vpon the camels, and haue caried them away, yea and slayne thy seruauntes with the sworde: and I only am gotten away alone to tell thee.
{1:18} And whyle he was yet speaking there came an other, and sayde: Thy sonnes and thy daughters were eating and drincking wine in their eldest brothers house,
{1:19} And behold there came a mightie great wind from beyond the wildernesse, and smote the foure corners of the house, whiche fell vpon thy children, and they are dead: and I am gotten away alone to tell thee.
{1:20} Then Iob stoode vp, and rent his clothes, & shaued his head, fell downe vpon the ground, worshipped,
{1:21} And sayde: Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, & naked shall I turne thyther againe: The Lorde gaue & the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of the Lorde.
{1:22} In all these thinges dyd Iob not offende, nor charged God foolishly.
{2:1} And on a day the children of God came and stoode before the Lorde, and Satan came also among the, and stoode before the Lorde.
{2:2} And the Lorde sayde vnto Satan: From whence commest thou? Satan aunswered the Lorde, and sayd: I haue gone about the lande, walked thorow it.
{2:3} And the Lorde sayde vnto Satan: Hast thou not considered my seruaunt Iob? howe there is none like vnto hym in the earth, a perfect and a iust man? one that feareth God, and eschueth euil, & continueth still in his vprightnesse, although thou mouedst me against hym, to destroy him without cause.
{2:4} And Satan aunswered the Lord, and sayd, Skinne for skinne, yea a man wil geue al that euer he hath for his life.
{2:5} But lay thyne hande nowe vpon hym, and touch once his bone and his fleshe, and he shall curse thee to thy face.
{2:6} And the Lord sayde vnto Satan: Lo, he is in thyne hand, but saue his lyfe.
{2:7} So went Satan foorth from the presence of the Lorde, and smote Iob with sore byles, from the sole of his foote vnto his crowne.
{2:8} And he toke a potsharde to scrape hym: and he sat downe among the asshes.
{2:9} Then sayd his wyfe vnto him: Doest thou continue yet in thy perfectnesse? curse God, and dye.
{2:10} But he sayde vnto her, Thou speakest like a foolish woman: shal we receaue good at the hande of God, and not receaue euyll? In all these thinges did not Iob sinne with his lippes.
{2:11} Nowe when Iobs three friendes heard of all the trouble that came vpon him, they came euery one fro his owne place namely Eliphas the Themanite, Bildad the Suhite, and Zophad the Naamathite: for they were agreed together to come to shewe their compassion vpon him, and to comfort hym.
{2:12} So when they lift vp their eyes a farre of, they knew him not: then they cryed and wept, and euery one of them rent his clothes, and sprinckled dust vpon their heades in the ayre.
{2:13} They sate them downe by him also vpon the grounde seuen dayes & seuen nightes, and none spake a worde vnto him: for they sawe that his greefe was very great.
{3:1} After this opened Iob his mouth, and cursed his day,
{3:2} And Iob aunswered, and sayde:
{3:3} Let the day perishe wherin I was borne, and the night in the whiche it was sayd, There is a man childe conceaued.
{3:4} The same day be turned to darknesse, and not regarded of God from aboue, neither let the light shyne vpon it:
{3:5} But let it be stayned with darknesse and the shadowe of death, let the dimme cloude fall vpon it, whiche may make it terrible as a most bitter day.
{3:6} Let the darke storme ouercome that night, and let it not be ioyned vnto the dayes of the yere, nor counted in the number of the monethes.
{3:7} Desolate be that night, and without gladnesse.
{3:8} Let them that curse the day, and that be redy to rayse vp mourning, geue it also their curse.
{3:9} Let the starres of that night be dimme thorowe darkenesse of it, let it loke for light, but haue none, neither let it see the dawning of the day:
{3:10} Because it shut not vp the doores of my mothers wombe, nor hyd sorowe from myne eyes.
{3:11} Alas why died I not in the birth? why dyd not I perishe assoone as I came out of my mothers wombe?
{3:12} Why set they me vpon their knees? why gaue they me sucke with their brestes?
{3:13} Then should I nowe haue lyen stil, I shoulde haue slept, and ben at rest,
{3:14} Lyke as the kinges and lordes of the earth, which haue buylded them selues speciall places,
{3:15} Or as the princes that haue had golde, and their houses full of siluer:
{3:16} Or why was not I hyd, as a thing borne out of tune, either as young children which neuer sawe the light?
{3:17} There must the wicked ceasse from their tyrannie, and there such as laboured valiauntly be at rest:
{3:18} There the prisoners rest together, they heare no more the voyce of the oppressour:
{3:19} There are small and great, and the seruaunt is free from his maister.
{3:20} Wherefore is the light geuen to hym that is in miserie? & lyfe vnto them that haue heauy heartes?
{3:21} Whiche long for death and finde it not, though they search more for it than for treasures:
{3:22} Which reioyce exceedingly, and be glad when they can finde the graue,
{3:23} From whom their endes are hyd, and consealed by God?
{3:24} For my sighes come before I eate, and my roringes are powred out like the water:
{3:25} For the thing that I feared is come vpon me, and the thing that I was afrayde of is happened vnto me,
{3:26} Was I not happy? Had I not quietnesse? Was I not in rest? And nowe commeth such miserie vpon me.
{4:1} And Eliphas the Themanite aunswered, & sayde:
{4:2} If we assay to come with thee, wilt thou be discontent? But who can withhold him selfe from speaking?
{4:3} Beholde, thou hast ben an instructer of many, & hast strenghtned the weery handes:
{4:4} Thy wordes haue set vp him that was falling, thou hast refreshed the weake knees.
{4:5} But nowe it is come vpon thee, and thou art greeued: it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
{4:6} Was not thy feare according to thy hope? and the perfectnesse of thy wayes according to thy expectation?
{4:7} Consider I pray thee who euer perished beyng an innocent? or when were the godly destroyed?
{4:8} For as I haue proued by experience, they that plow iniquitie & sow wretchednesse, reape the same.
{4:9} With the blast of God they perishe, with the breath of his nostrels are they consumed away.
{4:10} The roring of the lion, and the voyce of the lion, and the teeth of the lions whelpes are pulled out.
{4:11} The lion perisheth for lake of pray, & the lions whelpes are scattered abrode.
{4:12} But wheras a thing was hyd from me, yet myne care hath receaued a litle therof.
{4:13} In the thoughtes and visions of the night when sleepe commeth on men,
{4:14} Feare came vpon me & dread, which made all my bones to shake.
{4:15} The winde passed by before my presence, and made the heeres of my fleshe to stande vp.
{4:16} He stoode thereon and I knewe not his face, an image there was before myne eyes, and in the stilnesse hearde I a voyce.
{4:17} Shall man be more iust then God? or shall a man be purer then his maker?
{4:18} Beholde, he founde not trueth in his seruauntes, and in his angels there was folly:
{4:19} Howe much more in them that dwel in houses of clay, and whose foundation is but dust, which shall be consumed as it were with a moth?
{4:20} They shalbe smitten from the morning vnto the euening: yea they shall perishe for euer, when no man regardeth them.
{4:21} Is not their royaltie gone away with them? they shall dye truely, and not in wysdome.
{5:1} Crye I pray thee, if there be any that will aunswere thee, & loke thou vpon any of the holy.
{5:2} As for the foolish ma, wrathfulnesse killeth him, and enuie slayeth the ignorant.
{5:3} I haue seene my selfe when the foolish was deepe rooted, and sodenly I cursed his habitation.
{5:4} His children were without prosperitie, and they were slayne in the gate, and there was no man to deliuer them.
{5:5} His haruest was eaten of the hungrie, & taken from among the thornes, and the thurstie drunke vp their labour: It is not the earth that bringeth foorth iniquitie,
{5:6} Neither commeth sorowe out of the ground:
{5:7} But man is borne vnto labour, like as the sparkes flee vp out of the hot coles,
{5:8} But I woulde aske counsell at the Lorde, and talke with God?
{5:9} Whiche doth great thinges and vnsearcheable, and maruels without number.
{5:10} He geueth rayne vpon the earth, and powreth water vpon the streetes,
{5:11} To set vp them that be of lowe degree, and that those which are in heauinesse may be exalted to saluation.
{5:12} He destroyeth the deuices of the subtyll, so that their handes are not able to perfourme that which they do enterprise.
{5:13} He compasseth the wise in their owne craftinesse, & maketh foolishe the counsell of the wicked.
{5:14} They runne into darknesse by fayre day, and grope at the noone day as in the night.
{5:15} But he deliuereth the poore from the sworde, from their threatninges, and from the violence of the mightie.
{5:16} He is the hope of the poore, & the mouth of the wicked shalbe stopped.
{5:17} Behold, blessed is the man whom God correcteth, therefore refuse not thou the chastening of the almightie:
{5:18} For be maketh a wounde and he healeth: he smiteth, and his hande maketh whole againe.
{5:19} He shall deliuer thee in sixe troubles, & in the seuenth there shall no euil come to thee.
{5:20} In hunger he shall saue thee from death, and when it is warre, from the power of the sworde.
{5:21} Thou shalt be hyd from the scourge of the tongue, & when destruction commeth thou shalt not neede to feare.
{5:22} In destruction and dearth thou shalt be mery, and shalt not be afrayde of the beastes of the earth.
{5:23} For the stones of the land shalbe confederate with thee, and the beastes of the fielde shalbe at peace with thee.
{5:24} And thou shalt knowe that thy dwelling place shalbe in rest, and thou shalt visite thy habitation, & shalt not sinne.
{5:25} Thou shalt see also that thy seede shall be great, and thy posteritie as the grasse vpon the earth.
{5:26} Thou shalt come also to thy graue in a full age, like a corne sheafe cut downe in due season.
{5:27} Lo, this we our selues haue proued by experience, and euen thus it is: Hearken thou to it also, that thou mayest take heede to thy selfe.
{6:1} But Iob aunswered, and sayde:
{6:2} O that my complaynt were truely wayed, and my punishment layde in the balaunces together:
{6:3} For nowe it woulde be heauier then the sande of the sea: and this is the cause, that my wordes fayle me.
{6:4} For the arrowes of the almightie are vpon me, the poyson therof hath drunke vp my spirite, and the terrible feares of God are set against me.
{6:5} Doth the wild asse rore when he hath grasse? or loweth the oxe when he hath fodder inough
{6:6} That which is vnsauerie, shall it be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the whyte of an egge?
{6:7} The thinges that sometime I might not away withel, are nowe my meate for very sorowe.
{6:8} O that I might haue my desire, and that God woulde graunt me the thing that I long for:
{6:9} O that God would begin and smite me, that he would let his hand go and take me cleane away:
{6:10} Then shoulde I haue some comfort, yea I woulde desire him in my payne that he would not spare, for I wil not be against the wordes of the holy one.
{6:11} For what powre haue I to endure? And what is myne end, that my soule might be patient?
{6:12} Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my fleshe of brasse?
{6:13} Is it not so that there is in me no helpe? & that my substaunce is taken from me?
{6:14} He that is in tribulation, ought to be comforted of his neyghbour: but the feare of the almightie is cleane away.
{6:15} Myne owne brethren passe ouer by me as the water brooke, & as the ouerflowing of waters, whiche do hastly go away,
{6:16} Whiche are blackish be reason of the ice, and wherin the snowe is hyd.
{6:17} Which when they haue passed by do vanishe, and when the heate commeth they fayle out of their place.
{6:18} They depart from the course of their wonted chanell to other places, they runne in vayne and perishe.
{6:19} They that went to The man considered them, and they that went to Saba wayted for them.
{6:20} But they were confounded in their hope, they came thyther and were ashamed.
{6:21} Euen such truely are ye, nowe that ye see my miserie ye are afrayde.
{6:22} Did I desire you to bring vnto me, or to geue me any of your substaunce?
{6:23} To deliuer me from the enemies hand, or to saue me from the hande of the tyrauntes?
{6:24} Teache me, and I will hold my tong: and wherin I haue erred; cause me to vnderstande.
{6:25} How strong are the wordes of trueth? and which of you can rebuke or reproue them?
{6:26} Do ye imagine to reproue wordes, that the talke of the afflicted shoulde be as the winde?
{6:27} Ye fall vpon the fatherlesse, and digge a pit to ouerthrowe your owne frende.
{6:28} And therfore be content, & loke now vpon me, and I will not lye before your face.
{6:29} Turne I pray you, be indifferent iudges: turne agayne, and ye shall see myne vngiltinesse,
{6:30} (6:29) whether there be any vnrighteousnes in my tongue, or vayne wordes in my mouth.
{7:1} Is ther not an appoynted time to man vpon earth? Are not his dayes also like the dayes of an hired seruaunt?
{7:2} For like as a bonde seruaunt desireth the shadowe, and as an hyreling woulde fayne haue the rewarde of his worke:
{7:3} Euen so haue I laboured whole monethes long in vayne, and many a carefull night haue I tolde.
{7:4} When I layde me downe to sleepe, I sayde, O when shall I arise? and measuring the euening, I am euen full with tossing to and fro vnto the dawning of the day.
{7:5} My fleshe is clothed with wormes and dust of the earth: my skinne is withered and become horrible.
{7:6} My dayes passe ouer more spedyly then a weauers shuttle, and are spent without hope.
{7:7} O remember that my lyfe is but a winde, and that myne eye shall no more see pleasures:
{7:8} Yea and the eye that hath seene me, shal see me no more: for yer thou fasten thyne eye vpon me, I come to naught.
{7:9} The cloude is consumed and vanished away: so he that goeth downe to the graue shall come no more vp,
{7:10} Nor turne againe into his house, neither shall his place knowe him any more.
{7:11} Therfore I wil not spare my mouth, but I will speake in the trouble of my spirite, and muse in the bitternesse of my mynde.
{7:12} Am I a sea or a whale fish, that thou kepest me so in prison?
{7:13} When I say, My bed shal comfort me, I shall haue some refreshing by talking to my selfe vpon my couch:
{7:14} Then fearest thou me with dreames, & makest me so afrayde through visions,
{7:15} That my soule wisheth rather to perishe and die, then my bones to remayne.
{7:16} I can see no remedy, I shall liue no more: O spare me then, for my dayes are but vanitie.
{7:17} What is man that thou doest magnifie him? and that thou settest thy heart vpon him?
{7:18} Thou visitest him early and euery day, euery moment doest thou trie him.
{7:19} Why goest thou not fro me, nor lettest me alone, so long till I may swalowe downe my spyttle?
{7:20} I haue offended, what shall I do vnto the, O thou preseruer of men? Why hast thou set me as a marke against thee, so that I am a burden to my selfe?
{7:21} Why doest thou not pardon my trespasses, and take away myne iniquitie? Behold, nowe must I sleepe in the dust, and if thou sekest me to morowe in the morning, I shal not be.
{8:1} Then aunswered Bildad the Suhite, & said:
{8:2} Howe long wilt thou talke of such thinges? howe long shall the wordes of thy mouth be as a mightie wind?
{8:3} Doth God paruert the thing that is lawfull? or doth the almightie destroy the thing that is right?
{8:4} For seyng that thy sonnes sinned against him, did not he send them into the place of their iniquitie?
{8:5} If thou wouldest nowe resorte vnto God be times, and make thy prayer to the almightie,
{8:6} If thou wouldest liue a pure and godly life: shoulde he not awake vp vnto thee immediatly, and make the habitation of thy righteousnesse prosperous?
{8:7} In so much that wherin so euer thou haddest litle afore, thou shouldest haue nowe great aboundaunce.
{8:8} Enquire I pray thee of the former age, and search diligently among their fathers:
{8:9} (For we are but of yesterday, and consider not that our dayes vpon earth are but a shadowe.)
{8:10} Shall not they shew thee, and tel thee, yea and gladly confesse the same, and vtter the wordes of their heart?
{8:11} May a rushe be greene without moystnesse? or may the grasse growe without water?
{8:12} No, but whilste it is nowe in his greennesse, though it be not cut downe, yet withereth it before any other hearbe:
{8:13} So are the pathes of al that forget God, and the hypocrites hope shall come to naught.
{8:14} His confidence shalbe destroyed, and his trust shalbe a spiders webbe.
{8:15} He shal leane vpon his house, but it shal not stande: he shall holde him fast by it, yet shall it not endure.
{8:16} It is a greene tree before the sunne, & shooteth foorth the braunches ouer his garden.
{8:17} The rootes thereof are wrapped about the fountayne, and are folden about the house of stones.
{8:18} If any plucke it from his place, and it denie, saying, I haue not seene thee:
{8:19} Behold it will reioyce by this meanes, if it may growe in another mould.
{8:20} Beholde, God will not cast away a vertuous man, neither wil he helpe the vngodly.
{8:21} Thy mouth shall he fill with laughing, and thy lippes with gladnesse.
{8:22} They also that hate thee shalbe clothed with shame, & the dwelling of the vngodly shall come to naught.
{9:1} Iob aunswered, and sayde,
{9:2} I knowe it is so of a trueth: For how may a man compared vnto God be iustified?
{9:3} If he wil argue with hym, he can not aunswere hym one thing of a thousande.
{9:4} He is wyse in heart and mightie in strength: who hath ben fearce against hym, and hath prospered?
{9:5} He translateth the mountaynes, or euer they be aware it is he that ouerthroweth them in his wrath.
{9:6} He remoueth the earth out of her place, that the pillers therof shake withall.
{9:7} He commaundeth the sunne, and it ryseth not: he closeth vp the starres as vnder a signet.
{9:8} He hym selfe alone spreadeth out the heauens, and goeth vpon the waues of the sea.
{9:9} He maketh the Waynes of heauen, the Orion, the seuen starres, and the secret places of the south.
{9:10} He doth great thinges & vnsearcheable, yea and wonders without number.
{9:11} Lo, when he goeth by me, I shal not see hym, and when he passeth, I shall not perceaue hym.
{9:12} If he be hastie to take away, who wil make him restore it? or who will say vnto hym, what doest thou?
{9:13} God will not withdraw his anger, and the most mightie helpes do stowpe vnder hym:
{9:14} Howe much lesse shall I aunswere him? or howe shoulde I finde out my wordes with him?
{9:15} For though I were righteous, yet might I not geue him one word againe, but mekely submit my selfe to hym as my iudge.
{9:16} If I had called vpon hym, and he had aunswered me, yet woulde I not beleue that he hearde my voyce:
{9:17} He troubleth me so with the tempest, and woundeth me out of measure without a cause,
{9:18} He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitternesse.
{9:19} If men will speake of strength, lo he is strong: if men will speake of iudgement, who shall bring me in to pleade?
{9:20} If I will iustifie my selfe, myne owne mouth shall condempne me: if I will put foorth my selfe for a perfect man, he shall proue me a wicked doer.
{9:21} For though I be an innocent and my conscience cleare, yet am I weery of my lyfe.
{9:22} This is one poynt, and therefore I sayd, He destroyeth both the perfect and vngodly.
{9:23} And though he slay sodaynly with the scourge, yet will he laugh at the punishment of the innocent.
{9:24} As for the worlde it is geuen ouer into the hande of the wicked, and he shall couer the faces of the iudges therof: if not, where is he, or who is he that can shewe the contrarie?
{9:25} My dayes are more swyft then a runner, they are gone & haue seene no good thing.
{9:26} They are passed away as the shippes that be good vnder sayle, & as the eagle that fleeth to the pray.
{9:27} If I say, I will forget my complayning, I will ceasse from my wrath, and comfort my selfe:
{9:28} Then am I afrayde of all my sorowes, for I knowe that thou wilt not iudge me innocent.
{9:29} If I be wicked, why then labour I in vayne?
{9:30} If I washe my selfe with snowe water, and make myne handes neuer so cleane at the well:
{9:31} Yet shalt thou dippe me in the myre, and mine owne clothes shal defile me.
{9:32} For he that I must geue aunswere vnto, and with whom I go to the lawe, is not a man as I am:
{9:33} Neither is there any dayesman to lay his hande betweene vs.
{9:34} Let hym take his rodde away from me, yea let hym make me no more afrayde of him,
{9:35} And then shall I aunswere hym without any feare: but because I am not so, I holde me still.
{10:1} My soule is cut of though I lyue, I wil powre out my coplaynte against my selfe, and will speake out of the very heauinesse of my soule.
{10:2} I will say vnto God: O do not condempne me, but shewe me wherefore thou contendest so with me?
{10:3} Thinkest thou it welldone to oppresse me? to cast me of beyng the workes of thy handes? and to mayntayne the counsell of the vngodly?
{10:4} Hast thou fleshy eyes? or doest thou loke as a man loketh?
{10:5} Or are thy dayes as the dayes of man? and thy yeres as mans yeres?
{10:6} That thou makest such inquisition for my wickednes, and searchest out my sinne?
{10:7} Whereas thou knowest whether I shall do wickedly or no, and that none can deliuer me out of thyne hande.
{10:8} Thy handes haue made me, & fashioned me altogether rounde about, wilt thou then destroy me?
{10:9} Remember I besech thee that thou madest me as the moulde of the earth, and shalt bring me into dust againe.
{10:10} Hast thou not powred me as it were milke, & turned me to cruddes like cheese?
{10:11} Thou hast couered me with skinne and fleshe, and ioyned me together with bones and sinnowes.
{10:12} Thou hast graunted me life, and done me good: and thy visitation hath preserued my spirite.
{10:13} Thou hast hyd these thinges in thyne heart yet I am sure that thou remembrest this thing.
{10:14} If I dyd sinne, thou haddest an eye vnto me, and shalt not pronounce me innocent from myne offence.
{10:15} If I haue done wickedly, wo is me therefore: If I haue done righteously, yet dare I not lift vp my head, so full am I of confusion, and see myne owne miserie.
{10:16} And let it increase, hunte me as a lion, & returne and shew thy selfe maruaylous vpon me.
{10:17} Thou bringest freshe witnesse against me, and thy wrath increasest thou vpon me: diuers and many are the plagues that I am in.
{10:18} Wherfore hast thou brought me out of the wombe? O that I had perished, and that no eye had seene me,
{10:19} And that I were as though I had not ben, but brought from the wombe to the graue.
{10:20} Are not my dayes fewe? Let him then leaue of fro me, and let me a lone, that I may comfort my selfe a litle,
{10:21} Afore I go thyther from whence I shall not turne againe, euen to the lande of darknesse and shadowe of death:
{10:22} Yea a lande as darke as darknesse it selfe, and into the shadowe of death where is none order, but the light is there as darknesse.
{11:1} Then aunswered Sophar the Naamathite, and sayde;
{11:2} Shoulde not he that maketh many wordes be aunswered? Shoulde he that bableth much be commended therin?
{11:3} Shoulde thy lies make men holde their peace, and when thou mockest others shall no man make thee ashamed?
{11:4} For thou hast sayde, my doctrine is pure, and I am cleane in thyne eyes.
{11:5} But O that God woulde speake, and open his lippes against thee:
{11:6} That he might shewe thee the secretes of wysdome, howe thou hast deserued double according to right: Know therfore that God hath forgotten thee for thyne iniquitie.
{11:7} Art thou able to finde out the secretes of God? Or wilt thou attayne to the perfectnesse of the almightie?
{11:8} It is hier then heauen, what art thou able to do? deeper then the hel, how wilt thou then knowe it?
{11:9} The measure of it is longer then the earth, and broder then the sea.
{11:10} Though he turne all thinges vpsyde downe, close them in, gather them together, who will turne hym from his purpose?
{11:11} For it is he that knoweth vayne men, he seeth their wickednesse also, shoulde he not then consider it?
{11:12} Yet vayne man would be wyse, though man newe borne is lyke a wilde asses coulte.
{11:13} If thou preparedst thyne heart, and liftedst vp thyne handes towarde hym:
{11:14} If thou wouldest put away the wickednes whiche thou hast in hande, so that no vngodlinesse dwell in thy house:
{11:15} Then mightest thou lift vp thy face without shame, & then shouldest thou be sure and haue no neede to feare.
{11:16} Then shouldest thou forget thy miserie, and thinke no more vpon it, then vpon the waters that runne by.
{11:17} Then should thy lyfe be as cleare as the noone day, thou shouldest shine forth, and be as the morning.
{11:18} Then mightest thou be bolde because there is hope, and take thy rest quietly, as compassed with a trenche.
{11:19} Then mightest thou lye downe and none to make thee afrayde, yea many one should make suite vnto thee.
{11:20} As for the eyes of the vngodly they shall faile, and they shal not escape: and their hope shalbe sorowe of minde.
{12:1} So Iob aunswered, & saide:
{12:2} Then no doubt ye are the men alone, and wysdome shall perishe with you.
{12:3} But I haue vnderstanding aswell as ye, and am not inferior to you: Yea who knoweth not these thinges?
{12:4} I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth vpon God, & he heareth him: The iust & the vpright is laughed to scorne.
{12:5} Being as alight despised in the heartes of the riche, and as one redy to fall.
{12:6} The houses of robbers are in wealth and prosperitie, and they that maliciouslie meddle against God dwell without care, in those thinges that God hath geuen richely with his hande.
{12:7} Aske the cattaile, and they shall enfourme thee: the foules of the ayre, and they shall tell thee.
{12:8} Or the encrease of the earth, and it shall shew thee: or the fishes of the sea, and they shall certifie thee.
{12:9} What is he but he knoweth that the hande of the Lorde made all these?
{12:10} In whose hande is the soule of euery liuing thing, and the breath of all mankinde.
{12:11} Haue not the eares pleasure in hearing? and the mouth in tasting the thing that it eateth?
{12:12} Among olde persons there is wysedome, and in age is vnderstanding.
{12:13} Yea, with God is wysdome and strength, it is he that hath counsell and foreknowledge.
{12:14} Beholde if he breake downe a thing, who can set it vp againe? yf he shut a thing, who wyll open it?
{12:15} Beholde, if he withholde the waters, they drye vp: yf he let them go, they destroy the earth.
{12:16} With him is strength and wysdome: both the deceauer and he that is deceaued are his.
{12:17} He carieth away the wyse men as it were a spoyle, and bringeth the iudges out of their wittes.
{12:18} He taketh away the subiection of the people from their kinges, and girdeth their loynes with a bonde.
{12:19} He leadeth away the great men into captiuitie, and turneth the mightie vpside downe.
{12:20} He stoppeth the mouth of them that speake trueth, & disapoynteth the aged of their reason.
{12:21} He powreth contempt vpon princes, and maketh the strength of the mightie weake.
{12:22} Loke what lyeth hid in darkenesse he declareth it openly, and the very shadowe of death bringeth he to light.
{12:23} He both increaseth the people and destroyeth them, he maketh them to multiplie, and diminisheth them.
{12:24} He taketh away the hearte of them that be heades of ye people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in the wildernesse out of the way.
{12:25} They grope in the darke without light, and he maketh them to stacker like a drunken man.
{13:1} Lo, all this haue I seene with mine eye, heard with mine eare, and vnderstande it.
{13:2} What ye knowe, that same do I know also, neither am I inferior vnto you.
{13:3} Neuerthelesse, I talke with the almightie, and my desire is to commune with God.
{13:4} As for you, ye are workmaisters of lyes, and vnprofitable phisitians altogether.
{13:5} Woulde God ye kept your tongue, for then might ye be taken for wise men.
{13:6} Now heare my reasoning, and ponder the argument of my lippes.
{13:7} Wyll you speake wickedlie for gods defence and talke deceitfully for his cause?
{13:8} Wyll ye accept the person of him? or wyll ye contende for God?
{13:9} Shall that helpe you when he calleth you to reckening? For as one man mocketh an other, so do ye mocke him.
{13:10} He shall punishe you, and reproue you, if ye do secretly accept any person.
{13:11} Shall not his excellencie make you afrayde? Shall not his terrible feare fall vpon you?
{13:12} Your remembraunce is lyke vnto a sparke, and your bodies lyke the claye.
{13:13} Holde your tongues for my sake, that I also may speake, and my sorowe shalbe the lesse.
{13:14} Wherefore do I beare my fleshe in my teeth, and put my soule in myne handes?
{13:15} Lo, though he slay me, yet wyl I trust in him: but I wyll reproue myne owne wayes in his sight.
{13:16} He shalbe my saluation: for there may no hypocrite come before him.
{13:17} Heare diligently my wordes, and ponder my sayinges with your eares.
{13:18} Beholde, now haue I prepared my iudgement, and knowe that I shalbe founde righteous.
{13:19} What is he that wyll go to lawe with me? if I now holde my tongue I dye.
{13:20} Neuerthelesse, graunt me two thinges, and then wyll I not hide my selfe from thee:
{13:21} Withdrawe thyne hande from me, and let not the fearefull dreade of thee make me afrayde.
{13:22} Then call, and I wyll aunswere: or let me speake, and geue me then an aunswere.
{13:23} How many are my misdeedes and sinnes? let me knowe my transgressions and offences.
{13:24} Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thyne enemie?
{13:25} Wylt thou breake a leafe driuen to and fro, and wilt thou pursue the drye stubble?
{13:26} For thou layest sharply to my charge, and punishest me for the sinnes of my youth.
{13:27} Thou puttest my feete also in the stockes, and lokest narowly vnto all my pathes, and makest the print thereof in the heeles of my feete:
{13:28} And I as a rotten thing do consume away, as a garment that is moth eaten.
{14:1} Man that is borne of woman, hath but a short time to lyue, and is full of miserie.
{14:2} He commeth vp, and is cut downe like a floure: He fleeth as it were a shadow, and neuer continueth in one state.
{14:3} Doest thou open thyne eyes vpon such one, and bringest me into thy iudgement?
{14:4} Who can make it cleane that commeth of an vncleane thing? no bodye.
{14:5} The dayes of man surely are determined, the number of his monethes are knowen onely vnto thee, thou hast appoynted him his bondes which he can not go beyonde.
{14:6} Go from him, that he may rest vntill his day come which he loketh for, lyke as an hireling doth.
{14:7} For if a tree be cut downe, there is some hope yet that it wyll sproute and shoote foorth the braunches againe.
{14:8} Though the roote of it be waxen olde, and the stocke thereof be dead in the grounde:
{14:9} Yet when it getteth the sent of water, it wyll budde and bring foorth bowes, lyke as a tree that is planted.
{14:10} But as for man, when he is dead, perished, and consumed away, what becommeth of him?
{14:11} As the waters passe from the sea, and as the flood decayeth and dryeth vp:
{14:12} So man after he is asleepe ryseth not, he shall not wake tyll the heauens be no more, nor rise out of his sleepe.
{14:13} O that thou wouldest hide me in the graue, & keepe me secret vntyl thy wrath were past, and to appoynt me a time wherein thou mightest remember me.
{14:14} May a dead man lyue againe? All the dayes of my lyfe wyll I wayte still, till my chaunging shall come.
{14:15} Thou shalt call me and I shall aunswere thee, despise not thou the worke of thyne owne handes.
{14:16} For now thou numbrest all my goinges, and geuest no delay vnto my sinne.
{14:17} Myne iniquitie is sealed vp as it were in a bagge, and thou addest punishement vnto my wickednesse.
{14:18} The mountaines fal away at the last, the rockes are remoued out of their place.
{14:19} The waters pearse through the very stones by litle & litle, the floodes washe away the grauell and earth: so shalt thou destroy the hope of man.
{14:20} Thou preuaylest still against him, so that he passeth away: thou chaungest his estate and puttest him from thee.
{14:21} And whether his children come to worship or no, he can not tell: And if they be men of lowe degree, he knoweth not.
{14:22} But while his fleshe is vpon him, it must haue sorowe: and his soule shall mourne within him.
{15:1} Then aunswered Eliphaz the Themanite, and saide:
{15:2} Shall a wyse mans aunswere be as the winde, and fill a mans belly as it were with the winde of the east?
{15:3} Shall he reproue with a worde that is nothing worth, & speake the thinges which can do no good?
{15:4} Surely thou hast cast of feare, and restrainest prayer before God.
{15:5} For thy mouth setteth forth thyne owne iniquitie, seeing thou hast chosen the tongue of the craftie.
{15:6} Thyne owne mouth condempneth thee, and not I: yea, thyne owne lippes shape an aunswere against thee.
{15:7} Art thou the first man that euer was borne? or wast thou made before the hils?
{15:8} Hast thou heard the secret counsell of God? and doest thou restraine wysdome to thee?
{15:9} What knowest thou, that we knowe not? And what vnderstandest thou, but we can the same?
{15:10} With vs are both olde and aged men, yea such as haue liued longer then thy father.
{15:11} Thinkest thou it a small thing of the consolations of God? with thee is a lying worde.
{15:12} Why doth thyne heart so bewitche thee? And wherefore winckest thou with thyne eyes,
{15:13} That thy minde is so pufte vp against God, and lettest such wordes go out of thy mouth?
{15:14} What is man, that he should be cleane? and he which is borne of a woman, whereby he might be righteous?
{15:15} Beholde he doth not trust his sainctes, yea, the very heauens are not cleane in his sight:
{15:16} How much more then an abhominable and vyle man, which drincketh wickednesse like water.
{15:17} I will tel thee, heare me, and I will shewe thee that I haue seene:
{15:18} Which wyse men haue tolde, and haue not hid that which they receaued from theyr fathers:
{15:19} Unto whom alone the earth was geue, and no straunger went among them.
{15:20} The vngodly soroweth all the dayes of his lyfe as it were a woman with childe, and the number of a tirauntes yeres is vnknowen.
{15:21} A feareful sounde is euer in his eares, and when he is in peace, the destroyer shall come vpon him.
{15:22} He beleueth neuer to be deliuered out of darknesse: for the sworde is alwayes before his eyes.
{15:23} He wandreth abrode for bread where it is, knowing that the day of darkenesse is redie at his hande.
{15:24} Trouble and anguishe wil make him afrayde, and compasse him about, as is a king in the middest of an armie.
{15:25} For he hath stretched out his hande against God, and armed him selfe against the almightie.
{15:26} He runneth proudly vpon him, & with a stiffe necke fighteth he against him.
{15:27} Where as he couereth his face with fatnesse, and maketh his body well lyking.
{15:28} Therefore shall his dwelling be in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, but are become heapes of stones.
{15:29} He shall not be riche, neither shall his substaunce continue, neither shal the prosperitie thereof be prolonged vpon earth.
{15:30} He shall neuer depart out of darkenesse, the flame shal drye vp his branches, with the blast of ye mouth of God shall he be taken away.
{15:31} He beleeueth not that he erreth in vanitie, and yet vanitie shalbe his recompence.
{15:32} He shal perishe afore his time be worne out, and his braunche shall not be greene.
{15:33} He shalbe plucked of as an vntimely grape from the vine, and shall let his floure fall as the oliue doth.
{15:34} For the congregation of hypocrites shalbe desolate, and the fire shall consume the houses of such as are greedie to receaue giftes.
{15:35} He conceaueth trauaile, and beareth vanitie, and their body bringeth foorth disceyte.
{16:1} Iob aunswered, & saide:
{16:2} I haue oft times heard such thinges: miserable geuers of comfort are ye all the sort of you.
{16:3} Shall not vaine wordes come yet to an ende? Or what maketh thee bolde so to aunswere?
{16:4} I coulde speake as ye do also: but would God that your soule were in my soules steade, then could I frame wordes for you, and shake my head at you:
{16:5} I shoulde comfort you with my mouth, & releasse your paine with the talking of my lippes.
{16:6} For all my wordes my sorowe wyll not ceasse: And though I holde my tongue, what am I eased?
{16:7} But now that God hath sent me aduersitie, thou hast troubled al my congregation.
{16:8} And that thou hast filled me with wrinckles my fleshe is recorde, and my leanenesse ryseth vp against me and beareth witnes thereof in my face.
{16:9} His wrath hath torne me he hateth me, & gnasheth vpon me with his teeth: myne enemie loketh fiercely vpon me with his eyes.
{16:10} They haue opened their mouthes wide vpon me, and smitten me vpon the cheeke dispitefully, they gather the selues together against me.
{16:11} God hath shut me vp with the vngodly, and deliuered me into the handes of the wicked.
{16:12} I was in wealth, but he hath brought me to nought: he hath taken me by the necke, he hath all to shaken me, and set me as a marke for him selfe.
{16:13} His archers compasse me rounde about, he woundeth my raines, and doth not spare, my bowels hath he powred vpon the grounde.
{16:14} He hath geuen me one wounde vpon an other, and is fallen vpon me lyke a giaunt.
{16:15} I haue sowed a sackecloth vpon my skinne, and wallowed my head in the dust.
{16:16} My face is withered with weeping, & in mine eyes is the shadowe of death.
{16:17} Howbeit there is no wickednesse in my handes, but my prayer is cleane.
{16:18} O earth couer not thou my blood, and let my crying finde no roome.
{16:19} For lo, my witnesse is in heauen, and he that knoweth me, is in the height.
{16:20} My friendes geue me many wordes to scorne, and myne eye powreth out teares vnto God.
{16:21} O that a body might pleate with God, as one man doth with an other:
{16:22} Yet the number of my yeres is come, and the way that I must go is at hand, from whence I shall not turne againe.
{17:1} My breath is corrupt, my dayes are shortened, I am harde at deathes doore.
{17:2} Froward men are with me, and myne eye must continue in the bitternesse of them.
{17:3} O deliuer me, and loke out one to be my suretie in thy sight: what is he that knoweth who wyll promise for me?
{17:4} For thou hast withholden their heartes from vnderstanding, therefore shalt thou not set them vp on hie.
{17:5} He that speaketh flatterie to his friend, the eyes of his children shall fayle.
{17:6} He hath made me a byworde of the people, where as afore I was their ioy.
{17:7} Myne eye is dimme for very heauinesse, and all my strength is lyke a shadowe.
{17:8} Vertuous men therefore shall well consider this, and the innocent shal take part against the hypocrite.
{17:9} The righteous also wyll kepe his way, and he that hath cleane handes wyll euer be stronger and stronger.
{17:10} As for al you, turne you and get you hence I pray you seeing I can not finde one wyse man among you.
{17:11} My dayes are past, and my counsailes and thoughtes of my heart are vanished away,
{17:12} Chaunging the night into day, and the light approching into darkenesse.
{17:13} Though I tary neuer so much, yet the graue is my house, & I haue made my bed in the darke.
{17:14} I saide to corruption, thou art my father, and to the wormes, you are my mother and my sister.
{17:15} Where is then now my hope? or who hath considered the thing that I loke for?
{17:16} (17:15) These shall go downe with me into the pit, and lye with me in the dust.
{18:1} Then aunswered Bildad the Suhite, and saide:
{18:2} When wyll ye make an ende of your wordes? Marke well, and then we wyll speake.
{18:3} Wherfore are we counted as beastes, and reputed so vyle in your sight?
{18:4} He destroyeth him selfe with his anger: Shall the earth be forsaken, or any stone remoued out of his place because of thee?
{18:5} Yea, the light of the vngodly shalbe put out, and the sparke of his fire shall not shine.
{18:6} The light shall be darke in his dwelling, and his candle shall be put out with him.
{18:7} The steppes of his strength shalbe restrayned, and his owne counsaile shall cast him downe:
{18:8} For his feete are taken as it were in the net, & he walketh vpon the snares.
{18:9} The grinne shall take him by the heele, and it shall catche him that is thirstie of blood.
{18:10} The snare is layde for him in the grounde, and a pitfall in the way.
{18:11} Fearefulnesse shall make him afraide on euery side, and shall driue him to his feete.
{18:12} Hunger shalbe his strength, and destruction shalbe redye at his side.
{18:13} It shall eate the strength of his owne skinne, euen the first borne of death shall eate his strength.
{18:14} His hope shalbe rooted out of his dwelling, and shall bring him to the king of feare.
{18:15} Other men shall dwell in his house, and it shalbe none of his, and brimstone shall be scattered vpon his habitation.
{18:16} His rootes shalbe dryed vp beneath, and aboue shall his braunche be cut downe.
{18:17} His remembraunce shall perishe from the earth, and he shall haue no name in the streete.
{18:18} They shall driue him from the light into darkenesse, and chaste him cleane out of the worlde.
{18:19} He shall neither haue children nor kinsfolkes among his people, no nor any posteritie in his dwellinges.
{18:20} They that come after him, shalbe astonyed at his day, and they that go before shalbe afrayde.
{18:21} Such are now the dwellinges of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
{19:1} Iob aunswered, and saide:
{19:2} How long wyll ye vexe my soule, and trouble me with wordes?
{19:3} Lo, ten times haue ye reproched me, and are not ashamed, but haue laughed me to scorne.
{19:4} Be it that I haue erred in deede, myne errour then remaineth with my selfe.
{19:5} But if ye wyll aduaunce your selues against me, and rebuke me for the shame that is come vpon me:
{19:6} Know this then, that it is God which hath ouerthrowe me, and hath compassed me with his net.
{19:7} If I complaine of the violence that is done vnto me, I cannot be heard: and if I crye, there is no sentence geuen with me.
{19:8} He hath hedged vp my way that I can not passe, and he hath set darkenesse in my pathes.
{19:9} He hath spoyled me of myne honour, and taken the crowne away from my head.
{19:10} He hath destroyed me on euery side and I am gone: my hope hath he taken away as a tree pluckt vp by the roote.
{19:11} His wrath is kindled against me, he taketh me as though I were his enemie.
{19:12} His men of warre come together, which made their way ouer me, and besieged my dwelling rounde about.
{19:13} He hath put my brethren farre away from me, and myne acquaintaunce are also become straungers vnto me.
{19:14} Myne owne kinsefolkes haue forsaken me, and my best acquainted haue forgotten me.
{19:15} The seruauntes and maydens of myne owne house toke me for a straunger, and I am become as an aliaunt in their sight.
{19:16} I called my seruaunt, and he gaue me no aunswere: no though I prayed him with my mouth.
{19:17} Myne owne wyfe might not abyde my breath, though I prayed her for the children sake of myne owne body.
{19:18} Yea, the young men despised me, and when I rose they spake euill vpon me.
{19:19} All my most familiers abhorred me: and they whom I loued best, are turned against me.
{19:20} My bone cleaueth to my skinne and to my fleshe, onely there is left me the skinne about my teeth.
{19:21} Haue pitie vpon me, haue pitie vpon me, O ye my friendes, for the hande of God hath touched me.
{19:22} Why do ye persecute me as God doth and are not satisfied with my fleshe?
{19:23} O that my wordes were now written, O that they were put in a booke,
{19:24} And grauen with an iron penne in leade, or in stone, to continue.
{19:25} For I am sure that my redeemer saueth, and he shall rayse vp at the latter day them that lye in the dust.
{19:26} And though after my skinne the wormes destroy this body, yet shall I see God in my fleshe:
{19:27} Whom I my selfe shall see, and myne eyes shall beholde, and none other for me, though my raines are consumed within me.
{19:28} But ye saide, why is he persecuted? and there was a deepe matter in me.
{19:29} But beware of the sworde: for the sword wylbe auenged of wickednesse, and be sure that there is a iudgement.
{20:1} Then aunswered Sophar the Naamathite, and saide:
{20:2} For the same cause do my thoughtes compell me to aunswere, and therefore, make haste.
{20:3} I haue sufficiently heard the checking of my reproofe, therefore the spirite of myne vnderstanding causeth me to aunswere.
{20:4} Knowest thou not this of olde, and since God plaged man vpon earth,
{20:5} That the gladnesse of the vngodlie hath ben short, and that the ioy of hypocrites continued but the twinckling of an eye?
{20:6} Though he be magnified vp to the heauen, so that his head reacheth vnto the cloudes:
{20:7} Yet at a turne he perisheth for euer, insomuch that they which haue seene him, shall say, Where is he?
{20:8} He shall vanishe as a dreame, so that he can no more be founde, and shal passe away as a vision in the night.
{20:9} So that the eye which sawe him before, shal haue no more sight of him, and his place shall know him no more.
{20:10} His children shalbe faine to agree with the poore, and his handes shall restore their goodes.
{20:11} From his youth his bones are full of pleasures, but now shall it lye downe within him in the earth.
{20:12} When wickednesse was sweete in his mouth, he hyd it vnder his tongue.
{20:13} That he fauoured, that would he not forsake, but kept it close in his throte.
{20:14} The bread that he did eate, is turned to the poyson of serpentes within his bodye.
{20:15} The riches that he deuoured shall he parbreake againe: for God shall drawe them out of his belly.
{20:16} He shall sucke the gall of serpentes, and the adders tongue shall slay him:
{20:17} So that he shall no more see the ryuers and brookes of hony and butter.
{20:18} The thing he hath laboured for, shall he restore, and shall not eate of it: great trauaile shall he make for riches, but he shall not enioy them.
{20:19} And why? he hath oppressed the poore, and not helped them: houses hath he spoyled, and not builded them.
{20:20} Because he could not perceaue when his belly was well, through his greedie desire he shall not escape.
{20:21} There shall none of his meate be left, therefore shall no man loke for his goodes.
{20:22} When he had plenteousnesse of euery thing, yet was he poore, though he was helped on euery side.
{20:23} And it shall come to passe, that wherewith he purposed to fill his belly, God shall powre the furie of his wrath theron, and shall cause his indignation to raigne vpon him, and vpon his meate.
{20:24} He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bowe of steele shall strike him through.
{20:25} The arowe is taken foorth and gone out of the quiuer, and a glistering sword through the gall of him: so feare shall come vpon him.
{20:26} All darknesse shalbe hid in their secrete places, an vnkindled fire shal consume him: and loke what remaineth in his house, it shalbe destroyed.
{20:27} The heauen shal declare his wickednesse, and the earth shall take part against him.
{20:28} The substaunce that he hath in his house, shalbe taken away and perishe in the day of the Lordes wrath.
{20:29} This is the portion that the wicked man shal haue of God, and the heritage that he may loke for of God, because of his wordes.
{21:1} Iob aunswered, and saide:
{21:2} O heare diligently my wordes, and that shalbe in steede of your consolations,
{21:3} Suffer me that I may speake, and when I haue spoken mocke on.
{21:4} Is it for mans sake that I make this disputation? Which if it were so, shoulde not my spirite then be in sore trouble?
{21:5} Marke me well and be abashed, and lay your hande vpon your mouth.
{21:6} For when I consider my selfe I am afrayde, and my fleshe is smitten with feare.
{21:7} Wherefore do wicked men liue, come to their olde age, and increase in richesse?
{21:8} Their children lyue in their sight, and their generation before their eyes.
{21:9} Their houses are safe from all feare, and the rod of God is not vpon them.
{21:10} Their bullocke gendreth and that not out of time, their cowe calueth and is not vnfruitfull.
{21:11} They sende foorth their children by flockes, & their sonnes leade the daunce.
{21:12} They beare with them tabrets and harpes, and reioyce in the sounde of the organs.
{21:13} They spend their dayes in wealthines, but sodainely they go downe to the graue.
{21:14} They say also vnto God: Go from vs, we desire not the knowledge of thy wayes.
{21:15} Who is the almightie that we should serue him? And what profite should we haue if we should pray vnto him?
{21:16} Lo, there is vtterly no goodnesse in their hande, therefore wyll I not haue to do with the counsaile of the vngodly.
{21:17} How oft shall the candell of the wicked be put out, and their destruction come vpon them? O what sorowe shall God geue them for their part in his wrath?
{21:18} Yea, they shalbe euen as hay before the winde, and as chaffe that the storme carieth away.
{21:19} God wyll lay vp the sorowe of the father for his children: & when he rewardeth him, he shall know it.
{21:20} Their owne miserie shal they see with their eyes, and drinke of the fearefull wrath of the almightie.
{21:21} For what careth he for his house after his death, when the number of his monethes is cut short?
{21:22} Seeing God hath the highest power of all, who can teache him any knowledge?
{21:23} One dyeth in his full strength, being in all ease and prosperitie,
{21:24} His breastes are full of milke, and his bones runne full of marowe.
{21:25} Another dyeth in the bitternes of his soule, and neuer eateth with pleasure.
{21:26} They shall sleepe both alyke in the earth, and the wormes shall couer them.
{21:27} Beholde, I know what ye thinke, yea and the subtiltie that ye imagine against me.
{21:28} For ye say where is the princes palace? and where is the dwelling of the vngodly?
{21:29} Haue ye not asked them that go by the way? Doubtlesse ye cannot denie their tokens,
{21:30} That the wicked is kept vnto the day of destruction, and the vngodly shalbe brought foorth to the day of wrath.
{21:31} Who dare declare his way to his face? who wil rewarde him for that he doth?
{21:32} Yet shall he be brought to his graue, and dwell among the heape of the dead.
{21:33} Then shal the slymie valley be sweet vnto him, all men also must folowe him, as there are innumerable gone before him.
{21:34} Howe vayne then is the comfort that ye geue me, seyng falshood remayneth in all your aunsweres?
{22:1} So Eliphas the Themanite gaue aunswere, and sayde:
{22:2} May a man be profitable vnto God, as he that is wise may be profitable vnto him selfe?
{22:3} Is it any aduauntage to the almightie that thou art righteous? or shall it profite him that thou makest thy wayes perfect?
{22:4} Is he afrayde to reproue thee, and to step foorth with thee into iudgement?
{22:5} Is not thy wickednesse great, and thy vngratious deedes innumerable?
{22:6} For thou hast taken the pledge from thy brother for naught, and robbed the naked of their clothing.
{22:7} To such as were weery, hast thou geuen no water to drinke, & hast withdrawen bread from the hungrie.
{22:8} But the mightie man had the earth, and he that was in auctoritie dwelt in it.
{22:9} Thou hast sent wydowes away emptie, and the armes of the fatherlesse were broken.
{22:10} Therefore art thou compassed about with snares, & sodenly vexed with feare.
{22:11} Shouldest thou then see no darknesse? shoulde not the water fludde run ouer thee?
{22:12} Is not God on high in the heauen? beholde the heyght of the starres how hie they are.
{22:13} Wilt thou therfore say, Tushe, howe should God know? can he iudge through the darke cloude?
{22:14} Tushe, the cloudes couer him that he may not see, and he walketh on the top of heauen.
{22:15} Hast thou marked the way of the world, wherin wicked men haue walked?
{22:16} Whiche were cut downe out of time, and whose foundation was as an ouerflowing ryuer.
{22:17} Whiche sayd vnto God, Go from vs: and asked what the almightie coulde do for them?
{22:18} He filled their houses with good things: but the counsell of the vngodly be farre from me.
{22:19} The righteous sawe it and were glad, and the innocent laughed them to scorne.
{22:20} Is our substaunce bewen downe? As for the remnaunt of them the fire hath consumed.
{22:21} Therefore reconcile thee vnto God, and be at peace: so shall all thinges prospere with thee right well.
{22:22} Receaue I pray thee the lawe at his mouth, and lay vp his wordes in thyne heart.
{22:23} For if thou wilt turne to the almightie, thou shalt be buyld vp, and put all vnrighteousnes from thy dwelling.
{22:24} Thou shalt lay vp golde as plentyful as the dust, and the golde of Ophir as the flyntes of the riuers.
{22:25} Yea almightie God his owne selfe shalbe thy defence, and thou shalt haue plentie of siluer.
{22:26} Then shalt thou haue thy delite in the almightie, and lift vp thy face vnto God.
{22:27} Then shalt thou make thy prayer vnto him, and he shall heare thee, and thou shalt kepe thy promises.
{22:28} Thou shalt also decree a thing, and he shall establishe it vnto thee, and the light shall shine in thy wayes.
{22:29} When the wicked be cast downe, thou shalt say, I am lifted vp: and God shall saue the humble person.
{22:30} The innocent shal deliuer the Ilande: it shalbe preserued by the purenesse of thyne handes.
{23:1} Iob aunswered, & said:
{23:2} Though my talke be this day in bitternesse, and my plague greater then my groning.
{23:3} O that I might know him, and finde him, and that I might come before his seate:
{23:4} I woulde pleade my cause before hym, and fill my mouth with argumentes:
{23:5} I woulde knowe what aunswere he woulde geue me, and vnderstande what he woulde say vnto me.
{23:6} Will he pleade against me with his great power? No, but he will make me the stronger.
{23:7} There the righteous might dispute with him, so shoulde I be deliuered for euer from my iudge.
{23:8} Behold, though I go forwarde I find him not: If I go backwarde, I can get no knowledge of hym:
{23:9} If I go on the left side where he doth his worke, I can not attayne vnto him: Againe, if I go on the right side, he hydeth him selfe that I can not see hym.
{23:10} But as for my way, he knoweth it, and tryeth me, that as the gold I may come foorth.
{23:11} My foote doth kepe his path, his hie way haue I holden, and will not go out of it.
{23:12} I will not forsake the commaundement of his lippes, I haue esteemed the wordes of his mouth more then myne appoynted foode.
{23:13} He is still at one poynt, and who can turne him? he doth as him listeth, and bringeth to passe what he will.
{23:14} He perfourmeth the thing that is appoynted for me, and many such thinges doth he.
{23:15} This is the cause that I shrinke at his presence, so that when I consider him, I am afrayde of hym.
{23:16} For God maketh my heart softe, and the almightie putteth me in feare.
{23:17} Because I am not cut of before the darkenesse, neither hath he couered the cloude fro my face.
{24:1} Considering then that there is no time hyd from the almightie, how happeneth it that they which know him do not regarde his dayes?
{24:2} For some men remoue the landemarkes, robbe men of their cattell, and feede of the same:
{24:3} They driue away the asse of the fatherlesse, and take the wydowes oxe for a pledge:
{24:4} They cause the poore to turne out of the way, so that the poore of the earth hyde them selues together.
{24:5} Beholde, as wilde asses in the desert go they foorth to their worke, & ryse betimes to spoyle: Yea the very wildernesse ministreth foode for them & their children.
{24:6} They reape the corne fielde that is not their owne, and let the vineyarde of the vngodly alone.
{24:7} They cause the naked to lodge without garment, and without couering in the colde.
{24:8} They are wet with the showres of the mountaynes, and embrace the rocke for want of a couering.
{24:9} They plucke the fatherlesse from the brest, and take the pledge from the poore.
{24:10} They let hym go naked without clothing, and haue taken away the sheafe of the hungrie.
{24:11} The poore are fayne to labour in their oyle mylles, yea and to treade in their wyne presses, and yet to suffer thirst.
{24:12} Men out of the citie crye vnto the Lord with sighing, the soules of the slayne also crye out, yet God regardeth not their complaynt.
{24:13} Where as they are conuersaunt among them that abhorre the light, they know not his way, nor continue in his pathes.
{24:14} The murtherer ryseth early and killeth the poore and needy, and in the night is as a thiefe?
{24:15} The eye of the adulterer wayteth for the darkenesse, & sayth, There shall no eye see me: and disguiseth his face.
{24:16} In the darke they digge through houses, whiche they marked for them selues in the day time: they knowe not the light.
{24:17} The morning is to them euen as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrours of the shadowe of death,
{24:18} The vngodly is swyft vpon the water: their portion shalbe cursed in the earth, and he shall not beholde the way of the vineyardes.
{24:19} As the drye grounde and heate consume the snowye waters: so shall the graue the sinners.
{24:20} The pitifull man shall forget hym, he shalbe sweete to the wormes, he shalbe no more remembred, & his wickednesse shalbe broken as a tree.
{24:21} He hath oppressed the barren that can not beare, and vnto the wydow hath he done no good.
{24:22} He drue the mightie after hym with his power, and when he was gotten vp no man was sure of lyfe.
{24:23} And though they gaue him to be in safetie, yet his eyes are vpon their wayes.
{24:24} They are exalted for a litle, but shortly are gone, brought to pouertie, and taken out of the way, yea and vtterly pluckt of, as the eares of corne.
{24:25} Is it not so? Who will then reproue me as a lyer, and say that my wordes are nothing worth? Bildad proueth that no man is cleane nor without sinne before God.
{25:1} Then aunswered Bildad the Suhite, and sayde:
{25:2} Is there power and feare with him aboue, that maketh peace sitting in his hyghnesse?
{25:3} Is there any number of his armies, and vpon whom shal not his light arise?
{25:4} But how may a man compared vnto God, be iustified? or how can he be cleane that is borne of a woman?
{25:5} Beholde, the moone shyneth nothing in comparison to him, and the starres are vncleane in his sight.
{25:6} Howe much more then man that is but corruption, and the sonne of man which is but a worme?
{26:1} Iob aunswered, and sayde:
{26:2} Who hast thou helped? Him that is without strength? sauest thou the arme that hath no strength?
{26:3} Where is the counsayle that thou shouldest geue him which hath no wisdome? Hast thou shewed the way of right lyuing?
{26:4} To whom hast thou spoken these wordes? who made the breath to come out of thy mouth?
{26:5} Are not dead thinges shapen vnder the waters, and thinges by the waters side?
{26:6} He is naked before him, and the very destruction it selfe can not be hyd out of his sight.
{26:7} He stretcheth out the noorth ouer the emptie place, and hangeth the earth vpon nothing.
{26:8} He byndeth the water in his cloudes, & the cloude is not broken vnder them.
{26:9} He holdeth backe the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloude before it.
{26:10} He hath compassed the waters with certayne boundes, vntill the day and night come to an ende.
{26:11} The very pillers of heauen tremble and quake at his reproofe.
{26:12} He stilleth the sea with his power, and through his wysdome smyteth he the strength therof.
{26:13} His spirite hath garnished the heauens, & his hand hath made the crooked serpent.
{26:14} Lo, this is now a short summe of his wayes: but howe litle a portion heare we of hym? who can vnderstande the thunder of his power?
{27:1} And Iob proceeded and went foorth in his parable, saying,
{27:2} As God lyueth whiche hath taken away my iudgement, and the almightie that hath vexed my minde:
{27:3} Whyle my breath is in me, and the winde that God hath geuen me is in my nostrels,
{27:4} My lippes shall talke of no vanitie, and my tongue shall speake no disceite.
{27:5} God forbyd that I should graunt your cause to be right: As for me, vntill myne end come will I neuer go fro myne innocentie.
{27:6} My righteous dealing kepe I fast, which I will not forsake: my heart shal not reproue me of my dayes.
{27:7} Therfore myne enemie shalbe founde as the vngodly, and he that taketh part against me, as the vnrighteous.
{27:8} For what hope hath the hypocrite though he haue great good, if God take away his soule?
{27:9} Will God heare his crye, when trouble commeth vpon him?
{27:10} Hath he such pleasure and delite in the almightie, that he dare alway call vpon God?
{27:11} I wil teache you in the name of God, and the thing of the almightie will I not kepe from you.
{27:12} Behold, all ye your selues haue seene it, why then do ye thus vanishe in vanitie?
{27:13} Saying: This is the portion that the wicked haue of God, and the heritage that tyrauntes shall receaue of the almightie.
{27:14} If he get many children, they shall perishe with the sworde, and his posteritie shall haue scarcenesse of bread.
{27:15} His remnaunt shalbe buried in death, and his widowes shall not weepe.
{27:16} Though he heape vp siluer as the dust, and prepare rayment as the clay:
{27:17} He may well prepare it, but the godly shall put it on, and the innocent shall deale out the money.
{27:18} He buyldeth his house as the moth, & as a booth that the watchman maketh.
{27:19} When the riche man sleepeth, he shall not be gathered to his fathers, they opened their eyes, and he was gone.
{27:20} Terrour taketh holde vpon hym as a water fludde, and the tempest stealeth him away in the night season.
{27:21} A vehement east winde caryeth him hence, and he departeth: a storme hurleth him out of his place.
{27:22} God shal cast vpon him, and not spare, though he woulde fayne flee out of his hande.
{27:23} Then clap men their handes at hym, and hisse at him out of his place.
{28:1} There is a place wher siluer is brought out of, and where golde is tryed,
{28:2} Where yron is digged out of the grounde, & stones resolued to metall.
{28:3} The darkenesse shall once come to an ende: he can seke out the grounde of all thinges, the stones, the darke, and the shadowe of death.
{28:4} He causeth the fluddes to breake out against the inhabitant, and the waters forgotten of the foote, beyng hygher then man, are gone away.
{28:5} Out of the same earth commeth bread, and vnder it as it were fire is turned vp.
{28:6} The stones of it are a place of Saphires, and the dust of it is golde.
{28:7} There is a way that the birdes knowe not, that no vultures eye hath seene:
{28:8} Wherin the lions whelpes walke not, and where no lion commeth.
{28:9} There putteth he his hande vpon the stonie rockes, and ouerthroweth the mountaynes by the rootes.
{28:10} Riuers flowe out of the rockes, & loke what is pleasaunt, his eye seeth it.
{28:11} He bindeth the fluddes that they do not ouerflow: and the thing that is hid bringeth he to light.
{28:12} Where then is wysdome founde? and where is the place of vnderstanding?
{28:13} Ueryly no man can tell howe worthy a thing she is, neither is she found in the lande of them that lyue.
{28:14} The deepe sayth, She is not in me: the sea sayth, She is not with me.
{28:15} She can not be gotten for golde, neither may the price of her be bought with any siluer.
{28:16} No wedges of gold of Ophir, no precious Onix stones, no Saphires may be valued with her.
{28:17} No, neither golde nor christall shall be equall vnto it, nor her exchaunge shalbe for the plate of fine golde.
{28:18} No mention shalbe made of Corall nor of the Gabis: for wisdome is more precious then pearles.
{28:19} The Topas of Ethiopia shall not be equall vnto it, neither shall it be valued with the wedge of pure golde.
{28:20} Whence then commeth wysdome? and where is the place of vnderstanding?
{28:21} She is hid from the eyes of all men liuing, yea & from the foules of the ayre.
{28:22} Destruction and death say, We haue hearde the fame therof with our eares.
{28:23} But God seeth her way, and knoweth her place.
{28:24} For he beholdeth the endes of the worlde, and loketh vpon all that is vnder heauen.
{28:25} When he wayed the windes and measured the waters:
{28:26} When he made a decree for the rayne, and a way for the lightninges of the thunder:
{28:27} Then dyd he see her, then declared he her, prepared her, and knewe her.
{28:28} And vnto man he sayd: To feare the Lorde is wysdome, and to forsake euyll is vnderstanding.
{29:1} So Iob proceeded and went foorth in his parable, saying:
{29:2} O that I were as I was in the monethes by past, and in the daies when God preserued me:
{29:3} When his light shined vpon my head, when I went after the same light and shining, euen through the darknesse:
{29:4} As it stoode with me when I was young, when God prospered my house:
{29:5} When the almightie was yet with me, when my children stoode about me:
{29:6} When my wayes ranne ouer with butter, and when the stonie rockes gaue me riuers of oyle:
{29:7} When I went out to the gate, euen to the iudgement seate, and when I prepared my seate in the streete:
{29:8} The young men saw me and hid them selues, and the aged arose, and stoode vp.
{29:9} The princes left of their talking, and layed their hand to their mouth:
{29:10} The mightie kept still their voyce, and their tongue cleaued to the roofe of their mouth.
{29:11} When the eare heard me, it blessed me: & when the eye sawe me, it gaue witnesse to me:
{29:12} For I deliuered the poore when he cryed, and the fatherlesse, and hym that had none to helpe hym.
{29:13} The blessing of him that was redy to perishe came vpon me, and I caused the widowes heart to reioyce.
{29:14} And why? I put vpon me righteousnesse, which couered me as a garment, and equitie was my crowne.
{29:15} I was an eye to the blinde, and a foote to the lame.
{29:16} I was a father to the poore: and when I knewe not the cause, I sought it out diligently.
{29:17} I brake the iawes of the vnrighteous man, and pluckt the spoyle out of his teeth.
{29:18} Then I sayde, I shall die in my nest: and I shall multiplie my dayes as the sande.
{29:19} For my roote was spread out by the waterside: and the deawe lay vpon my corne.
{29:20} Myne honour encreased more and more, & my bow was euer the stronger in my hande.
{29:21} Unto me men gaue eare, me they regarded, and with scilence they taried for my counsell.
{29:22} After my woordes they replied not, and my talke dropped vpon them.
{29:23} They wayted for me as for the raine: and gaped vpon me, as the grounde doeth to receaue the latter shoure.
{29:24} When I laughed, they beleued it not, & the light of my countenaunce would they not put out.
{29:25} When I agreed vnto their way, I was the chiefe, and sate as a king with his armie about him: and when they were in heauinesse, I was their comfortour.
{30:1} But nowe they that are younger then I haue me in derision: yea euen they whose fathers I would haue thought scorne to haue set with the dogges of my cattell.
{30:2} For wherto might the strength of their handes haue serued me? for the time was but lost among them.
{30:3} For very miserie and hunger they fled into the wildernesse, a darke place, horrible and waste,
{30:4} Plucking vp nettles among the busshes, and the iuniper rootes for their meate.
{30:5} And when they were dryuen foorth, men cryed after them as it had ben afafter a thiefe.
{30:6} Their dwelling was in the cleftes of brookes, yea in the caues and dennes of the earth.
{30:7} Among the busshes went they about crying, and vnder the thornes they gathered them selues together.
{30:8} They were the children of fooles and vyllaynes, which are more vile then the earth.
{30:9} Now am I their song, & am become their yesting stocke.
{30:10} They abhorre me and flee farre from me, and stayne my face with spittle.
{30:11} Because God hath loosed my corde and humbled me, they haue loosed the bridle before me.
{30:12} Upon my right hande ryse the young men against me, they haue hurt my feete, treading vpon me as vpon the wayes of their destruction.
{30:13} My pathes haue they cleane marred, it was so easye for them to do me harme, that they needed no man to help them.
{30:14} They fell vpon me, as it had ben the breaking in of waters, and came in by heapes to destroy me.
{30:15} Feare is turned vpon me, and they pursue my soule as the wind, and my health passeth away as a cloude.
{30:16} Therfore is my soule now powred out vpon me, and the dayes of my trouble haue taken hold vpon me.
{30:17} My bones are pearsed through in the night season, and my sinewes take no rest.
{30:18} For the vehemencie of sorowe is my garment chaunged, whiche compasseth me about as the coller of my coote.
{30:19} He hath cast me into the myre, and I am become like asshes and dust.
{30:20} When I crie vnto thee, thou doest not heare me: and though I stande before thee, yet thou regardest me not.
{30:21} Thou art become myne enemie, and with thy violent hande thou takest part against me.
{30:22} In times past thou diddest set me vp on hye, to be caried as it were aboue the wynde, but nowe hast thou geuen me a very sore fall.
{30:23} Sure I am that thou wilt bryng me vnto death, euen to the lodging that is due vnto all men liuing.
{30:24} Notwithstanding, thou wilt not stretch out thyne hand against him that is in the graue: shal men crie out against him that is in destruction?
{30:25} Dyd not I weepe with hym that was in trouble? Had not my soule compassion vpon the poore?
{30:26} Yet neuerthelesse, where as I loked for good, euyll came vnto me: & where I wayted for light, there came darkenesse.
{30:27} My bowels seethe in me without rest, for the dayes of my trouble are come vpon me.
{30:28} I went mourning without heate, I stoode vp in the congregation, & communed with them.
{30:29} But nowe I am a brother of dragons, and a felowe of Estriches.
{30:30} My skinne vpon me is turned to blacke, and my bones are brent with heate.
{30:31} My harpe is turned to mourning, and my organs into the voyce of them that weepe.
{31:1} I made a couenaunt with myne eyes: why then should I loke vpon a mayden?
{31:2} For how great a portion shall I haue of God? and what inheritaunce from the almightie on hye?
{31:3} Is not destruction to the wicked? and straunge punishement to the workers of iniquitie?
{31:4} Doth not he see my wayes, and tell all my goynges?
{31:5} If I haue walked in vanitie, or if my feete haue runne to disceaue:
{31:6} Let me be wayed in an euen balaunce, that God may see myne innocencie.
{31:7} If my steppe hath turned out of the way, & myne heart walked after myne eyes, and if any blot haue cleaued to my handes:
{31:8} Then shall I sowe, and an other eate: yea my posteritie shalbe cleane rooted out.
{31:9} If my heart haue ben deceaued by a woman, or if I haue layde wayte at my neyghbours doore:
{31:10} Then let my wife grinde vnto an other man, and let other men lye with her.
{31:11} For this is a wickednesse, and sinne that is worthy to be punished:
{31:12} Yea a fire that vtterly should consume and roote out all my increase.
{31:13} If I euer thought scorne to do right vnto my seruauntes & maydens, when they had any matter against me:
{31:14} When God will sit in iudgement, what shall I do? & when he will visite me, what aunswere shal I geue him?
{31:15} He that fashioned me in my mothers wombe, made he not him also? were we not both shapen a like in our mothers bodies?
{31:16} If I denied the poore of their desire, or haue caused the eyes of the wydow to wayte in vayne:
{31:17} If I haue eaten my morsell alone, that ye fatherlesse hath not eaten therof:
{31:18} (For from my youth it hath growen vp with me as with a father, and from my mothers wombe I haue ben guyde to the wydowe)
{31:19} If I haue seene any perishe for want of clothing, or any poore for lake of rayment:
{31:20} If his loynes haue not blessed me, because he was warmed with the fleece of my sheepe:
{31:21} If I haue lift vp mine hand against the fatherlesse, when I sawe that I might helpe him in the gate:
{31:22} Then let myne arme fall fro my shoulder, and myne arme holes be broken from the bone.
{31:23} For I haue euer feared the vengeaunce and punishment of God, and knewe very well that I was not able to beare his burthen.
{31:24} Haue I put my trust in golde? or haue I sayde to the wedge of golde, thou art my confidence?
{31:25} Haue I reioyced because my power was great, and because my hande gat so much?
{31:26} Dyd I euer greatly regarde the rysing of the sunne? or had I the goyng downe of the moone in great reputation?
{31:27} Hath my heart medled priuyly with any disceite? or did I euer kisse myne owne hande?
{31:28} (That were a wickednesse worthy to be punished: for then shoulde I haue denyed the God that is aboue.)
{31:29} Haue I euer reioyced at the hurt of myne enemie? or was I euer glad that any harme happened vnto him? Oh, no.
{31:30} I neuer suffred my mouth to sinne, by wishing a curse to his soule.
{31:31} Dyd not the men of myne owne housholde say, Who shall let vs to haue our belly full of his fleshe?
{31:32} The straunger dyd not lodge in the streete, but I opened my doores vnto him that went by the way.
{31:33} Haue I kept secrete my sinne, and hyd myne iniquitie, as Adam dyd?
{31:34} Though I coulde haue made afeard a great multitude, yet the most contemptible of the families dyd feare me: so I kept scilence, and went not out of the doore.
{31:35} O that I had one which woulde heare me: beholde my signe in the whiche the almightie shal aunswere for me, though he that is my contrarie partie hath written a booke against me.
{31:36} Yet will I take it vpon my shoulder, & as a garlande binde it about my head.
{31:37} I will tell hym the number of my goinges, & go vnto him as to a prince.
{31:38} But if case be that my lande crye against me, or that the forowes thereof make any complaynt:
{31:39} If I haue eaten the fruites therof vnpayed for, yea if I haue greeued the soules of the maisters therof:
{31:40} Then let thystles growe in steede of my wheate, and cockle for my barlye.
{32:1} So these three men ceassed to aunswere Iob, because he held him selfe a righteous man.
{32:2} But Elihu the sonne of Barachel the Buzite, of the kinred of Ram, was very sore displeased at Iob, because he called hym selfe iust before God.
{32:3} And with Iobs three friendes he was angry also, because they had founde no reasonable aunswere, and yet condempned Iob.
{32:4} Nowe taried Elihu, till they had ended their comunication with Iob: for why? they were elder then he.
{32:5} So when Elihu sawe that these three men were not able to make Iob aunswere, he was miscontent.
{32:6} Therfore Elihu the sonne of Barachel the Buzite aunswered, and sayde: Considering that I am young, and ye be men of age, I was afrayde, and durst not shewe foorth my mynde.
{32:7} For I thought thus within my selfe: It becommeth old men to speake, and the aged to teache wysdome.
{32:8} Euery man no doubt hath a mynde, but it is the inspiration of the almightie that geueth vnderstanding.
{32:9} Great men are not alway wyse, neither doth euery aged man vnderstande the thing that is lawfull:
{32:10} Therefore I say, heare me, and I wil shewe you also myne vnderstanding.
{32:11} For when I had wayted till ye made an end of your talking, and hearde your wysdome, what argumentes ye made in your communication,
{32:12} Yea when I had diligently pondred what ye sayde, I found not one of you that made any good argument against Iob, that directly could make aunswere vnto his wordes,
{32:13} Lest ye should say: We haue found out wisdome, God shall cast hym downe, and no man.
{32:14} He hath not spoken vnto me, and I wil not aunswere hym as ye haue done.
{32:15} For they were so abashed, that they coulde not make aunswere, nor speake one worde.
{32:16} When I had wayted (for they spake not, but stoode still and aunswered no more:)
{32:17} Then aunswered I in my turne, and I shewed myne opinion.
{32:18} For I am full of matter, and the spirite within me compelleth me.
{32:19} Beholde, my belly is as the wine, whiche hath no vent, lyke the newe bottels that bruste.
{32:20} Therfore will I speake, that I may haue a bent: I will open my lippes, and make aunswere.
{32:21} I will regarde no maner of person, no man will I spare.
{32:22} For if I woulde go about to please men, I knowe not howe soone my maker would take me away.
{33:1} Wherefore heare my wordes O Iob, and hearken vnto all that I will say:
{33:2} Behold, I haue now opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my throte.
{33:3} My heart doth order my wordes aright, and my lippes talke of pure wysedome.
{33:4} The spirite of God hath made me, and the breath of the almightie hath geuen me my lyfe.
{33:5} If thou canst then geue me aunswere, prepare thy selfe and stande before me face to face.
{33:6} Beholde, before God I am euen as thou: for I am fashioned & made euen of the same molde.
{33:7} Beholde, my terrour shall not feare thee, neither shall my hande be heauy vpon thee.
{33:8} Now hast thou spoken in myne eares, & I haue heard the voyce of thy wordes:
{33:9} I am cleane without any fault, I am innocent, & there is no wickednesse in me.
{33:10} But lo, he hath piked a quarell against me, and taketh me for his enemie.
{33:11} He hath put my foote in the stockes, and looketh narowlye vnto all my pathes.
{33:12} Behold, in this hast thou not done right, I wil make aunswere vnto thee, that God is greater then man.
{33:13} And why doest thou then striue against him? for he shall not geue the accomptes of all his wordes.
{33:14} For God speaketh once or twise, and yet man vnderstandeth it not.
{33:15} In dreames and visions of the night, when slumbring commeth vpon men that they fall asleepe in their beddes,
{33:16} He roundeth them in the eares, and sealeth their correction:
{33:17} That he may withdrawe man from euyll enterprises, and deliuer hym from pride,
{33:18} And kepe his soule from the graue, and his life from the sworde.
{33:19} He chasteneth hym with sickenesse vpon his bedde, he layeth sore punishement vpon his bones:
{33:20} So that his lyfe may away with no bread, and his soule abhorreth to eate any dayntie meate:
{33:21} In so much that his body is cleane consumed away, and his bones appeare which before were not seene.
{33:22} His soule draweth vnto the graue, and his lyfe to death.
{33:23} Now yf there be a messenger, one among a thousande, sent for to speake vnto man, and to shew him the right way:
{33:24} Then the Lord is mercifull vnto him, and sayth, He shalbe deliuered, that he fall not downe to the graue: for I am sufficiently reconciled.
{33:25} Then shal his fleshe be as freshe as a childes, and shal returne as in the dayes of his youth.
{33:26} He shall pray vnto God, and he will be fauorable vnto him, and he shall see his face with ioy, for he will render vnto man his righteousnesse.
{33:27} A respect hath he vnto men, let man then say, I haue offended, I did vnrighteously, & it hath done me no good:
{33:28} Yea he hath deliuered my soule from destruction, and my lyfe shall see the light.
{33:29} Lo all these worketh God alway with man:
{33:30} That he bring backe his soule from the graue to the light, yea the light of the lyuing.
{33:31} Marke wel O Iob, and heare me: hold thee still, and I will speake.
{33:32} But if thou hast any thing to say, then aunswere me, and speake: for I desire to iustifie thee.
{33:33} If thou hast nothing, then heare me, and hold thy tongue, and I shall teache thee wysdome.
{34:1} Elihu proceeding in his aunswere, sayde:
{34:2} Heare my wordes O ye wise men, hearken vnto me ye that haue vnderstanding:
{34:3} For the eare discerneth wordes, and the mouth tasteth the meates.
{34:4} As for iudgement, let vs seke it out among our selues, that we may knowe what is good.
{34:5} And why? Iob hath sayd, I am righteous, and God hath taken away my iudgement.
{34:6} In my right I shoulde be a lyer: my wounde is incurable without my fault.
{34:7} Where is there such a one as Iob, that drinketh vp scornefulnesse like water?
{34:8} Which goeth in the companie of wicked doers, and walketh with vngodly men?
{34:9} For he hath sayde, It profiteth a man nothing that he shoulde walke with God.
{34:10} Therfore hearken vnto me ye that haue vnderstanding: farre be it from God that he shoulde meddle with wickednesse, & farre be it from the almightie that he shoulde meddle with vnrighteous dealing.
{34:11} For he shall rewarde man after his workes, and cause euery man to finde according to his wayes.
{34:12} Sure it is that God wil not do wickedly, neither wyll the almightie paruert iudgement.
{34:13} Who ruleth the earth but he? or who hath placed the whole world?
{34:14} If he set his heart vpon man and gather vnto hym selfe his spirite and his breath,
{34:15} All fleshe shall come to naught at once, and all men shall turne againe vnto dust.
{34:16} If thou nowe haue vnderstanding, heare what I say, and hearken to the voyce of my wordes:
{34:17} May he be a ruler that loueth not right? or may he that is a very innocent man do vngodly?
{34:18} Is it reason that thou shouldest say to the king, Thou art wicked, or thou art vngodly, and that before the princes?
{34:19} God hath no respect vnto the persons of the lordly, and regardeth not the riche more then the poore: for they be al the worke of his handes.
{34:20} In the twinckling of an eye shall they dye, and at midnight when the people and the tirantes rage, then shall they perishe, & be taken away without handes.
{34:21} For his eyes loke vpon the wayes of man, and he seeth all his goinges.
{34:22} There is no darkenesse nor shadowe of death that can hide the wicked doers from him.
{34:23} For God wil not lay vpon man more then he hath sinned, that he should enter into iudgement with him.
{34:24} He shall destroy the mightie without seeking, and shall set other in their steede.
{34:25} Therefore shall he declare their workes: he shall turne the night, and they shalbe destroyed.
{34:26} The vngodly doth he punishe openly,
{34:27} Because they tourned backe from him, and would not consider all his wayes:
{34:28} Insomuch that they haue caused the voyce of the poore to come vnto him, and now he heareth the complaint of such as are in trouble.
{34:29} When he geueth quietnesse, who can make trouble? and when he hydeth his face, who can beholde him? whether it be vpon nations, or vpo one man onely:
{34:30} Because the hypocrite doth raigne, because the people are snared.
{34:31} Surely of God onely it can be saide, I haue pardoned, I wyll not destroy.
{34:32} If I haue gone amisse, enfourme thou me: If I haue done wrong, I wyll leaue of.
{34:33} Wyll he perfourme the thing through thee? for thou hast reproued his iudgement, thou also hast thyne owne minde, and not I: But speake on what thou knowest.
{34:34} Let men of vnderstanding tell me, and let a wyse man hearken vnto me.
{34:35} Iob hath not spoken of knowledge, neither were his wordes according to wysdome.
{34:36} O father, let Iob be well tryed, because he hath aunswered for wicked men:
{34:37} Yea aboue his sinne he doth wickedly, triumpheth among vs, and multiplieth his wordes against God.
{35:1} Elihu spake moreouer and saide:
{35:2} Thinkest thou it right that thou sayest, I am more righteous then God?
{35:3} For thou sayest: what aduauntage wyll it be vnto thee, and what profite shall I haue of my sinne?
{35:4} Therefore wyll I geue aunswere vnto thee, aud to thy companions with thee.
{35:5} Loke vnto the heauen and beholde it, consider the cloudes which are hyer then thou.
{35:6} If thou hast sinned, what hast thou done against him? If thyne offences be many, what hast thou done vnto him?
{35:7} If thou be righteous, what geuest thou him? or what wyll he receaue of thyne hande?
{35:8} Thy wickednesse may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righteousnesse may profite the sonne of man.
{35:9} They which are oppressed crye out vpon the multitude, yea they crye out for the power of the mightie:
{35:10} But none sayth, Where is God that made me? and that geueth vs occasion to praise him in the night?
{35:11} Which teacheth vs more the the beastes of the earth, and geueth vs more wysdome then the foules of heauen.
{35:12} If any such complaine, no man geueth aunswere, and that because of the wickednesse of proude tirauntes.
{35:13} For God wyll not heare vanitie, neither wyll the almightie regarde it.
{35:14} Although thou sayest to God thou wylt not regarde it: yet iudgement is before him, trust thou in him.
{35:15} But now because his anger hath not visited, neither called men to accompt with great extremitie:
{35:16} Therefore doth Iob open his mouth but in vaine, & he maketh many wordes without knowledge.
{36:1} Elihu also proceeded, and saide:
{36:2} Holde thee still a litle, & I shall shew thee what I haue yet to speake on gods behalfe.
{36:3} I wyll open vnto thee yet farre higher knowledge, and wil ascribe righteousnesse vnto my maker.
{36:4} And truely my wordes shall not be vaine, seeing he is with thee that is perfect in knowledge.
{36:5} Beholde, the great God casteth away no man, for he him selfe is mightie in power and wysdome.
{36:6} As for the vngodly he shall not preserue him, but shall helpe the poore to their right.
{36:7} He shal not turne his eyes away from the righteous, but as kinges shal they be in their throne, he shal stablish them for euer, and they shalbe exalted.
{36:8} But if they be layde in chaynes, or bounde with the bondes of trouble,
{36:9} Then wyll he shew them their worke, & their sinnes which haue ouercome them.
{36:10} He with punishing and nurturing of them, roundeth them in the eares, warneth them to leaue of from their wickednesse, and to amende.
{36:11} If they now wyll take heede & serue him, they shal weare out their dayes in prosperitie, and their yeres in pleasure.
{36:12} But if they wil not hearken, they shal go through the sworde, and perishe or euer they be aware.
{36:13} As for hypocrites in heart, they shall heape vp wrath for them selues for they call not vpon him, though they be his prisoners.
{36:14} Thus shal their soule perishe in foolishnes, and their lyfe among the fornicatours.
{36:15} The poore shall he deliuer out of his affliction, and rounde them in the eare when they be in trouble.
{36:16} Euen so would he take thee out of the straite place, into a brode place in the which there is no straitnes: yea, & make thy table quiet replenished with fatnesse.
{36:17} Neuerthelesse, thou hast commended the iudgement of the vngodly, and euen such a iudgement & sentence shalt thou suffer.
{36:18} And seeing there is wrath with God, beware lest he take thee away in thy wealth, & all that thou hast to redeeme thee can not deliuer thee.
{36:19} Thinkest thou that he wyll regarde thy riches? he shall not care for golde, nor for all them that excell in strength.
{36:20} Spend not the night in carefull thoughtes, how he destroyeth some, and bringeth other in their place.
{36:21} But beware that thou turne not aside to wickednesse and sinne, which hitherto thou hast chosen more then affliction.
{36:22} Beholde, God is of a mightie hie power: Where is there such a guide and lawe geuer as he?
{36:23} Who wyll reproue him of his way? Who wil say vnto him, Thou hast done wrong?
{36:24} Remember that thou do magnifie his worke which men do praise,
{36:25} All men see it, yea men do beholde it a farre of.
{36:26} Beholde, so great is God that he passeth our knowledge, neither can the number of his yeres be searched out.
{36:27} Sometime he restrayneth the rayne, and againe he sendeth rayne by his cloudes:
{36:28} Which rayne the cloudes do droppe, and let fall aboundantly vpon men.
{36:29} Who can consider the spreadinges out of his cloudes, the coueringes of his tabernacle?
{36:30} Behold, he doth stretch his light vpon it, and couereth the bottome of the sea.
{36:31} For by these gouerneth he his people, and geueth them aboundance of meate.
{36:32} With the cloudes he hydeth the light, and at his commaundement it breaketh out:
{36:33} Which dashing vpon the next cloudes, shew tokens of wrath.
{37:1} At this also my heart is astonied, and moued out of his place.
{37:2} Heare then the sounde of his voyce, & the noyse that goeth out of his mouth.
{37:3} He directeth it vnder the whole heauen, and his light vnto the endes of the worlde.
{37:4} A roring voyce foloweth it: for his glorious maiestie geueth a thuder clappe, & he will not stay whe his voyce is heard.
{37:5} God thundreth marueylously with his voyce, great thinges doth he which we can not comprehend.
{37:6} He commaundeth the snow, and it falleth vpon earth: he geueth the rayne a charge, and the showres haue their strength and fall downe.
{37:7} With the force of the rayne he shutteth men vp, that all men may knowe his workes.
{37:8} The beastes creepe into their dennes, and remaine in their places.
{37:9} Out of the south commeth the tempest, and colde out from the north winde.
{37:10} At the breath of God the hoare frost is geuen, and the brode waters are frosen.
{37:11} He maketh the cloudes to labour in geuing moystnesse, and againe with his light he dryueth away the cloude.
{37:12} He turneth the heauens about by his gouernement, that they may do whatsoeuer he commaundeth them vpon the whole worlde.
{37:13} Whether it be for punishment, or for his lande, or to do good to them that seeke him.
{37:14} Hearken vnto this O Iob, stand still, and consider the wonderous workes of God.
{37:15} Didst thou know when God disposed them? & caused the light of his cloudes to shine?
{37:16} Hast thou knowen the varietie of the cloudes, and the wonderous workes of him which is perfect in knowledge?
{37:17} And how thy clothes are warme, when the lande is stil through the south winde?
{37:18} Hast thou helped him to spreade out the heauens which are strong and bright as a loking glasse?
{37:19} Teache vs what we shall saye vnto him: for we are vnmeete to frame our talke because of darkenesse.
{37:20} Shall it be tolde him what I saye? Shall man speake when he shalbe destroyed?
{37:21} For men see not the light that shineth in the cloudes: but the winde passeth and cleanseth them.
{37:22} The faire weather commeth out of the north, the prayse thereof is to God who is terrible.
{37:23} It is the almightie, we can not finde him out: he is excellent in power and iudgement, and aboundaunt in iustice: he afflicteth not.
{37:24} Let men therefore feare him: for there shall no man see him that is wyse in his owne conceit.
{38:1} Then aunswered the Lorde vnto Iob out of the whirle winde, and saide:
{38:2} What is he that darkeneth his counsaile by wordes without knowledge?
{38:3} Girde vp thy loynes lyke a man: for I wyl question with thee, see thou geue me a direct aunswere.
{38:4} Where wast thou when I layed the foundations of the earth? Tell playnely, if thou hast vnderstanding.
{38:5} Who hath measured it, knowest thou? or who hath spread the lyne vpon it?
{38:6} Whereupon are the foundations set? or who layed the corner stone thereof?
{38:7} Where wast thou when the morning starres praysed me together, and all the children of God reioyced triumphantly?
{38:8} Who shut the sea with doores, when it brake foorth as out of the wombe?
{38:9} When I made the cloudes to be a covering for it, and swadled it with the darke:
{38:10} When I gaue it my commaundement, making doores and barres for it,
{38:11} Saying, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shalt thou laye downe thy proude and hie waues.
{38:12} Hast thou geue the morning his charge since thy dayes, and shewed the day spring his place,
{38:13} That it might take holde of the corners of the earth, and that the vngodly might be shaken out of it.
{38:14} They are fashioned as is the clay with the seale, and all stand vp as a garment.
{38:15} The vngodly shall be disapointed of their light, and the arme of the proude shalbe broken.
{38:16} Camest thou euer into the grounde of the sea, or walkedst in the lowe corners of the deepe?
{38:17} Haue the gates of death ben opened vnto thee? or hast thou seene the doores of the shadowe of death?
{38:18} Hast thou also perceaued how brode the earth is? If thou hast knowledge of all this:
{38:19} Then shewe me the way where light dwelleth, & where is the place of darkenesse?
{38:20} That thou shouldest receaue it in the boundes thereof, and know the pathes to their houses.
{38:21} Knewest thou afore thou wast borne how olde thou shouldest be?
{38:22} Wentest thou euer into the treasures of the snow, or hast thou seene the secrete places of the hayle,
{38:23} Which I haue prepared against the time of trouble, against the time of battaile and warre?
{38:24} By what way is the light parted? and into what land breaketh the east winde?
{38:25} Who deuideth the waters into diuers chanels? or who maketh a way for the lightening and thunder,
{38:26} To cause it to rayne on the earth where no man is, and in the wildernesse where none inhabiteth?
{38:27} To satisfie the desolate and waste grounde, and to cause the budde of the hearbe to spring foorth.
{38:28} Who is the father of the rayne? or who hath begotten the droppes of the deawe?
{38:29} Out of whose wombe came the yce? Who hath gendred the coldnesse of the ayre?
{38:30} That the waters are hidde as with a stone, and lye congealed aboue the deepe.
{38:31} Wylt thou hinder the sweete influences of the seuen starres? or loose the bandes of Orion?
{38:32} Canst thou bring foorth Mazzaroth in their time? canst thou also guide Arctutus with his sonnes?
{38:33} Knowest thou the course of heauen, that thou mayest set vp the ordinaunce thereof vpon the earth?
{38:34} Moreouer, canst thou lift vp thy voyce to the cloudes, that they may powre downe a great rayne vpon thee?
{38:35} Canst thou send the lightninges also, that they may go their way, and be obedient vnto thee, saying, Lo here are we?
{38:36} Who hath put wysdome in the reynes? or who hath geuen the heart vnderstanding?
{38:37} Who numbreth the cloudes in wysdome? who stilleth the vehement waters of the heauen?
{38:38} To cause the earth to grow into hardnesse, & the clots to cleaue fast together?
{38:39} Wylt thou hunt the pray for the lion? or fill the appetite of the lions whelpes,
{38:40} When they couche in their places, and tarie in the couert to lye in wayte?
{38:41} Who prouideth meate for the rauen, when his young ones crye vnto God, and flee about for lacke of meate?
{39:1} Knowest thou the time whe the wylde goates bring foorth their young among the stonye rockes? or layest thou wayte when the hindes vse to calue?
{39:2} Canst thou number the monethes that they go with young? or knowest thou the time when they bring foorth?
{39:3} They lye downe, they calue their young ones, and they are deliuered of their trauaile and paine:
{39:4} Yet their young ones grow vp, and waxe fatte through good feeding with corne: They go foorth, and returne not againe vnto them.
{39:5} Who letteth the wylde asse to go free? or who looseth the bondes of the wylde mule?
{39:6} Euen I which haue geuen the wyldernesse to be their house, and the vntilled land to be their dwelling.
{39:7} They force not for the multitude of people in the citie, neither regarde the crying of the driuer:
{39:8} But seeke their pasture about the mountaines, and folowe the greene grasse.
{39:9} Wyll the vnicorne do thee seruice, or abide still by thy cribbe?
{39:10} Canst thou binde the yoke about the vnicorne in the forowe, to make him plowe after thee in the valleyes?
{39:11} Mayst thou trust him because he is strong, or commit thy labour vnto him?
{39:12} Mayst thou beleue him that he wyll bring home thy corne, or carry any thing vnto thy barne?
{39:13} Gauest thou the faire winges vnto the pecockes, or winges and fethers vnto the Estriche?
{39:14} For she leaueth her egges in the earth, and heateth them in the dust.
{39:15} She remembreth not that they might be troden with feete, or broken with some wilde beaste.
{39:16} So harde is she vnto her young ones as though they were not hers, and laboureth in vaine without any feare.
{39:17} And that because God hath taken wysdome from her, & hath not geuen her vnderstanding.
{39:18} When her time is that she fleeth vp on hie, she careth neither for the horse nor the ryder.
{39:19} Hast thou geue the horse his strength, or learned him to ney coragiously?
{39:20} Canst thou make him afrayde as a grashopper? where as the stoute neying that he maketh is fearefull.
{39:21} He breaketh the grounde with the hooffes of his feete, he reioyceth cherefully in his strength, and runneth to meete the harnest men.
{39:22} He layeth aside all feare, his stomacke is not abated, neither starteth he backe for any sworde.
{39:23} Though the quiuers rattle vpon him, though the speare and shielde glister:
{39:24} Yet rusheth he in fiercely beating the grounde, he thinketh it not the noyse of the trumpettes:
{39:25} But when the trumpettes make most noyse, he saith, tushe, for he smelleth the battaile a farre of, the noyse of the captaines and the shouting.
{39:26} Commeth it through thy wysdome that the Goshauke flieth toward the south?
{39:27} Doth the Egle mount vp, and make his nest on hye at thy comaundement?
{39:28} He abydeth in stony rockes, and dwelleth vpon the hye toppes of moutaines:
{39:29} From whence he seeketh his praye, and loketh farre about with his eyes.
{39:30} His young ones also sucke vp blood: and where any dead body lyeth, there is he.
{40:1} Moreouer the Lorde spake vnto Iob, and saide:
{40:2} Shall he whom the almightie wyl chasten, contend with him? Should not he which disputeth with God, geue him an aunswere?
{40:3} Then Iob aunswered the Lorde, saying:
{40:4} Beholde, I am vyle, what shall I aunswere thee, therefore I wyll laye my hande vpon my mouth.
{40:5} Once haue I spoken, but I wyll saye no more: yea twyse, but I wyl proceede no further.
{40:6} Then aunswered the Lorde vnto Iob out of the whirle winde, and saide:
{40:7} Girde vp thy loynes now lyke a man: I wyll demaunde of thee, and make thou aunswere.
{40:8} Wylt thou disanul my iudgement? or wylt thou condempne me, that thou mayst be righteous?
{40:9} Is thy power then lyke the power of God? maketh thy voyce a sounde as his doth?
{40:10} Decke thy selfe now with excellencie and maiestie, and araye thy selfe with beautie and glory:
{40:11} Cast abrode the indignation of thy wrath, and beholde euery one that is proude, and abase him:
{40:12} Loke on euery one that is arrogant, and bring him lowe, & destroy the wicked in their place:
{40:13} Hide them in the dust together, and couer their faces in secrete:
{40:14} Then wyll I confesse vnto thee also, that thyne owne right hande shall saue thee.
{40:15} Beholde the beaste Behemoth, who I made with thee, which eateth haye as an oxe:
{40:16} Lo how his strength is in his loynes, and what power he hath in the nauil of his body.
{40:17} When he wyll, he spreadeth out his tayle lyke a Cedar tree, all his sinowes are stiffe.
{40:18} His bones are lyke pipes of brasse, yea his bones are lyke staues of iron.
{40:19} He is the chiefe of the wayes of God, he that made him wyl make his sword to approche vnto him.
{40:20} Surely the mountaines bring him foorth grasse, where all the beastes of the fielde take their pastime.
{40:21} He resteth him in the shade, in the couerte of the reede and fennes.
{40:22} The trees couer him with their shadowe, and the wyllowes of the brooke compasse him about.
{40:23} Beholde, he drinketh vp whole ryuers and feareth not, he thinketh that he can drawe vp Iordane into his mouth.
{40:24} He taketh it with his eyes, and yet the hunter putteth a bridle into his nose.
{41:1} (40:25) Canst thou drawe out Leuiathan with an hooke, or binde his tongue with a corde?
{41:2} (40:26) Canst thou put a hooke in the nose of him, or bore his iawe through with a naule?
{41:3} (40:27) Wyl he make many faire wordes with thee thinkest thou or flatter thee?
{41:4} (40:28) Wyll he make a couenaunt with thee? or wilt thou take him for a seruaunt for euer?
{41:5} (40:29) Wylt thou take thy pastime with him as with a birde, wilt thou binde him for thy maydens?
{41:6} (40:30) That thy companions may make a refection of him: or shall he be parted among the marchauntes?
{41:7} (40:31) Canst thou fil the basket with his skin? or the fishe panier with his head?
{41:8} (40:32) Laye thyne hande vpon him, remember the battaile, and do no more so.
{41:9} (40:33) Beholde his hope is in vaine: for shall not one perishe euen at the sight of him?
{41:10} (41:1) No man is so fierce that dare stirre him vp: Who is able to stande before me?
{41:11} (41:2) Or who hath geuen me any thyng aforehande, that I may rewarde him againe? All thinges vnder heauen are myne.
{41:12} (41:3) I wyll not keepe secrete his great strength, his power, nor his comely proportion.
{41:13} (41:4) Who can discouer the face of his garment? or who shall come to him with a double brydle?
{41:14} (41:5) Who shall open the doores of his face? for he hath horrible teeth round about.
{41:15} (41:6) His scales are as it were strong shieldes, so fastened together as if they were sealed:
{41:16} (41:7) One is so ioyned to another, that no ayre can come in:
{41:17} (41:8) Yea, one hangeth so vpon another, & sticketh so together, that they can not be sundred.
{41:18} (41:9) His neesinges make a glistering like fyre, and his eyes lyke the morning shine.
{41:19} (41:10) Out of his mouth go torches, and sparkes of fire leape out.
{41:20} (41:11) And out of his nostrels there goeth a smoke, lyke as out of an hotte seething pot, or caldron.
{41:21} (41:2) His breath maketh the coles burne, and the flambe goeth out of his mouth.
{41:22} (41:13) In his necke ther remaineth strength, and nothing is to labourous for him.
{41:23} (41:14) The members of his body are ioyned so strait one to another, and cleaue so fast together, that he cannot be moued.
{41:24} (41:5) His heart is as hard as a stone, and as fast as the stythie that the smyth smiteth vpon.
{41:25} (41:6) When he goeth the mightie are afraide, and feare troubleth them.
{41:26} (41:17) If any man drawe out a sword at him, it shall not hurt him: there may neither speare, laueling, nor brestplate abide him.
{41:27} (41:18) He setteth asmuch by iron as by a strawe, and asmuch by brasse as by a rotten sticke.
{41:28} (41:19) He starteth not away from him that bendeth the bowe: & as for sling stones he careth asmuch for stouble as for the.
{41:29} (41:20) He counteth the dartes no better then a strawe, he laugheth him to scorne that shaketh the speare.
{41:30} (41:21) Sharpe stones are vnder him lyke potsheardes, and he lyeth vpon sharpe thinges as vpon the soft myre.
{41:31} (41:22) He maketh the deepe to boyle lyke a pot, and stirreth the sea together lyke an oyntment.
{41:32} (41:23) He maketh the path to be seene after him, and he maketh the deepe to seeme all hoarie.
{41:33} (41:24) Upon earth there is no power lyke vnto his: for he is so made that he feareth not.
{41:34} (41:25) He beholdeth all the hye thinges, he is a king ouer all the children of pride.
{42:1} Then Iob aunswered the Lord, and saide:
{42:2} I know that thou hast power ouer all thinges, and that there is no thought hid vnto thee.
{42:3} For who can keepe his owne counsaile so secrete but it shalbe knowen? Therefore haue I spoken that I vnderstoode not, euen the thinges that are to wonderfull for me, and passe myne vnderstanding.
{42:4} O hearken thou vnto me also, and let me speake: aunswere vnto the thing that I wyll aske thee.
{42:5} I haue heard of thee by the hearing of the eare, but nowe myne eye seeth thee.
{42:6} Wherefore I geue myne owne selfe the blame, and take repentaunce in the dust and asshes.
{42:7} Now when the Lorde had spoken these wordes vnto Iob, it came to passe that the Lorde saide to Eliphas the Themanite: I am displeased with thee, and thy two friendes: for ye haue not spoken of me the thyng that is right, lyke as my seruaunt Iob hath done.
{42:8} Therefore take you now seuen oxen, and seuen rammes, and go to my seruaunt Iob, and offer vp for your selues a burnt offring, and my seruaunt Iob shall pray for you: him wyll I accept, and not deale with you after your foolishnesse, in that ye haue not spoken of me the thing which is right, lyke as my seruaunt Iob hath done.
{42:9} So Eliphas the Themanite, and Bildad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite, went and did according as the Lorde commaunded them: the Lorde also accepted the person of Iob,
{42:10} And the Lorde tourned the captiuitie of Iob when he prayed for his friendes: Yea the Lorde gaue Iob twyse as much as he had afore.
{42:11} And then came there vnto him all his brethren, all his sisters, and all they that had ben of his acquaintaunce afore, and did eate bread with him in his house, and had compassion on him, and comforted him ouer all trouble that the Lorde had brought vpon him: euery man also gaue him a certaine summe of money, and a iewell of golde.
{42:12} So the Lorde blessed the last dayes of Iob more then the first: for he had fourteene thousand sheepe, sixe thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses:
{42:13} He had seuen sonnes also, and three daughters.
{42:14} The first daughter called he Iemima, the second Kezia, and the third Kerenhapuch.
{42:15} In al the land were no women found so faire as the daughters of Iob: and their father gaue them inheritaunce among their brethren.
{42:16} After this liued Iob an hundred and fourtie yeres: so that he sawe his children, and his childrens children into the fourth generation.
{42:17} And so Iob dyed, being olde, and of a perfect age.
