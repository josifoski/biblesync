{1:1} And king Dauid was olde and stricken in yeres, so that whe they couered him with clothes, he caught no heate.
{1:2} Wherefore his seruauntes sayde vnto him: Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgyn, to stande before the king and to cherishe him, and let her lye in thy bosome, that my lorde the king may get heate.
{1:3} And so they sought for a faire damosell throughout al the coastes of Israel, and founde one Abisag a Sunamite, and brought her to the king.
{1:4} And the damosell was exceeding faire, and cherished the king, and ministred to him: But the king knewe her not.
{1:5} And Adonia the sonne of Haggith exalted him selfe, saying: I wilbe king. And he gat him charettes and horsemen, and fyftie men to runne before him.
{1:6} And his father for his time would not displease him, to say why hast thou done so? And he was a very goodly man: and his mother bare him next after Absalom.
{1:7} And he toke counsell at Ioab the sonne of Zaruia, and at Abiathar the priest: and they helped forward Adonia:
{1:8} But Sadoc the priest, Banaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, Nathan the prophete, Semei, and Rei, and the men of might which were with Dauid, they were not with Adonia.
{1:9} And Adonia sacrificed sheepe, and oxen, and fat cattel, by the stone of Zoheleth, whiche is by the well of Rogel, and called all his brethren the kinges sonnes, and all the men of Iuda the kinges seruauntes:
{1:10} But Nathan the prophete, and Banaiah, and the mightie men, and Solomon his brother he called not.
{1:11} Wherfore Nathan spake vnto Bethsabe the mother of Solomon, saying: Hast thou not hearde that Adonia the sonne of Haggith doth raigne, and Dauid our lorde knoweth it not?
{1:12} Nowe therfore come, and I will geue thee counsell howe to saue thyne owne lyfe, and the lyfe of thy sonne Solomon.
{1:13} Go and get thee in vnto king Dauid, & say vnto him: Diddest not thou my lorde O king, sweare vnto thy handmayde, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy sonne shall raigne after me, and he shall sit vpon my seate? why is then Adonia king?
{1:14} Beholde, whyle thou yet talkest there with the king, I wil come in after thee, and confirme thy wordes.
{1:15} And Bethsabe went in vnto the king into the chamber: And the king was very olde, and Abisag the Sunamite ministred vnto the king.
{1:16} And Bethsabe stouped & made obeysaunce vnto the king: And the king sayd, What is thy matter?
{1:17} She aunswered: My lorde, thou swarest by the Lorde thy God vnto thine handmayde saying Assuredly Solomon thy sonne shall raigne after me, and he shall sit vpon my seate.
{1:18} And beholde, nowe is Adonia king, and thou my lorde the king knowest it not.
{1:19} And he hath offered oxen, fat cattel, and many sheepe, and hath called all the sonnes of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Ioab the captayne of the hoast: But Solomon thy seruaunt hath he not bydden.
{1:20} And nowe my lorde O king, the eyes of all Israel wayte on thee, that thou shouldest tell them who ought to sit on the seate of my lord the king after him:
{1:21} For els when my lorde the king shall sleepe with his fathers, I & my sonne Solomon shalbe synners.
{1:22} And lo whyle she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came also.
{1:23} And they told the king, saying: Behold, here commeth Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in to the king, he made obeysaunce before the king vpo his face on the grounde.
{1:24} And Nathan sayde: My lord (O king) hast thou sayde, Adonia shall raigne after me, and he shall sit vpon my seate?
{1:25} For he is gone downe this day, & hath slayne oxen, & fat cattell, and sheepe a great meany, & hath called al the kinges sonnes, and the captaynes of the hoast, and Abiathar the priest: And beholde, they eate & drinke before him, and say: God saue king Adonia.
{1:26} But me thy seruaunt, and Sadoc the priest, and Banaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, & thy seruaunt Solomon, hath he not called.
{1:27} Is this thing done of my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it vnto thy seruaunt who should sit on the seate of my lorde the king after him?
{1:28} Then king Dauid aunswered, & sayd: Cal me Bethsabe. And she came into the kinges presence, and stoode before him.
{1:29} And the king sware, saying: As the Lord lyueth that hath ryd my soule out of all aduersite,
{1:30} Euen as I sware vnto thee by the Lord God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy sonne shal raigne after me, & he shal sit vpon my seate for me: so will I certeinly do this day.
{1:31} Then Bethsabe bowed on her face to the earth, and dyd reuerence vnto the king, & sayde: I pray God that my lorde king Dauid may lyue for euer.
{1:32} And king Dauid sayde: Call me Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaiah the sonne of Iehoiada. And they came before the king.
{1:33} The king also sayde vnto them: Take with you the seruauntes of your lord, & set Solomo my sonne vpon myne owne mule, and cary him downe to Gihon:
{1:34} And let Sadoc the priest and Nathan the prophet annoynt him there king ouer Israel: And blowe ye with trumpettes, & say, God saue king Solomon.
{1:35} And then ye shall come vp after him, that he may come and sit vpo my seate, for he shalbe king in my steade: and I haue commaunded him to be captayne ouer Israel and Iuda.
{1:36} And Banaiah the sonne of Iehoiada aunswered the king, and sayde, Amen: And the Lord God of my lorde the king say so to.
{1:37} And as the Lorde hath ben with my lord the king, eue so be he with Solomo also, and make his seate greater then the seate of my lord king Dauids hath ben.
{1:38} And so Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and the Cerethites, and Phelethites went downe, and set Solomon vpon king Dauids mule, and brought him to Gihon.
{1:39} And Sadoc the priest toke an horne of oyle out of the tabernacle, & annoynted Solomon: And they blew the trumpettes, and al the people sayde: God saue king Solomon.
{1:40} And all the people came vp after him, pyping with pypes and reioysing greatly, so that the earth rang with the sounde of them.
{1:41} And Adonia and al the ghestes that he had called vnto him, hearde it euen as they had made an ende of eating. And when Ioab hearde the sounde of the trumpet, he sayde: What meaneth this noyse and vprore in the citie?
{1:42} And as he yet spake, beholde Ionathan the sonne of Abiathar the priest came, and Adonia said vnto him: Come in, for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tydinges.
{1:43} And Ionathan aunswered and sayde to Adonia: Ueryly our lorde king Dauid hath made Solomon king.
{1:44} And the king hath sent with him Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, & the Cerethites, and the Phelethites, & they haue set him vpo the kinges mule.
{1:45} And Sadoc the priest & Nathan the prophete, haue annoynted him king in Gihon. And they came vp from thence, & reioyced, that the citie did sounde againe: And that is the noyse, that ye haue hearde.
{1:46} And Solomon sitteth on the seate of the kingdome.
{1:47} And moreouer, the kinges seruauntes came to blesse our lorde king Dauid, saying: God make the name of Solomo more honorable then thy name, & make his seate greater then thy seate. And the king bowed him selfe vpon the bed.
{1:48} And thus sayd the king: Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which hath made one to sit on my seate this day, myne eye seyng it.
{1:49} And al the ghestes that were with Adonia were afrayde, and rose vp, & went euery man his way.
{1:50} And Adonia fearing the presence of Solomon, arose, and went and caught hold on the hornes of the aulter.
{1:51} And one tolde Solomon, saying: Behold, Adonia feareth king Solomon: for lo he hath caught hold on the hornes of the aulter, saying: Let king Solomon sweare vnto me this day that he wil not slay his seruaunt with the sword.
{1:52} And Solomo said: If he wil shew him selfe a worthy ma, ther shal not an heer of hym fal to the earth: But & if wickednesse be founde in him, he shall dye.
{1:53} And so king Solomon sent, and they brought him from the aulter, and he came and did obeysaunce vnto king Solomon: And Solomon sayde vnto him, Get thee to thyne house.
{2:1} The dayes of Dauid drew nie that he should dye, & he charged Solomon his sonne, saying:
{2:2} I go the way of al the earth, be thou strong therfore, & shewe thy selfe a man.
{2:3} Kepe thou the watch of the Lorde thy God, that thou walke in his wayes, and kepe his statutes, and his preceptes, his iudgementes, and his testimonies, euen as it is written in the lawe of Moyses: that thou mayst prosper in all that thou doest, and in euery thing that thou medlest withall.
{2:4} That the Lorde also may make good his worde which he spake vnto me, saying: If thy children take heede to their way, that they walke before me in trueth, with all their heartes, & with al their soules, thou shalt not (saith he) be without a man on the seate of Israel.
{2:5} Moreouer, thou wottest howe Ioab the sonne of Zaruia serued me, and what he did to the two captaynes of the hoastes of Israel, vnto Abner the sonne of Ner, and vnto Amasa the sonne of Iether, whom he slue, and shed blood in time of peace (euen as it had ben in warre) & put the blood of warre vpon his girdle that was about his loynes, and in his shoes that were on his feete.
{2:6} Deale with him therefore according to thy wisdome, and bring not his hoore head downe to the graue in peace.
{2:7} But shewe kindnes vnto the sonnes of Barzellai ye Gileadite, that they may eate at thy table: For they came to me whe I fled from Absalom thy brother.
{2:8} And behold, thou hast with thee Semei the sonne of Gera the sonne of Iemini of Bahurim, whiche cursed me with an horrible curse, in the day when I went to Mahanaim: But he came to meete me at Iordane, & I sware to him by the Lord, saying: I wil not slay thee with the sworde.
{2:9} But thou shalt not count him as vngiltie: For thou art a man of wisdome, and knowest what thou oughtest to do vnto him, his hoore head shalt thou bring to the graue with blood.
{2:10} And so Dauid slept with his fathers, and was buried in the citie of Dauid.
{2:11} And the dayes whiche Dauid raigned vpon Israel were fourtie yeres: seuen yeres raigned he in Hebron, & thirtie and three yeres raigned he in Hierusalem.
{2:12} Then sate Solomon vpon the seate of Dauid his father, and his kingdome was stablished mightyly.
{2:13} And Adonia the sonne of Haggith came to Bethsabe the mother of Solomon, and she sayde: Comest thou peaceably? And he sayde, peaceably.
{2:14} He sayde moreouer: I haue somwhat to say vnto thee. She sayd: Say on.
{2:15} And he sayd: Thou knowest that the kingdome was myne, & that all Israel set their faces on me, that I shoulde raigne: howbeit, the kingdome is turned away, and geuen to my brother: for it is appoynted him of the Lorde.
{2:16} And nowe I aske a petition of thee, deny me not. And she sayde vnto him: Say on.
{2:17} And he said: Speake I pray thee, vnto Solomo the king (for he wil not say thee nay) that he geue me Abisag the Sunamite to wyfe.
{2:18} And Bethsabe sayd: Wel, I wil speake for thee vnto the king.
{2:19} Bethsabe therfore went vnto king Solomon, to speake vnto him for Adonia: And the king rose vp to meete her, and bowed him selfe vnto her, and sate hym downe on his seate, & there was a seate set for the kinges mother, & she sate on his right syde.
{2:20} Then she sayd: I desire a litle petition of thee, I pray thee say me not nay. And the king sayd vnto her: Aske on, my mother, for I wil not say thee nay.
{2:21} She sayde: Let Abisag the Sunamite be geuen to Adonia thy brother to wyfe.
{2:22} And king Solomon aunswered and sayde vnto his mother: Why doest thou aske Abisag the Sunamite for Adonia? aske for him the kingdome also: for he is myne elder brother, and hath for him Abiathar the priest, and Ioab the sonne of Zaruia.
{2:23} Then king Solomon sware by the Lord, saying: God do so and so to me, if Adonia haue not spoken this worde against his owne lyfe.
{2:24} Nowe therefore, as the Lorde lyueth, whiche hath ordeyned me, and set me on the seate of Dauid my father, and made me an house as he promised, Adonia shall dye this day.
{2:25} And king Solomon sent by the hande of Banaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and he smote him that he died.
{2:26} And vnto Abiathar the priest sayd the king: Get thee to Anatoth vnto thine owne fieldes, for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time kill thee, because thou barest the arke of the Lorde God before Dauid my father, and because thou hast suffered with my father in all his afflictions.
{2:27} And so Solomon put away Abiathar from beyng priest vnto the Lord: that he might fulfill the wordes of the Lord, which he spake ouer the house of Eli in Silo.
{2:28} Then tydinges came also to Ioab (for Ioab had turned after Adonia, though he turned not after Absalom) and Ioab fled vnto the tabernacle of the Lorde, and caught holde on the hornes of the aulter.
{2:29} And it was told king Solomon howe that Ioab fled vnto the tabernacle of the Lorde, and beholde he is by the aulter: Then Solomon sent Banaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, saying: Go and fall vpon him.
{2:30} And Banaiah came to the tabernacle of the Lorde, and sayde vnto him: Thus sayeth the king, Come out. And he sayde: Nay, but I wil dye euen here. And Banaiah brought the king word againe, saying: Thus sayde Ioab, and thus he aunswered me.
{2:31} And the king sayde vnto him, Do euen as he hath sayd: Smite him, & burie him, that thou mayest take away the blood which Ioab shed causelesse, from me, and from the house of my father.
{2:32} And the Lorde shall bring his blood vpon his owne head: for he smote two men righteouser and better then he, and slue them with the sworde, my father Dauid not knowing therof, euen Abner the sonne of Ner captayne of the hoast of Israel, and Amasa the sonne of Iether captayne of the hoast of Iuda.
{2:33} Their blood shal therfore returne vpon the head of Ioab, & on the head of his seede for euer: But vpon Dauid, & vpon his seed, & vpon his house, & vpo his seat shall there be peace for euer of the Lord.
{2:34} So Banaiah the sonne of Iehoiada went vp, & he fel vpon him and slue him, and buried him in his house in the wildernesse.
{2:35} And the king put Banaiah the sonne of Iehoiada in his roome ouer ye hoast, and put Sadoc the priest in the roome of Abiathar.
{2:36} And the king sent and called Semei, & sayde vnto him: Buylde thee an house in Hierusalen, and dwell there, & see that thou go not foorth thence any whyther.
{2:37} For be thou sure, that the day that thou goest out, and passest ouer the riuer of Cedron, thou shalt dye that day, and thy blood shalbe vpon thyne owne head.
{2:38} And Semei sayde vnto the king, This saying is good: As my lorde ye king hath sayde, so will thy seruaunt do. And Semei dwelt in Hierusalem many a day.
{2:39} And it chaunced after three yeres, that two of the seruauntes of Semei ranne away vnto Achis sonne of Maacha king of Geth: And they told Semei, saying, Behold, thy seruauntes be in Geth.
{2:40} And Semei stoode vp, and sadled his asse, and gat him to Geth to Achis to seke his seruauntes: And Semei wet & brought his seruauntes againe from Geth.
{2:41} And it was tolde Solomon, howe that Semei had gone from Hierusalem to Geth, and was come againe.
{2:42} And the king sent & called Semei, and said vnto him: Did I not charge thee by the Lorde with an oth, & testified vnto thee, saying: Be sure, that whensoeuer thou goest out & walkest abroade any whyther, thou shalt bye the death? And thou saydest vnto me: It is good tydinges that I haue heard.
{2:43} Why then hast thou not kept the oth of the Lorde, and the commaundement that I charged thee withall?
{2:44} The king sayde moreoeur to Semei: Thou remembrest all the wickednesse which thyne heart knoweth, and that thou diddest to Dauid my father: the Lorde also shall bring thy wickednesse vpon thyne owne head:
{2:45} And king Solomon shalbe blessed, and the seate of Dauid stablished before the Lorde for euer.
{2:46} So the king commaunded Banaiah the sonne of Iehoiada: which went out, and smote him that he died: And the kingdome was stablished in the hande of Solomon.
{3:1} Solomon made affinitie with Pharao king of Egypt, & toke Pharaos daughter, and brought her into the citie of Dauid, vntil he had made an ende of buylding his owne house, and the house of the Lorde, and the wall of Hierusalem round about.
{3:2} Onely the people sacrificed in hygh places, because there was no house built vnto the name of the Lorde vntill those dayes.
{3:3} And Solomon loued the Lorde, walking in the ordinaunces of Dauid his father: saue onely that he sacrificed and offered incense vpon aulters in hygh places.
{3:4} And the king went to Gibeon, to offer there, for that was the speciall hygh place: And a thousande burnt offringes dyd Solomon offer vpon that aulter.
{3:5} And in Gibeon the Lorde appeared to Solomon in a dreame by night, and God sayd: Aske what thou wilt, that I may geue it thee.
{3:6} And Solomon sayde: Thou hast shewed vnto thy seruaut Dauid my father great mercie, when he walked before thee in trueth, in righteousnesse, and in plainnesse of heart with thee, and thou hast kept for him this great mercy, that thou hast geuen him a sonne to sit on his seate, as it is come to passe this day.
{3:7} And nowe O Lord my God, it is thou that hast made thy seruaunt king in steade of Dauid my father: And I am but young, & wote not howe to go out and in.
{3:8} And thy seruaunt is in the middest of thy people which thou hast chosen: and veryly the people are so many, that they cannot be told nor nubred for multitude.
{3:9} Geue therfore thy seruaunt an vnderstanding heart to iudge thy people, that I may discerne betweene good & bad: For who is able to iudge this thy so mightie a people?
{3:10} And this pleased the Lorde well that Solomon had desired this thing,
{3:11} And God sayde vnto him: Thou hast not asked for thy selfe long lyfe, neither hast asked riches for thy selfe, nor hast asked the lyfe of thy enemies, but hast asked for thy selfe vnderstanding & discretion in iudgement:
{3:12} Behold, I haue done according to thy wordes, lo I haue geuen thee a wyse & an vnderstanding heart, so that there was none lyke thee before thee, neither after thee shal any aryse lyke vnto thee.
{3:13} And I haue also geuen thee that which thou hast not asked, euen rychesse and honour, so that ther shalbe no king lyke vnto thee all thy dayes.
{3:14} And if thou wilt walke in my wayes, to kepe myne ordinaunces and my commaundementes, as thy father Dauid dyd walke, I will lengthen thy dayes.
{3:15} When Solomon awoke, beholde it was a dreame: And he came to Hierusalem and stoode before the arke of the couenaunt of the Lorde, & offred burnt offringes and peace offringes, and made a feast to all his seruauntes.
{3:16} Then came there two women that were harlottes, vnto the king, & stoode before him.
{3:17} And the one woman sayde: Oh my lorde, I and this woman dwell in one house, and I was deliuered of a childe, with her in the house:
{3:18} And the thirde day after that I was deliuered, she was deliuered also: and we were together, & no straunger with vs in the house, saue we two.
{3:19} And this wiues childe died in the night, for she smothered it.
{3:20} And she rose at midnight and toke my sonne from my syde while thyne handmayde slept, and layde it in her bosome, and put her dead childe in my bosome.
{3:21} And when I rose in the mornyng to geue my chylde sucke, beholde it was dead: But when I had loked vpon it in the morning, beholde, it was not my sonne which I dyd beare.
{3:22} And the other woman sayd: It is not so, but my sonne liueth, and thy sonne is dead. And she sayde againe: No, but thy sonne is dead, and my sonne is alyue. And thus they pleaded before the king.
{3:23} Then sayde the king: The one sayth, this that is alyue is my sonne, and the dead is thyne: And the other sayth, nay: but thy sonne is the dead, and the liuing childe is myne.
{3:24} And the king sayde: Bring me a sworde. And they brought out a sworde before the king.
{3:25} And the king sayde: Deuide the liuing child in two, and geue the one halfe to the one, aud the other to the other.
{3:26} Then spake the woman whose the liuing childe was, vnto the king (for her bowelles yerned vpon her sonne) and sayde: I besech thee my lorde geue her the liuing childe, and in no wyse slay it: But the other sayde, Let it be neither myne nor thyne, but deuide it.
{3:27} Then the king aunswered and sayde: Geue her the liuing childe, and slay it not, for she is the mother therof.
{3:28} And all they of Israel hearde of the iudgement which the king had iudged, and feared the king: for they sawe that the wysdome of God was in him to do iustice.
{4:1} And so king Solomon was king ouer all Israel.
{4:2} And these were his lordes: Azariahu the sonne of Sadoc the priest.
{4:3} Elihozeph and Ahiah the sonnes of Sisa, scribes: Iehosaphat the sonne of Ahilud, the recorder.
{4:4} Banaiah the sonne of Iehoiada was ouer the hoast: Sadoc and Abiathar were the priestes.
{4:5} And Azariahu the sonne of Nathan was ouer the officers: And Zabud the sonne of Nathan was a priest, ye kinges companion.
{4:6} And Ahisar was steward of ye houshold: And Adoniram the sonne of Abda was ouer the tributes.
{4:7} And Solomon had twelue officers ouer all Israel, which prouided vittayles for the king and his houshold: eche man his moneth in a yere, made prouision for necessarie thinges.
{4:8} And these are their names: the sonne of Hur in mount Ephraim,
{4:9} The sonne of Dekar in Makaz and in Saalbin, and Bethsames, Elon, and Bethhanan.
{4:10} The sonne of Hesed in Aruboth, to whom parteyned Socho and all the land of Hepher.
{4:11} The sonne of Abinadab in all the region of Dor, whiche had Tapheth the daughter of Solomon to wyfe.
{4:12} Baana the sonne of Ahilud was ouer Thaanach and Megiddo, and ouer all Bethsan, whiche is by Zarthana beneath Iezrael, fro Bethsan to ye plaine of Mehola, euen vnto the place that is ouer against Iecmeam.
{4:13} The sonne of Gaber had Ramoth Gilead, and his were the townes of Iair the sonne of Manasse which are in Gilead: and vnder him was the region of Argob whiche is in Basan threescore great cities with walles and barres of brasse.
{4:14} Ahinadab the sonne of Hiddo had Mahenaim.
{4:15} Ahimaaz was in Nephthalim, and he toke Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wyfe.
{4:16} Baana the sonne of Husai was in Aser and in Aloth.
{4:17} Iehosaphat the sonne of Paruah was in Isachar.
{4:18} Semei the sonne of Ela was in Beniamin.
{4:19} Gaber the sonne of Uri was in the countrey of Gilead, the land of Sehon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Basan, & was officer alone in the lande.
{4:20} And Iuda and Israel were many euen as the sande of the sea in numbre, eating, drincking, and making mery.
{4:21} And Solomon raigned ouer all kingdomes from the riuer vnto the lande of the Philistines, euen vnto the border of Egypt: and they brought presentes, and serued Solomon al the dayes of his life.
{4:22} And Solomons bread for one day was thirtie quarters of manchet flowre, & threescore quarters of meale:
{4:23} Ten stalled oxen, and twentie out of the pastures, and a hundred sheepe, beside hartes, buckes, and wilde goates, and capons.
{4:24} For he ruled in all the region on the other syde Euphrates, from Thiphsah to Azza, ouer al the kinges on the other syde the riuer: And he had peace with all his seruauntes on euery syde.
{4:25} And Iuda and Israel dwelt without feare, euery man vnder his vine and vnder his figgetree, from Danto Beerseba all the dayes of Solomon.
{4:26} And Solomon had fourtie thousand stalles of horses for charettes, & twelue thousande horsemen.
{4:27} And the officers prouided vittayle for king Solomon and for all that came out of any place to king Solomons table, euery man his moneth, so that they lacked nothing.
{4:28} Barly also and strawe for the horses and mules brought they vnto the place where the officers were, euery man in his office.
{4:29} And God gaue Solomon wysdome and vnderstanding exceeding much, and a large heart, euen as the sand that is on the sea shore.
{4:30} And Solomons wysdome excelled the wysedome of all the children of the east countrey, and al the wisdome of Egypt.
{4:31} For he was wiser then al men, yea then Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Chalcol, and Darda the sonnes of Mahol: And his name was spoken of throughout all nations on euery syde.
{4:32} And Solomon spake three thousande prouerbes: And his songes were a thousande and fiue.
{4:33} And he spake of trees, euen from the Cedar tree that groweth in Libanon, vnto the Isope that springeth out of the wall: He spake also of beastes, of foules, of wormes, and of fishes.
{4:34} And there came of all nations to heare the wysdome of Solomon, and from all kinges of the earth, which had heard of his wysdome.
{5:1} And Hira king of Tyre sent his seruauntes vnto Solomon (for he had hearde that they had annoynted him king in the roome of his father) For Hira was euer a louer of Dauid.
{5:2} And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying:
{5:3} Thou knowest howe that Dauid my father could not buyld an house vnto the name of the Lorde his God for the warres which were about him on euery syde, vntill the Lorde put them vnder the soles of his feete.
{5:4} But now the Lorde my God hath geuen me rest on euery syde, so that there is neither aduersarie nor euill to resist.
{5:5} And beholde, I am determined to build an house vnto ye name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spake vnto Dauid my father, saying: Thy sonne whom I wil set vpon thy seate for thee, he shal build an house vnto my name.
{5:6} Now therefore commaund thou that they hewe me Cedar trees out of Libanon, & my seruautes shalbe with thyne, and vnto thee wyll I geue the hyre for thy seruauntes, accordyng to all such thinges as thou shalt appoynt: for thou knowest that there are not among vs that can skyl to hewe tymber, lyke vnto the Sidones.
{5:7} And it came to passe, when Hiram heard ye wordes of Solomo, he reioysed greatly, & said: Blessed be the Lord this day, which hath geuen vnto Dauid a wyse sonne ouer this mightie people.
{5:8} And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: I haue considered the thinges which thou sentest to me for, & wyl accomplishe all thy desyre concerning tymber of Cedar trees and firre.
{5:9} My seruauntes shall bring them from Libanon to the sea, and I wyl conuey them by sea in flootes vnto the place that thou shalt shew me, and wil cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receaue them: and thou shalt do me a pleasure againe, if thou minister foode for myne house.
{5:10} Aud so Hiram gaue Solomon Cedar trees and firre trees according to all his desyre.
{5:11} And Solomon gaue Hiram twentie thousand quarters of wheate for foode to his housholde, and twentie buts of pure oyle: Thus much gaue Solomon to Hiram yere by yere.
{5:12} And the Lorde gaue Solomon wisedome as he promysed him: And there was peace betweene Hiram and Solomon, & they two were consedered together.
{5:13} And king Solomon raysed a summe out of Israel, and the summe was thirtie thousand men:
{5:14} Whom he sent to Libanon, ten thousand a moneth by course: so that when they had ben one moneth in Libanon, they abode two monethes at home: And Adoniram was ouer the summe.
{5:15} And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and foure score thousand masons in the mountaines:
{5:16} Besides the lordes whom Solomon appoynted to ouersee the worke, euen three thousand & three hundred, which ruled the people & them that wrought in the worke.
{5:17} And the king commaunded them to bring great stones, costly stones, & hewed stones, for the foundatio of the house.
{5:18} And Solomons masons, and the masons of Hiram did hewe them, and the stone squarers: And so they prepared both tymber and stones, for the building of the house.
{6:1} And it came to passe, that in the foure hundred & fourescore yere, after the childre of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, and in the fourth yere of the rayne of Solomon vpon Israel, & in the moneth Zif, which is the second moneth, he began to build the house of the Lorde.
{6:2} And the house which king Solomon built for the Lorde, was threescore cubites long, and twentie cubites broade, and thirtie cubites hie.
{6:3} And he made a porche before the temple of the house, which was twentie cubites long, after ye breadth of the house, and ten cubites brode, euen in the fore front of the house.
{6:4} And in the house he made windowes, broade without, and narow within.
{6:5} And by the wall of the house he made chambers round about euen in the walles of the house round about the temple & the quier: and he made chambers round about.
{6:6} The neathermost chamber was fiue cubites broade, & the middle was sixe cubites broade, & the third was seuen cubites broade: For without in the wall of the house he made restes round about that the beames of the chambers shoulde not be fastened in ye walles of the house.
{6:7} And the house was built of stone, made perfect alredye before it was brought thyther: so that there was neither hammer nor axe, either any toole of iron heard in the house while it was in buylding.
{6:8} The doore of the middle chamber was in the ryght syde of the house: and men went vp with wineding stayres into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.
{6:9} And so he built the house, and finished it: and he roofed the house vaultly with beames of Cedar tymber.
{6:10} And then he built chambers to all the temple fiue cubites heyght, & they were ioyned to the house with beames of Cedar.
{6:11} And the word of the Lorde came to Solomon, saying:
{6:12} Concerning the house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walke in myne ordinaunces, and execute my lawes, and kepe all my commaundementes to walke in them: then wyll I make good vnto thee my promise which I promysed Dauid thy father:
{6:13} And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
{6:14} Solomon therefore built the house, and finished it.
{6:15} And seeled the walles of the house within with boordes of Cedar tree: euen fro the pauement of the house vnto the roofe did he seele the walles of it within with Cedar tree: and boorded the floore of the house with planckes of firre.
{6:16} And he builded twentie cubites in the sydes of the quier of the temple both floore & walles with boordes of Cedar: and dressed it within the secret place of the temple, euen in the most holy.
{6:17} But the house, that is the temple before it, was fourtie cubites long.
{6:18} And the Cedar of the house within, was carued with knoppes, and grauen with flowres: & all was Cedar timber, so that no stone was sene.
{6:19} And the quier that was within the temple he prepared, to set there the arke of the appoyntment of the Lorde.
{6:20} And the quier before was twentie cubites long, & twentie cubites in breadth, and twentie cubites in height: And he couered it with pure golde, and boorded the aulter with Cedar.
{6:21} So Solomon couered the house within with pure golde: And he made golde barres runne along the quier, which he had couered with golde.
{6:22} And the whole house he ouerlayde with golde vntil he had ended it: also al the aulter that was in the quier he ouerlayde with golde.
{6:23} And within the quier he made two Cherubims of Oliue tree ten cubites hie.
{6:24} Fiue cubites long was a wing of the one Cherub, & fiue cubites long was a wing of the other Cherub: so that from the vttermost part of one wing, vnto the vttermost part of the other, were ten cubites.
{6:25} And the other Cherub was ten cubites hie also: so that both the Cherubs were of one measure, and one sise:
{6:26} For the height of the one Cherub was ten cubites, and so was it of the other.
{6:27} And he put the Cherubs within the inner house: And the Cherubs stretched out their winges, so that the one wing of the one touched the one wall, and the one wing of the other touched the other wall: And the other two winges of them touched one another in the middest of the house.
{6:28} And he ouerlayde the Cherubs with golde.
{6:29} And in all the walles of ye house round about, he made figures of carued & seeled worke: as namely pictures of Cherubs, & paulme trees, & grauen flowres, both within in the quier and without in the temple.
{6:30} And the floore of the house he couered with golde, both within in the quier and also without in the temple.
{6:31} And in the entering of the quier, he made two doores of Oliue tree: And both the vpper & two side postes were fiue square.
{6:32} The two doores also were of oliue tree, & he graued them with grauing of Cherubs and paulme trees and grauen flowres, & couered them with golde, & layde thinne plates of golde vpon the Cherubs and paulme trees.
{6:33} And so made he for the doore of the temple, postes of Oliue tree foure square.
{6:34} The two doores were of firre tree, and either doore with foulding leaues.
{6:35} And he graued thereon Cherubs, paulme trees, & carued flowres: and couered the carued worke with golde finelie wrought.
{6:36} And he built the inner court with three rowes of hewed stone, and one rowe of Cedar wood.
{6:37} In the fourth yere was the foundation of the house of the Lorde layde, euen in the moneth Zif.
{6:38} And in the leuenth yere, in the moneth Bul (which is the eyght moneth) was the house full finished throughout all the partes thereof, according to all the fashion of it: And so was he seuen yeres in building it.
{7:1} But Solomon was buildinge his owne house thirteene yeres, and finished it all.
{7:2} And he built ye house in the wood Libanon, an hundred cubites long, and fiftie cubites broade, and thirtie cubites hie: And it stoode vpon foure rowes of Cedar pillers, and Cedar beames were layde vpon the pillers.
{7:3} And the roofe was Cedar aboue vpon the beames that laye on the pillers, euen 45 beames in fifteene rowes.
{7:4} And there were windowes in three rowes, and the windowes were one against another three folde.
{7:5} And al the doores with the syde postes & the vpper postes were foure square, and had windowes one against another three folde.
{7:6} And he made a porche by the pillers that bare vp the house fiftie cubites long, and thirtie cubites broade, and the porche was before those and the other pillers: for there was a thicke tree set before them.
{7:7} Then he made a porche to sit & iudge in, euen a porche of iudgmet, seeled with Cedar throughout all the pauementes.
{7:8} And his house wherein he dwelt had an other hall, more inward then the porche, of lyke worke: And then Solomo made an house for Pharaos daughter ( whom he had taken to wyfe) lyke vnto the fashion of the porche.
{7:9} And all these were of the best stones, hewed after a measure and sawed with sawes within and without, from the foundation vnto the beames that laye aboue, after the measure, and euen so on the out syde toward the great court.
{7:10} And the foundation was layde vpon rich stones, and that very great stones, whereof some were ten cubites, and some eyght cubites.
{7:11} And aboue were riche stones, squared after a certayne rule, and couered with Cedar.
{7:12} And the great court round about, was with three rowes of hewed stones, and one rowe of Cedar planckes, after the maner of the inner court of the house of the Lorde, and of the porche of the temple.
{7:13} And king Solomon sent and fet one Hiram out of Tyre,
{7:14} A widowes sonne of ye tribe of Nephthalim, his father being a man of Tyre: Which Hiram was a craftesman in brasse, ful of wisedome, vnderstanding, and cunning, to worke all maner of worke in brasse: And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his worke.
{7:15} For he cast two pillers of brasse of eyghteene cubites hie a peece: & a string of twelue cubites did compasse either of them about.
{7:16} And he made two pommels of moulten brasse, after the fashion of a crowne, to set on the toppes of the pillers: The height of the one head peece contayned fiue cubites, and the height of the other head peece contayned fiue cubites also.
{7:17} He made networke, & wrythen worke like chaines for the pommels vpon the head peeces that were on the top of the pillers: euen seuen rowes vpon the one head peece, and seuen vpon the other.
{7:18} And so he made the pillers, and two rowes of pomegranets rounde about in the one networke to couer the pommels that were vpon the top: and this he did also, for the other head peece.
{7:19} And the pommels that were on the top of the pillers, were after lillie worke in the porche foure cubites.
{7:20} And the pommels vpon the two pillers had also aboue ouer against the middest within the networke: pomegranets and vpon the second head peece were there two hundred pomegranets in two rowes round about.
{7:21} And he set vp the pillers in the porch of the temple: And when he had set vp the right piller, he called the name therof Iachin: and when he had set vp the left piller, he called the name thereof Boaz.
{7:22} And vpon the top of the pillers were lillie worke: & so was the workmanship of the pillers finished.
{7:23} And he made a moulten lauatorie ten cubites wide from brim to brim, round in compasse, and fiue cubites hie: And a string of thirtie cubites did compasse it about.
{7:24} And vnder the brim of it there were knoppes round about, ten in one cubite, and thei compassed the lauatorie round about: And the knoppes were cast with it in two rowes when it was cast.
{7:25} And it stoode on twelue oxen, of which three loked toward the north, three toward the west, three toward the south, and three toward the east: and the lauatorie stoode vpon them, and al their hinder partes were inward.
{7:26} It was an hand breadth thicke, and the brym was wrought lyke the brym of a cup with flowres of lilies, and it contained two thousand battes.
{7:27} And he made ten feete of brasse: foure cubites long, and foure cubites broade a peece, and three cubites hie.
{7:28} And the worke of the feete was on this maner: They had sides, and the sides were betweene the ledges.
{7:29} And on the sides that were betweene the ledges, were lions, oxen, and Cherubs: and likewise vpo the ledges that were aboue: and beneath the lions and oxen, were certayne additions made of thynne worke.
{7:30} And vnder euery foote were foure brasen wheeles, and boordes of brasse: and in the foure corners thereof vnder the lauatorie, were vndersetters moulten at the side of euery addition.
{7:31} And the stalke of the lauatorie was in the middle of it, and aboue one cubite: But the stalke thereof was round after the worke of the foote, a cubite & a halfe: and also vpon the stalke were grauings with their bands, foure square and not round.
{7:32} And vnder the sydes were foure wheeles, and the axeltrees ioyned fast to the bottome, and the height of euery wheele was a cubite and an halfe.
{7:33} And the workmanship of the wheeles was lyke the worke of a charet wheele: and the axeltrees, the nauelles, spokes, and shaftes, were al moulten.
{7:34} And there were foure vndersetters in the foure corners of one foote, & the vndersetters were of ye very bottome selfe.
{7:35} And in the height of the bottome was there a rounde compasse of halfe a cubite hie: and in that height of the bottome there proceeded both ledges and sydes out of the same.
{7:36} For in the boordes of the ledges and on the sydes, he had grauen pictures of Cherubims, lions, & paulme trees, one by another rounde about.
{7:37} Thus made he the ten feete after this maner: and they had all one fashion of casting, one measure, and one syse.
{7:38} Then made he ten lauers of brasse one lauer contayning fourtie battes: and euery lauer was foure cubites, & vpon euery one of the ten feete, he put one lauer.
{7:39} And he put fiue of those feete on the ryght syde of the house, and other fiue on the left: and he set the lauatorie on the right syde of the house eastward, and toward the south.
{7:40} And Hiram made pots, shouels, and basons, & so finished all the worke that he made king Solomon for the house of the Lorde:
{7:41} That is to say, two pillers, and two round head peeces that were to be set on the toppes of the two pillers.
{7:42} And foure hundred pomegranates for the two networkes, euen two rowes of pomegranates in one networke to couer the two head peeces that were to be set on the toppes of the pillers:
{7:43} And the ten feete, and ten lauers on the feete:
{7:44} The lauatorie, and twelue oxen vnder it:
{7:45} And pottes, shouels, and basons: And all these vessels which Hiram made to king Solomo for the house of the Lord, were of bright brasse.
{7:46} In the playne of Iordane did the king cast them euen in the thicke claye, betweene Socoh and Zarthan.
{7:47} And Solomon left all the vessels vn. wayed because they were so exceeding many, neither founde they out the waight of the brasse.
{7:48} And so Solomon made al the vessels that parteyned vnto the house of the Lorde, the golden aulter, and the golden table wheron the shew bread was:
{7:49} And fiue candelstickes for the ryght side, and fiue for the left before the quier, of pure golde, with flowres, lampes, and snuffers of golde.
{7:50} And bowles, flat peeces, basons, spoones, & masours, of pure golde: and hyndges made he of golde, both for the doores of the quier the place most holy, and for the doores of the temple also.
{7:51} And so was ended all the worke that king Solomon made for the house of the Lorde: And Solomon brought in the thinges which Dauid his father had dedicated, euen the siluer, golde, and vessels, and layde them vp among the treasures of the house of the Lord.
{8:1} Then Solomon gathered the elders of Israel, & al the heads of the tribes, and them that were captaynes amog the fathers of the children of Israel, vnto him in Hierusalem, that they might bring vp the arke of the appoyntment of the Lorde out of the citie of Dauid, which is Sion.
{8:2} And all the men of Israel assembled vnto king Solomon to the feast that falleth in the moneth Ethanim, which is the seuenth moneth.
{8:3} And al the elders of Israel were come, and the priestes tooke vp the arke.
{8:4} And they bare the arke of the Lorde, the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle: those dyd the priestes and the leuites beare.
{8:5} And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled vnto him and went with him before the arke, did offer sheepe and oxen, that could not be tolde nor numbred for multitude.
{8:6} And so the priestes brought the arke of the appoyntment of the Lord vnto his place euen into the quier of the temple and place most holy, vnder the winges of the Cherubs:
{8:7} For the Cherubs stretched out their winges ouer the place of the arke, and couered both it and also the staues therof a hie vpon it.
{8:8} And they drew out the staues, that the endes of them might appeare out of the holy place within the quier, but they were not seene without, and there they haue ben vnto this day.
{8:9} And there was nothing in the arke saue the two tables of stone, which Moyses put there at Horeb, in ye which tables the Lorde made an appoyntment with the children of Israel when he brought them out of the lande of Egypt.
{8:10} And it fortuned that when the priestes were come out of the holy place, the cloude filled the house of the Lorde,
{8:11} That the priestes could not stand and minister because of the cloude: for the glory of the Lorde had filled the house of the Lorde.
{8:12} Then spake Solomon: The Lorde saide that he would dwell in the darke cloude.
{8:13} I haue built thee an house to dwell in, an habitation for thee to abyde in for euer.
{8:14} And the king turned his face, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stoode still.
{8:15} And he saide: Blessed be the Lorde God of Israel, which spake with his mouth vnto Dauid my father, & hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying:
{8:16} Sence the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no citie of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein: But I haue chosen Dauid to be ruler ouer my people of Israel.
{8:17} And it was in the heart of Dauid my father to build an house for the name of the Lorde God of Israel:
{8:18} And the Lorde saide vnto Dauid my father: Whereas it was in thyne heart to build an house vnto my name, thou diddest well that thou wast so minded:
{8:19} Neuerthelesse, thou shalt not build the house: but thy sonne that shall come out of thy loynes, he shall build the house vnto my name.
{8:20} And the Lorde hath made good his word that he spake, and I am rysen vp in the roome of Dauid my father, and sit on the seate of Israel, as the Lorde promysed, and haue built an house for the name of the Lorde God of Israel:
{8:21} And I haue prepared therein a place for the arke, wherein is the couenaunt of the Lorde which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the lande of Egypt.
{8:22} Solomon stoode before the aulter of the Lorde in the sight of all the congregation of Israel, and stretched out his handes toward heauen, and sayde:
{8:23} Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath, thou that kepest couenaunt & mercy for thy seruauntes that walke before thee with all their heart.
{8:24} Thou that hast kept with thy seruaut Dauid my father that thou promisedst him: Thou spakest also with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thyne hand, as it is come to passe this day.
{8:25} Therfore now Lorde God of Israel, keepe with thy seruaunt Dauid my father that thou promisedst him, saying, Thou shalt not be without a man in my sight to syt on the seate of Israel: so that thy childre take heede to their way, that they walke before me, as thou hast walked in my sight.
{8:26} And now O God of Israel, let thy word be verified which thou spakest vnto thy seruaunt Dauid my father.
{8:27} Wyll God in deede dwell on the earth? Beholde, the heauens and heauens of all heauens are not able to contayne thee: and how should then this house do it that I haue builded?
{8:28} Haue thou therefore respect vnto the prayer of thy seruaunt, and to his supplication O Lorde my God, to heare the crye and prayer which thy seruaunt prayeth before thee this day:
{8:29} That thyne eyes may be open toward this house nyght and day, euen toward this place, of which thou haste said, My name shal be there: That thou mayst hearken vnto the prayer which thy seruaunt prayeth in this place,
{8:30} And regarde thou the supplication of thy seruaunt and of thy people Israel when they pray in this place: and heare thou in heauen thy dwelling place, and when thou hearest haue mercy.
{8:31} If any man trespasse against his neyghbour, & there go an oth betweene them, and the one compel the other, and come, swearing before thyne aulter in this house:
{8:32} Then hearken thou in heauen, and do and iudge thy seruauntes, that thou condemne the vngodly, to bring his way vpon his head: and iustifie the righteous, to geue him according to his righteousnesse.
{8:33} When thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemie, because they haue sinned against thee, & afterwarde turne againe to thee, and knowledge vnto thy name, and pray and make supplication vnto thee in this house:
{8:34} Then heare thou in heauen, to be mercifull vnto the sinne of thy people Israel, and bring them againe vnto the land which thou gauest vnto their fathers.
{8:35} If heauen be shut vp, and there be no rayne, because they haue sinned against thee: yet if they pray in this place, and knowledge vnto thy name, and turne from their sinne through thy scourging of them:
{8:36} Then heare thou in heauen, and be mercyfull vnto the sinnes of thy seruauntes, and of thy people Israel, that thou shewe them a good way to walke in, and geue rayne vpon the lande that thou hast geuen to thy people to inherite.
{8:37} If there be in the lande dearth, or pestilence, drouth, blasting, grashopper, or caterpiller: or if their enemie besiege the in the lande of their cities, or whatsoeuer plague or sickenesse chaunce,
{8:38} Then what prayers and supplication soeuer be made of any man, of all thy people Israel, which shall knowledge euery man the plague of his owne heart, and stretch foorth his handes toward this house:
{8:39} Heare thou then in heauen, euen in thy dwelling place, and be mercyfull, and do and geue euery man according to his wayes, euen as thou that onely knowest his heart (for thou onely knowest the heartes of all the children of men:)
{8:40} That they may feare thee as long as they lyue in the lande which thou gauest vnto our fathers.
{8:41} And likewyse if a straunger that is not of thy people Israel, come out of a farre countrey for thy names sake:
{8:42} (For they shal heare of thy great name, and of thy mightie hand, & of thy stretched out arme) and shall come and pray in this house:
{8:43} Therfore heare thou in heauen thy dwelling place, & do all that the straunger calleth to thee for: that all nations of the earth may knowe thy name, and feare thee as do thy people Israel, and that they may knowe that thy name is called vpon in this house which I haue builded.
{8:44} If thy people go out to battell against their enemie whythersoeuer thou shalt send them, and shal pray vnto the Lord toward the way of the citie which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I haue built for thy name:
{8:45} Heare thou in heauen their prayer and supplication, and iudge their cause.
{8:46} If they sinne against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not) & thou be angry with them, and delyuer them into the hand of their enemies, so that they cary them away prisoners, vnto the lande of their enemies whether farre or neare:
{8:47} Yet if they turne againe vnto their heartes in the lande of them that caryed them away captiues, & returne and pray vnto thee in the lande of their enemies, saying, we haue sinned, we haue done wickely, and haue committed vngodlynesse:
{8:48} And so turne agayne vnto thee with all their heart and all their soule in the lande of their enemies which led them away captiue, and pray vnto thee, toward the way of their land which thou gauest vnto their fathers, and toward the citie which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I haue built for thy name:
{8:49} Then heare thou their prayer and supplication in heauen thy dwellyng place, and iudge their cause:
{8:50} And be mercyfull vnto thy people that haue sinned against thee, and vnto all their iniquities wherby they haue done wickedly against thee, & get thou them the fauour of those whiche led them away captiue, that they may haue compassion on them.
{8:51} For they be thy people, and thyne inheritaunce, whiche thou broughtest out of Egypt, euen from the middest of the fornace of iron.
{8:52} And let thyne eyes be open vnto the prayer of thy seruaunt, and vnto the prayer of thy people Israel, to hearken vnto them in all that they call for vnto thee.
{8:53} For thou dyddest seperate them from among all the nations of the earth to be thyne owne inheritaunce, as thou saydest by the hande of Moyses thy seruaunt, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt O Lorde God.
{8:54} And when Solomon had made an ende of praying all this prayer and supplication vnto the Lorde, he arose from before the aulter of the Lorde, & from kneling on his knees, & from stretching of his handes vp to heauen,
{8:55} And stoode & blessed all the congregatio of Israel, with a loude voyce, saying:
{8:56} Blessed be the Lorde that hath geuen rest vnto his people Israel, according to al that he promised: there hath not fayled one worde of all the good promise which he promised by the hand of Moyses his seruaunt.
{8:57} The Lorde our God be with vs, as he was with our fathers, and forsake vs not, neither leaue vs:
{8:58} But that he may bowe our heartes vnto him, that we may walke in all his wayes, & kepe his commaundementes, his statutes, and his lawes whiche he commaunded our fathers.
{8:59} And these my wordes whiche I haue prayed before the Lorde, be nye vnto the Lorde our God day and night, that he defende the cause of his seruaunt, and the cause of his people Israel, what thing soeuer chaunce at any time:
{8:60} That al nations of ye earth may knowe that the Lord is God, and none but he.
{8:61} Let your heart therfore be perfect with the Lord our God, that ye walke in his statutes, and kepe his commaundementes, as this day.
{8:62} And the king and al Israel with him offered offeringes before the Lorde.
{8:63} And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offringes whiche he offered vnto the Lorde to wit twentie and two thousande oxen, and an hundred and twentie thousande sheepe: And so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lorde.
{8:64} The same day dyd the king halowe the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord: for there he offered burnt offeringes, meate offeringes, and the fat of the peace offeringes: because the brasen aulter that was before the Lorde, was to litle to receaue the burnt offringes, meate offeringes, and the fat of the peace offeringes.
{8:65} And Solomon helde that same time an hye feast, and all Israel with him, a verie great congregation, euen from the entring in of Hemath vnto the riuer of Egypt before the Lorde our God seuen dayes, and seuen dayes, euen foureteene dayes.
{8:66} And the eyght day he sent the people away, & they blessed the king, and went vnto their tentes, ioyous and with glad heart, because of all the goodnesse that the Lorde had done for Dauid his seruaunt, and for Israel his people.
{9:1} And when Solomon had finished the buylding of the house of the Lorde, and the kinges palace, and all that he had in his minde & was appoynted to make:
{9:2} The Lorde appeared to Solomon the second time, as he appeared vnto him at Gibeon.
{9:3} And ye Lord said vnto him, I haue heard thy prayer & thy intercession that thou hast made before me: For I haue halowed this house, which thou hast built to put my name there for euer, & mine eies & myne hearte shalbe there perpetually.
{9:4} And if thou wilt walke before me, as Dauid thy father walked, in purenes of heart and in righteousnes, to do all that I haue commaunded thee, and wilt kepe my statutes, and my lawes:
{9:5} Then will I stablishe the seate of thy kingdome vpon Israel for euer, as I promised to Dauid thy father, saying: Thou shalt not be without a ma vpon the seate of Israel.
{9:6} But and if ye and your children turne away from me, and will not kepe my commaundementes and my statutes whiche I haue set before you, but go and serue other gods, & worship them:
{9:7} Then will I weede Israel out of the lande which I haue geuen them, and this house which I haue halowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and Israel shalbe a prouerbe and a fable among all nations,
{9:8} And this house shalbe taken away: so that euery one that passeth by it, shalbe astonied, and shall hysse, and they shall say: Why hath the Lord done thus vnto this lande, and to this house?
{9:9} And they shal aunswere: Because they forsoke the Lorde their God, whiche brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and haue taken hold vpon other gods, and haue worshipped them, and serued them: therfore hath the Lorde brought vpon them all this euyll.
{9:10} And it fortuned, that at the ende of twentie yeres when Solomon had finished the buylding of the two houses, that is to wyte, the house of the Lorde and the kinges palace,
{9:11} (And Hiram the king of Tyre brought Solomon timbre of Cedar, & firre trees, golde, and whatsoeuer he desired) Then Solomon gaue Hiram twentie cities in the lande of Galilee.
{9:12} And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities whiche Solomon had geuen hym, and they pleased him not.
{9:13} And he sayde: What cities are these which thou hast geuen me my brother? And he called them the lande of barren vnto this day.
{9:14} And Hiram sent the king sixe score talentes of gold.
{9:15} (And this is the summe whiche king Solomon raysed for a tribute when he buylded the house of the Lorde, and his owne house, and Millo, and the wall of Hierusalem, and Hazor, and Megeddo, and Gazer.
{9:16} For Pharao king of Egypt went vp, and toke Gazer and burnt it with fire, and slue the Chanaanites that dwelt in the citie, and gaue it for a present vnto his daughter, Solomons wyfe.
{9:17} And Solomon buylt Gazer & Bethhoron the neather,
{9:18} And Baalath and Thamar in the wildernesse in the lande:
{9:19} And all the treasure cities that Solomon had, and cities for his charettes, and cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired, and woulde buyld in Hierusalem, in Libanon, and in all the lande of his dominion)
{9:20} And al the people that were left of the Amorites, Hethites, Pherezites, Heuites and Iebusites, whiche were not of the children of Israel,
{9:21} Their children that were left after them in the lande, whom the children of Israel also were not able to destroy: those dyd Solomon compell to bring tribute, vnto this day.
{9:22} But of the children of Israel dyd Solomon make no bondmen: But they were men of warre, his ministers, his lordes, his captaynes, and rulers of his charettes, and his horsemen.
{9:23} And these were the lordes that were set ouer Solomons worke euen fiue hundred were they and fiftie, and they ruled the people that wrought ye worke.
{9:24} And Pharaos daughter came vp out of the citie of Dauid, vnto her house which Solomon had buylt for her: and then dyd he also buylde Millo.
{9:25} And thryse a yere did Solomon offer burnt offringes & peace offringes vpon the aulter whiche he buylt vnto the Lorde, and he burnt incense vpon the aulter that was before the Lord, and so he finished the house.
{9:26} And king Solomon made a nauie of shippes in Azion Gaber, which is beside Eloth, on the brinke of the red sea, in the lande of Edom.
{9:27} And Hiram sent by shippe also of his seruauntes, that were shipmen and had knowledge of the sea, with the seruauntes of Solomon:
{9:28} And they came to Ophir, and set from thence foure hundred and twentie talentes of golde, and brought it to king Solomon.
{10:1} And the queene of Saba hearing the fame of Solomon (concerning the name of the Lord) came to proue him with harde questions.
{10:2} And she came to Hierusalem with a verie great trayne, with camels that bare sweete odours, and gold exceeding much, & precious stones: And she came to Solomon, and communed with him of al that was in her heart.
{10:3} And Solomon declared vnto her all her questions, so that there was not one thing hyd from the king whiche he expounded not vnto her.
{10:4} And the queene of Saba considered al Solomons wysdome, & the house that he had buylded,
{10:5} And the meate of his table, and the sitting of his seruauntes, the order of his ministers & their apparell, & his drinke, and his burnt sacrifices that he offred in the house of the Lorde: and she was astonied.
{10:6} And she sayde vnto the king: It was a true word that I hearde in myne owne land of thy sayinges, & of thy wisdome.
{10:7} Howbeit I beleued it not, till I came & sawe it with myne eyes: And beholde, the one halfe was not tolde me: for thy wysdome and prosperitie exceedeth the fame which I hearde of thee.
{10:8} Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy seruauntes whiche stand euer before thee, and heare thy wysdome.
{10:9} Blessed be the Lorde thy God, whiche loued thee, to set thee on the seate of Israel, because the Lorde loued Israel for euer, & made thee king to do equite and righteousnes.
{10:10} And she gaue the king sixe score talentes of golde, and of sweete odours exceeding much, and precious stones: There came no more suche aboundaunce of sweete odours, as the queene of Saba gaue to king Solomon.
{10:11} The nauie also of the shippes of Hiram (that caried golde from Ophir) brought lykewyse great plentie of Almuge trees, and precious stones from Ophir.
{10:12} And the king made of the Almuge trees pillers for the house of the Lorde and for the kinges palace, and made harpes and psalteries for singers: Ther came no more suche Almuge trees, nor were any more seene vnto this day.
{10:13} And king Solomon gaue vnto the queene of Saba according to all her desire whatsoeuer she asked, besides that he gaue her of a free wil with his owne hande: And so she returned vnto her owne countrey, both she and her seruauntes.
{10:14} The waight of golde that came to Solomon in one yere, was sixe hundred theescore and sixe talentes of golde,
{10:15} Besydes that he had of marchauntes, and of the marchaundises of the spices, and of all the kinges of Arabia, & of the lordes of the countrey.
{10:16} And king Solomon made two hundred targettes of beaten golde: sixe hundred sicles of golde went to a target.
{10:17} And he made three hundred shieldes of beaten golde: three pounde of gold went to one shielde, and the king put them in the house of the wood of Libanon.
{10:18} And the king made a great seate of iuorie, and couered it with the best golde.
{10:19} And the seate had sixe steppes, and the toppe of the seate was rounde behinde, & there were pommelles on either syde on the place of the seate, and two lions stoode besyde the pommelles.
{10:20} And there stoode twelue lions on the steppes, sixe on a syde: There was none lyke worke seene in any kingdome.
{10:21} And al king Solomons drinking vessels were of golde, and lykewyse all the vessels of the house of the wood of Libanon were of pure golde: And as for siluer, it was nothing worth in the dayes of Solomon:
{10:22} For the kinges nauie of shippes went on the sea vnto Tharsis with the nauie of Hirams shippes: euen once in three yeres went the nauie to Tharsis, and brought golde and siluer, Elephantes teeth, apes, and pecockes.
{10:23} And so king Solomon exceeded al the kinges of the earth both in ryches and wysdome.
{10:24} And all the worlde resorted to Solomon, to heare his wysdome which God had put in his heart:
{10:25} And brought him euery man his present, vessels of siluer, & vessels of golde, rayment, harnesse, and sweete odours, and horses, and mules, yere by yere.
{10:26} And Solomon gathered together charettes and horsemen: and he had a thousande and foure hundred charettes, and twelue thousande horsemen, whom he bestowed in the charet cities, and with the king at Hierusalem.
{10:27} And the king made siluer in Hierusalem as plenteous as stones, and Cedar as plenteous as the wilde fegge trees that growe aboundauntly in the fieldes.
{10:28} Also Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and fine linnen: the kinges marchauntes receaued the linnen for a price.
{10:29} A charet came vp out of Egypt for sixe hundred sicles of siluer, that is, one horse for an hundred and fiftie: And euen so for al the kinges of the Hethites, and for the kinges of Siria, did they bring them out through their handes.
{11:1} But king Solomo loued many outlandishe women, & the daughter of Pharao, and women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonites, & Hethites:
{11:2} Wher as yet concerning these nations, the Lorde sayd vnto the children of Israel: Go not ye into them, nor let them come into, els will they turne your heartes after their gods: Neuerthelesse, Solomon claue vnto them in loue.
{11:3} And he had seuen hundred queenes, and three hundred concubines: and his wyues turned away his heart.
{11:4} For it came to passe when Solomon was olde, his wyues turned his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of Dauid his father.
{11:5} For Solomon folowed Astaroth the god of the Zidons, and Milcom the abhomination of the Ammonites.
{11:6} And Solomon wrought wickednesse in the sight of the Lorde, and folowed not the Lorde perfectly, as dyd Dauid his father.
{11:7} For then dyd Solomon buylde an hye place for Chamos the abhomination of Moabim the hill that is before Hierusalem, & vnto Moloch the abhomination of the children of Ammon.
{11:8} And lykewyse dyd he for all his outlandishe wyues, which burnt cense and offered vnto their gods.
{11:9} And the Lorde was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned fro the Lord God of Israel which had appeared vnto him twyse,
{11:10} And gaue him a charge concerning this thyng, that he shoulde not folowe other gods: But he kept not that which the Lorde commaunded him.
{11:11} Wherfore the Lorde sayde vnto Solomon: Forasmuche as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept myne appoyntment, and my statutes whiche I commaunded thee, I wil rent the kingdome from thee, and will geue it to thy seruaunt.
{11:12} Notwithstanding, in thy dayes I will not do it, because of Dauid thy father: but wil take it fro the hand of thy sonne.
{11:13} Howbeit, I will not take away all the kingdome: But will geue one tribe to thy sonne, because of Dauid my seruaut, and because of Hierusalem whiche I haue chosen.
{11:14} And the Lorde stirred vp an aduersarie vnto Solomon, euen one Hadad an Edomite, of the kinges seede, whiche was in Edom.
{11:15} For when Dauid was in Edom, and Ioab the captayne of the hoast was gone vp to burie them that were slaine, he smote all the men children in Edom:
{11:16} (For sixe monethes dyd Ioab remayne there, and all Israel, till he had destroyed all the men children of Edom.)
{11:17} And this Hadad fled, and certaine other Edomites of his fathers seruautes with hym, to come into Egypt, Hadad beyng yet a litle childe.
{11:18} And they arose out of Madian, & came to Paran, and toke men with them out of Paran, and came to Egypt vnto Pharao king of Egypt, whiche gaue him an house, and appoynted him vittailes, and gaue him lande.
{11:19} And Hadad gat great fauour in the sight of Pharao, so that he gaue him to wyfe the sister of his owne wyfe, euen the syster of Thahpenes the queene.
{11:20} And the sister of Thahpenes bare him Genubath his sonne, who Thahpenes norished in Pharaos house: And Genubath was with Pharaos housholde among the sonnes of Pharao.
{11:21} And when Hadad hearde in Egypt that Dauid was layde to sleepe with his fathers, & that Ioab the captayne of the hoaste was dead also, he sayde to Pharao: Let me depart, that I may go to myne owne countrey.
{11:22} Pharao sayde vnto him: What hast thou lacked here with me, that thou wouldest thus go to thyne owne countrey? He aunswered, Nothing: howbeit, let me go.
{11:23} And God stirred him vp another aduersarie, one Rezon the sonne of Eliada, whiche fled from his lorde Hadadezer king of Zoba:
{11:24} And he gathered men vnto him, and became captayne ouer the companie when Dauid slue them: And they went to Damasco, and dwelt there, and raigned in Damasco.
{11:25} Therfore was he an aduersarie to Israel all the dayes of Solomon, and this was the mischiefe, in that Hadad dyd abhorre Israel and raigned ouer Syria.
{11:26} And Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat, an Ephrathite of Zareda (whose mother was called Zeruah, whiche was a wydowe) and he Solomons seruaunt, lyft vp his hande against the king.
{11:27} But this was the cause that he lift vp his hande against the king: Solomon buylt Mello, and mended the broken places of the citie of Dauid his father.
{11:28} And this felowe Ieroboam was a man of strength & courage: And Solomon sawe the young man that he was able to do the worke, he made him ruler ouer all the charge of the house of Ioseph.
{11:29} And it chaunced at that season that Ieroboam went out of Ierusalem, and the prophete Ahia the Silonite met him by the way, hauing a newe mantel on him, and they two were alone in the fielde.
{11:30} Ahia caught the newe mantel that was on him, & rent it in twelue peeces,
{11:31} And sayd to Ieroboam, Take thee ten peeces: For thus sayth the Lorde God of Israel, Behold, I will rent the kingdome out of the handes of Solomon, and will geue ten tribes to thee.
{11:32} And he shal haue one for my seruaunt Dauids sake, and for Hierusalem, the citie which I haue chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:
{11:33} Because they haue forsaken me, & haue worshipped Astharoth the god of the Zidons, and Chamos the god of the Moabites, & Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, & haue not walked in my wayes, to fulfill my pleasure, my statutes, and my lawes, as dyd Dauid his father.
{11:34} I will not take the whole kingdome out of his hand: But I will make him chiefe all his lyfe long for Dauid my seruauntes sake whom I chose: because he kept my commaundementes and my statutes:
{11:35} But I will take the kingdome out of his sonnes hande, and will geue it vnto thee, euen ten tribes of it:
{11:36} And vnto his sonne will I geue one tribe, that Dauid my seruaut may haue a light alway before me in Hierusalem, the citie which I haue chosen me to put my name there.
{11:37} And I will take thee, and thou shalt raigne according to all that thy soule desireth, and shalt be king ouer Israel.
{11:38} And if thou hearken vnto all that I commaunde thee, and wilt walke in my wayes, and do that is right in my sight, that thou kepe my statutes and my commaundementes as Dauid my seruaunt dyd, then will I be with thee, and buyld thee a sure house, as I buylt for my seruaunt Dauid, and will geue Israel vnto thee:
{11:39} And I will for this offence whiche Solomon hath committed vexe the seede of Dauid, but nor for euer.
{11:40} Solomon sought therfore to kil Ieroboam, and Ieroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, vnto Sisac king of Egypt, and continued there in Egypt vntill the death of Solomon.
{11:41} The rest of the wordes that concerne Solomon, and all that he dyd, and his wysdome, are they not written in the booke of the wordes of Solomon?
{11:42} The tyme that Solomon raigned in Hierusalem vpon al Israel was fourtie yeres.
{11:43} And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the citie of Dauid his father: and Rehoboam his sonne raigned in his steade.
{12:1} And Rehoboam went to Siche: for all Israel were come to Sichem, to make him king.
{12:2} And when Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat whiche was yet in Egypt, heard of it: for he fled to Egypt from the presence of king Solomon, and dwelt in Egypt.
{12:3} So they sent, and called him: and Ieroboam and all the congregation of Is-Israel came, & spake vnto Rehoboam, saying:
{12:4} Thy father made our yocke greeuous, nowe therfore make thou the greenous seruice of thy father and his sore yocke whiche he put vpon vs, lighter, and we will serue thee.
{12:5} And he sayde vnto them: Depart yet for the space of three dayes, and then come againe to me. And the people departed.
{12:6} And king Rehoboam toke counsel with the olde men that stoode before Solomon his father, while he yet lyued, and sayd: What counsel geue ye, that I may haue matter to aunswere this people?
{12:7} And they sayd vnto him: If thou be a seruaunt vnto this people this day, and folowe their mindes, and aunswere them, & speake kinde wordes to them, they will be thy seruauntes for euer.
{12:8} But he forsoke the counsell that the old men had geuen him, and called vnto his counsel young men, that were growe vp with him and wayted on him,
{12:9} And he sayde vnto them: What counsell geue ye, that we may aunswere this people? for they haue communed with me, saying: Make the yocke whiche thy father did put vpon vs, lighter.
{12:10} And ye young men that were growen vp with him, spake vnto him, saying: Thus shalt thou speake vnto this people that haue sayd vnto thee, thy father made our yocke heauy, but make thou it vs lighter: Euen thus shalt thou say vnto them, My litle finger shalbe wayghtier then my father was in the loynes.
{12:11} And nowe where as my father did lade you & put a greeuous yocke vpon you, I will make it heauier: My father hath chastised you with roddes, but I will correct you with scourges.
{12:12} And so Ieroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the thirde day, as the king had appoynted, saying, Come to me againe the thirde day.
{12:13} And the king aunswered the people churlishly, and left the old mens counsel that they gaue him:
{12:14} And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying: My father made your yocke greeuous, and I will make it greeuouser: My father also chastised you with roddes, but I will chastise you with scourges.
{12:15} And the king hearkened not vnto the people: for it was the ordinaunce of God, that he might perfourme his saying, whiche the Lord spake by Ahia the Silonite vnto Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat.
{12:16} And so when all Israel sawe that the king regarded them not, the people aunswered the king with these wordes, saying: What portion haue we in Dauid? we haue no inheritaunce in the sonne of Isai: To your tentes O Israel, nowe see to thyne owne house Dauid. And so Israel departed vnto their tentes.
{12:17} Howebeit, ouer the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Iuda, dyd Rehoboam raigne still.
{12:18} The king Rehoboam sent Aduram the receauer of the tribute, and all they of Israel stoned him to death: But king Rehoboam made speede to get him vp to his charet, and to flee to Hierusalem.
{12:19} And they of Israel rebelled against the house of Dauid, vnto this day.
{12:20} And when al Israel heard that Ieroboam was come againe, they sent, and called him vnto the multitude, and made him king ouer al Israel: and there was no tribe that folowed the house of Dauid, but Iuda onely.
{12:21} And when Rehoboam was come to Hierusalem, he gathered all the house of Iuda, with the tribe of Beniamin, an hundred and fourescore thousande of chosen men which were good warriours, to fight against the house of Israel, and to bring the kingdome againe to Rehoboam the sonne of Solomon.
{12:22} And the worde of God came vnto Semaia the man of God, saying:
{12:23} Speake vnto Rehoboam the sonne of Solomon king of Iuda, & vnto all the house of Iuda and Beniamin, & to the remnaunt of the people, saying:
{12:24} Thus sayeth the Lorde, Ye shall not go vp, nor yet fight against your brethren the children of Israel: returne euery man to his house, for this thing is my doyng. They hearkened therfore to the worde of the Lorde, and returned to depart, according to the word of the Lord.
{12:25} Then Ieroboam buylt Sichem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therin: and went from thence, and buylt Penuel.
{12:26} And Ieroboam thought in his heart: nowe shall the kingdome returne to the house of Dauid.
{12:27} For if this people go vp and do sacrifice in the house of the Lorde at Hierusalem, then shall the heart of this people turne againe vnto their lorde Rehoboam king of Iuda, and so shal they kill me, and go againe to Rehoboam king of Iuda.
{12:28} Wherupon the king toke counsel, and made two calues of golde, and sayd vnto them, It is muche for you to go vp to Hierusalem: Behold O Israel, these are thy goddes, which brought thee out of the lande of Egypt.
{12:29} And he set the one in Bethel, and the other set he in Dan.
{12:30} And this thing turned to sinne: for the people went (because of the one) as farre as Dan.
{12:31} And he made an house of hill aulters, and made priestes of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sonnes of Leui.
{12:32} And Ieroboam made a feast the fyfteene day of the eyght moneth, lyke vnto the feast that is in Iuda, and offered on the aulter: And so did he in Bethel, to offer vnto the calues that he had made: And he put in Bethel the priestes of the hill aulters which he had made.
{12:33} And he went vp to the aulter to burne incense whiche he had made in Bethel the fyfteene day of the eyght moneth, euen in the moneth whiche he had imagined of his owne hearte: and made a solemne feast vnto the children of Israel, and offered vpon the aulter, and burnt incense.
{13:1} And behold, ther came a man of God out of Iuda by the worde of the lord, vnto Bethel: and Ieroboam stoode by the aulter to put incense.
{13:2} And he cried against the aulter in the worde of the Lorde, and sayd: O aulter aulter, thus sayeth the Lorde: Behold, a childe shall be borne vnto the house of Dauid, Iosia by name, and vpon thee shall he offer the priestes of the hill aulters that burnt incense vpon thee, and mens bones shalbe burnt vpon thee.
{13:3} And he gaue a token the same time, saying: This is the token that the Lorde hath spoken it: Beholde, the aulter shall rent, and the ashes that are vpon it shall fall out.
{13:4} And when the king hearde the saying of the man of God whiche had cryed against the aulter in Bethel, he stretched out his hande from the aulter, saying, Holde him: And his hand which he put foorth against him dried vp, & he coulde not pull it in againe to him.
{13:5} The aulter also claue asunder, and the ashes fell out from the aulter, according to the token which the man of God had geuen by the worde of the Lorde.
{13:6} And the king aunswered, and sayd vnto the man of God: Oh pray vnto the Lorde thy God, and make intercession for me, that my hande may be restored me againe. And the ma of God besought the Lord, and the kinges hand was restored againe, and became as it was afore.
{13:7} And the king sayde vnto the man of God: Come home with me, that thou mayest dine, and I will geue thee a reward.
{13:8} And the man of God sayde vnto the king: If thou wouldest geue me halfe thyne house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eate bread, nor drinke water in this place:
{13:9} For so was it charged me through the word of the Lord, saying: Eate no bread nor drinke water, nor turne agayne by the same way that thou camest.
{13:10} And so he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.
{13:11} And there dwelt an olde prophet in Bethel, and his sonnes came and tolde him al the workes that the man of God had done that day in Bethel, and the wordes which he had spoken vnto the king tolde they their father also.
{13:12} And their father sayde vnto them: What way went he? And his sonnes shewed him what way the man of God went which came from Iuda.
{13:13} And he saide vnto his sonnes: Saddle me the asse. Which when they had saddled, he gat him vp thereon,
{13:14} And went after the man of God, and founde him sytting vnder a tree, and he said vnto him: Art thou the man of God that camest from Iuda? And he sayde, I am.
{13:15} He sayde vnto him: Come home with me, and eate bread.
{13:16} He aunswered: I may not returne with thee, to go in with thee: neither wyl I eate bread, or drinke water with thee in this place.
{13:17} For it was saide to me in the word of the Lord: Thou shalt eate no bread, nor drinke water there, nor turne againe to go by the way that thou camest.
{13:18} He saide vnto him: I am a prophet also as well as thou, and an angell spake vnto me in the word of the Lorde, saying: Bryng him againe with thee into thyne house, that he may eate bread, & drinke water. And he lyed vnto him.
{13:19} And so he went againe with him, and did eate bread in his house, and drancke water.
{13:20} And it fortuned, that as they sat at the table, the word of the Lorde came vnto the prophet that brought him againe:
{13:21} And he cryed vnto the man of God that came from Iuda, saying, Thus saith the Lord: Because thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lorde, and hast not kept the commaundement which the Lorde thy God commaunded thee:
{13:22} But camest backe againe, and hast eaten bread, & druncke water in the place concerning the which the Lorde did say vnto thee, Thou shalt eate no bread, nor dryncke no water: thy carkasse shall not come vnto the sepulchre of thy fathers.
{13:23} And so it came to passe that when he had eaten bread, and druncke, he sadled him the asse, to wit, to the prophet who he had brought againe.
{13:24} And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slue him: and his carkasse was cast in the way, & the asse stoode thereby, and the lion stoode by the corse also.
{13:25} And men that passed by sawe the carcasse cast in the way, & the lion standing by the carcasse: and they came and tolde it in the towne where the olde prophet dwelt.
{13:26} And when the prophet that brought him backe againe from the way heard thereof, he sayd: It is the man of God, he was disobedient vnto the word of the Lorde, and therefore the Lord hath deliuered him vnto the lion, which hath rent him, & slaine him according to the word of the Lorde which he spake vnto him.
{13:27} And he spake to his sonnes, saying: Sadle me an asse: And they sadled him.
{13:28} And he went, and founde his body cast in the way, and the asse and the lion stoode by the corse, and the lion had not eaten the carcasse, nor hurt the asse.
{13:29} And the prophet toke vp the body of the man of God, and layde it vpon the asse, and brought it againe: and the olde prophet came to the citie to lament, and to burie him.
{13:30} And he layde his body in his owne graue, and then lamented ouer him saying Alas my brother.
{13:31} And when he had buryed him, he spake to his sonnes, saying: When I am dead, see that ye burie me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried: laye my bones beside his bones.
{13:32} For the saying which he cryed at the word of the Lorde against the aulter in Bethel, and against all the houses of hie places which are in the cities of Samarie, shall come to passe.
{13:33} Howbeit, for all that Ieroboam conuerted not from his wicked way: but turned backe, and made of the lowest of the people priestes of the hie places: And who so pleased him, he filled his hand, and he became priest of the hie places.
{13:34} And this thing turned to sinne vnto the house of Ieroboam, euen to destroy him, and to bring him to naught from of the face of the earth.
{14:1} At that time Abia the sonne of Ieroboam fel sicke.
{14:2} And Ieroboam saide vnto his wyfe: Up I pray thee, and disguise thy selfe, that thou be not knowen to be the wyfe of Ieroboam: and get thee to Silo, for there is Ahia the prophet which tolde me that I should be king ouer this people.
{14:3} And take with thee ten loaues, and cracknelles, and a cruse of hony, and go to him, that he may tell thee what shall become of the childe.
{14:4} And Ieroboams wyfe did so, and arose, and went to Silo, and came to the house of Ahia: But Ahia could not see, for his eyes were waxen dimme for age.
{14:5} And the Lorde saide vnto Ahia: Beholde, the wyfe of Ieroboam commeth to aske a thing of thee for her sonne, for he is sicke: But thus & thus shalt thou saye vnto her. And whe she came in, she fayned her selfe to be an other woman.
{14:6} But when Ahia heard the sounde of her feete as she came in at the doore, he sayd: Come in thou wyfe of Ieroboam, why faynest thou thy selfe so to be another? I am sent to thee to shew thee heauy thynges.
{14:7} Go, tell Ieroboam, thus sayth the Lorde God of Israel: It repenteth me forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince ouer my people Israel,
{14:8} I did rent the kingdome away from the house of Dauid, & gaue it thee: Neuerthelesse, thou hast not ben as my seruaunt Dauid, which kept my commaundementes, and folowed me with all his heart, to do that onely which was right in myne eyes:
{14:9} But hast done euil aboue al that were before thee: For thou hast gone & made thee other gods, and moulten images, to prouoke me, and hast cast me behinde thy backe:
{14:10} Therefore beholde, I wyll bring euill vpon the house of Ieroboam, and wyll roote out from Ieroboam euen him that pysseth against the wall, and him that is in pryson and forsaken in Israel, and wyll take away the remnaunt of the house of Ieroboam, as a man taketh away doung tyll he hath caryed all.
{14:11} Whosoeuer of Ieroboams house die in the towne, him shall the dogges eate: and he that dyeth in the fielde, shall the foules of the ayre eate: for the Lorde hath saide it.
{14:12} Up therfore & get thee to thyne owne house: Beholde, when thy foote entreth into the citie, the childe shall dye,
{14:13} And all they of Israel shall mourne for him, and burie him: For he onely of Ieroboam shal come to the sepulchre, because in him there is found goodnesse toward the Lord God of Israel in the house of Ieroboam.
{14:14} Moreouer, the Lord shal stirre him vp a king ouer Israel which shall destroy the house of Ieroboam in that day: But what is it now?
{14:15} For the Lorde shall smyte Israel as when a reede is shaken in the water, & he shall weede Israel out of this good lande which he gaue to their fathers, & shall scatter them beyond the ryuer, because they haue made them groues, and angred the Lorde.
{14:16} And he shall geue Israel vp because of the sinnes of Ieroboam, which did sinne, and made Israel to sinne.
{14:17} And Ieroboams wyfe arose, and departed, and came to Thirzah: & when she came to the thressholde of the doore, the childe was dead.
{14:18} And al Israel buried him, and lamenting him, according to the word of the Lorde which he spake by the hande of his seruaunt Ahia the prophet.
{14:19} And the rest of the wordes that concerne Ieroboam, how he warred, and how he raigned, beholde they are written in the booke of the cronicles of the kinges of Israel.
{14:20} And the dayes which Ieroboam raigned, were two and twentie yeres: And when he was layed asleepe with his fathers, Nadab his sonne raigned in his steade.
{14:21} Rehoboam the sonne of Solomon raigned in Iuda: and Rehoboam was fourtie and one yeres olde when he began to raigne, & he raigned seuenteene yeres in Hierusalem, the citie which the Lorde did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: His mothers name was Naama, an Ammonite.
{14:22} And Iuda wrought wickednesse in the sight of the Lorde, and angred him in mo thinges then their fathers dyd in their sinnes which they sinned.
{14:23} For they also made them hie places, images, and groues on euery hie hill, and vnder euery thicke tree.
{14:24} And there was a stewes of male children in the lande, and they did according to all the abhominations of the nations which the Lord cast out before the children of Israel.
{14:25} And it fortuned, that in the fift yere of king Rehoboam, Sisac king of Egypt came vp against Hierusalem:
{14:26} And toke away the treasures of the house of the Lorde, and the treasures of the kings house, & spoyled all that was to be had: And he toke away all the shieldes of golde which Solomon had made.
{14:27} In whose steade king Rehoboam made brasen shieldes, and committed them vnto the handes of the keping of the captaynes of the garde, which wayted at the doore of the kinges house.
{14:28} And when the king went into the house of the Lorde, they of the garde bare them, & brought them againe into the garde chamber.
{14:29} The rest of the wordes that concerne Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the booke of the cronicles of the kinges of Iuda?
{14:30} And there was warre betweene Rehoboam and Ieroboam all their lyues.
{14:31} And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buryed besyde his fathers in the citie of Dauid: His mothers name was Naama, an Ammonite. And Abiam his sonne raigned in his steade.
{15:1} In the eighteenth yere of king Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat, raigned Abiam ouer Iuda.
{15:2} Three yeres raigned he in Hierusalem: and his mothers name was Maacha, the daughter of Abisalom.
{15:3} And he walked in all the sinnes of his father which he had done before him, and his heart was not perfect with the Lorde his God, as the heart of Dauid his father.
{15:4} Neuerthelesse, for Dauids sake did the Lorde his God geue him a lyght in Hierusalem, that he set vp his sonne after him, and stablished Hierusalem:
{15:5} Because Dauid did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and turned from nothing that he commaunded him all the dayes of his lyfe, saue onely in the matter of Urias the Hethite.
{15:6} And there was warre betweene Rehoboam and Ieroboam, as long as he lyued.
{15:7} The rest of the wordes that concerne Abiam, and all that he did, are they not written in the booke of the cronicles of the kinges of Iuda? And there was warre betweene Abiam & Ieroboam.
{15:8} And Abiam slept with his fathers, & they buried him in the citie of Dauid: and Asa his sonne raigned in his steade.
{15:9} In the twentith yere of Ieroboam king of Israel raigned Asa ouer Iuda.
{15:10} Fourtie & one yeres raigned he in Hierusalem: and his mothers name was Maacha, the daughter of Abisalom.
{15:11} And Asa did that seemed ryght in the eyes of the Lorde, as did Dauid his father.
{15:12} And he toke away the male stewes out of the lande, and put away all the abhominable idols that his fathers had made.
{15:13} And he put downe Maacha his mother from bearing rule, because she had made an idoll in a groue: And Asa destroyed her idoll, and burnt it by the brooke Cedron.
{15:14} But the hie places were not put downe: Neuerthelesse Asa his heart was perfect with the Lorde all his dayes.
{15:15} He brought in the holy vessels of his father, and that he had dedicate vnto the house of the Lord, golde, and siluer, and iewels.
{15:16} And there was warre betweene Asa, & Baasa king of Israel all their dayes.
{15:17} And Baasa king of Israel went vp against Iuda, and built Rama, so that he woulde let none go out or in to Asa king of Iuda.
{15:18} Then Asa toke al the siluer and golde that was left in the treasures of the house of the Lorde, and the treasures of the kinges house, and deliuered them vnto the handes of his seruauntes, and king Asa sent them to Benhadad the sonne of Tabrimon the sonne of Hezion king of Syria that dwelt at Damasco, saying:
{15:19} There is a bonde betweene me & thee, betweene my father and thy father: and beholde I haue sent vnto thee a present of siluer and golde, that thou come and breake the bonde that thou hast with Baasa king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
{15:20} So Benhadad hearkened vnto king Asa, & sent the captaynes of the hoastes which he had, against the cities of Israel, and smote Hion, and Dan, and Abel, Beth Maacah, and all the region of Ceneroth, with all the lande of Nephthali.
{15:21} And when Baasa heard thereof, he left building of Rama, and dwelt in Thirza.
{15:22} Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Iuda, that none should be excused: And so they toke the stones of Ramah and the tymber wherewith Baasa had builded, and king Asa built with them the hill of Beniamin and Mispah.
{15:23} The remnaunt of all the wordes that concerne Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he builded, are they not written in the booke of the cronicles of the kinges of Iuda? Neuerthelesse, in his olde age he was diseased in his feete.
{15:24} And Asa slept with his fathers, & was buried beside his fathers in the citie of Dauid his father: And Iehosaphat his sonne raigned in his steade.
{15:25} And Nadab the sonne of Ieroboam began to raigne vpon Israel the second yere of Asa king of Iuda, and raigned vpon Israel two yeres.
{15:26} And he did euill in ye sight of the Lord, walking in ye way of his father, & in his sinne wherewith he made Israel sinne.
{15:27} And Baasa the sonne of Ahia, which was of the house of Isachar, conspired against him, and Baasa smote him at Gibbethon, which is a citie of the Philistines (for Nadab and al Israel layed siege to Gibbethon)
{15:28} Euen in the third yere of Asa king of Iuda, did Baasa slay him, and raigned in his steade.
{15:29} And it fortuned that when he was king, he smote all the house of Ieroboam, and he left him naught that breathed, vntill he had put him cleane out, according vnto the saying of the Lorde which he spake by his seruaunt Ahia the Selonite:
{15:30} Because of the sinnes of Ieroboam, wherewith he sinned and made Israel sinne, when he with his prouocation angred the Lorde God of Israel.
{15:31} The rest of the wordes that concerne Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the booke of the cronicles of the kinges of Israel?
{15:32} And there was warre betweene Asa & Baasa king of Israel all their dayes.
{15:33} So in the third yere of Asa king of Iuda, began Baasa the sonne of Ahia to raigne ouer all Israel in Thirza, twentie and foure yeres.
{15:34} And he did that which is euill in the sight of the Lorde, walking in the way of Ieroboam, and in his sinne, wherewith he made Israel to sinne.
{16:1} Then the worde of the Lorde came to Iehu the sonne of Hanani against Baasa, saying:
{16:2} Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the duste, and made thee captayne ouer my people Israel, and thou hast walked in the way of Ieroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sinne, to anger me with their sinnes:
{16:3} Beholde, I will roote out the posteritie of Baasa, and the posteritie of his house: and will make thy house lyke the house of Ieroboa the sonne of Nabat.
{16:4} That man of Baasa which dyeth in the citie, him shall the dogges eate: and that man of him which dyeth in the fieldes, shall the foules of the ayre eate.
{16:5} The rest of the wordes that concerne Baasa, and what he did, & his power, are they not written in the booke of the cronicles of the kinges of Israel?
{16:6} And so Baasa slept with his fathers, and was buried in Thirza, and Ela his sonne raigned in his steade.
{16:7} And by the hande of the prophet Iehu the sonne of Hanani, came the worde of the Lord against Baasa, and against his house, & against all the wickednesse that he did in the sight of the Lorde, in angryng him with the worke of his owne handes, that he should be like the house of Ieroboam, and because he killed him.
{16:8} The twentie & sixth yere of Asa king of Iuda, began Ela the sonne of Baasa to raigne ouer Israel in Thirza, two yeres.
{16:9} And his seruaunt Zimri (which was captayne of halfe his charets) conspired against him as he was in Thirza drinking, and was druncken in the house of Arza, steward of his house in Thirza.
{16:10} And Zimri came, and smote him, and killed him in the twentie & seuenth yere of Asa king of Iuda, and raigned in his steade.
{16:11} And it fortuned that when he was king and sat on his seate, he slue al the house of Baasa, not leauing thereof one to pysse against a wall: Yea, he slue his kinsefolkes and freendes also.
{16:12} And thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasa, according to the worde of the Lorde, which he spake against Baasa by the hande of Iehu the prophet,
{16:13} For all the sinnes of Baasa and sinnes of Ela his sonne which they sinned, and made Israel to sinne and angre the Lorde God of Israel with their vanities.
{16:14} The rest of the wordes that concerne Ela & all that he did, are they not written in the booke of the cronicles of the kinges of Israel?
{16:15} In the twentie & seuenth yere of Asa king of Iuda, did Zimri raigne seuen dayes in Thirza: & the people was then in the hoast besieging Gibbethon, a citie of the Philistines.
{16:16} And the people in the hoast heard one saye, Zimri hath conspired, and slayne the king: Wherefore all they of Israel made Amri the captayne of the hoast, king ouer Israel that same day, euen in the hoast.
{16:17} And Amri departed vp from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Thirza.
{16:18} And when Zimri sawe that the citie must needes be taken, he went into the palace of the kinges house, and burnt him selfe & the kinges house with fyre, and so dyed
{16:19} For his sinnes which he sinned, in doing that which is euill in the sight of the Lorde, and in walking in the waye of Ieroboam, and in his sinnes which he did, and in that he made Israel to sinne.
{16:20} The rest of the wordes that concerne Zimri, & the treason that he wrought, are they not written in the booke of the cronicles of the kinges of Israel?
{16:21} Then were the people of Israel deuided into two partes: for halfe the people folowed Thibni the sonne of Ginath, making him king: and the other halfe folowed Amri.
{16:22} But the people that folowed Amri, preuayled against the people that folowed Thibni the sonne of Ginath: And so Thibni dyed, and Amri raigned.
{16:23} In the thirtie and one yere of Asa king of Iuda, began Amri to raigne ouer Israel twelue yeres: Sixe yeres raigned he in Thirza.
{16:24} He bought the hill Schomron of one Schemar for two talents of siluer, and buylt in the hill, and called the name of the citie which he buylt, after the name of Schemar, which had ben owner of the hill Schomron.
{16:25} But Amri wrought that which is euil in the eyes of the Lorde, and did worse then all that were before him.
{16:26} For he walked in all the way of Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat, and in his sinnes, that made Israel sinne, to anger the Lorde God of Israel with their vanities.
{16:27} The rest of the wordes that concerne Amri, & al that he did, and his strength that he shewed, are they not written in the booke of the cronicles of the kinges of Israel?
{16:28} And so Amri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria, & Ahab his sonne raigned in his steade.
{16:29} In the thirtie and eyght yere of Asa king of Iuda, began Ahab the sonne of Amri to raigne ouer Israel, & the same Ahab the sonne of Amri raigned ouer Israel in Samaria twentie and two yeres.
{16:30} And Ahab the sonne of Amri did euill in the sight of the Lorde aboue all that were before him.
{16:31} For it seemed vnto him but a light thing to walke in the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat: He toke Iezabel also the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonites to wyfe, and went and serued Baal, and worshipped him.
{16:32} And he reared vp an aulter for Baal in the temple of Baal which he had builded in Schomron:
{16:33} And Ahab made a groue, and proceeded further in angring the Lorde God of Israel then all the kinges of Israel that were before him.
{16:34} In his dayes did Hiel of Bethel build Iericho: He layde the foundation therof in Abiram his eldest sonne, and set vp the gates thereof in his youngest sonne Segub, according vnto the word of the Lorde which he spake by Iosuah the sonne of Nun.
{17:1} And Elias ye Thesbite, which was of the inhabiters of Gilead, sayde vnto Ahab: As the Lorde God of Israel lyueth, before whom I stande, there shalbe neither deawe nor rayne these yeres, but according to my worde.
{17:2} And the worde of the Lorde came vnto him, saying:
{17:3} Get thee hence, & turne thee eastward, and hide thy selfe in the brooke Cherith, that is, it that lyeth before Iordane.
{17:4} Thou shalt drinke of the ryuer, and I haue commaunded the rauens to feede thee there.
{17:5} And so he went, and did according vnto the word of the Lorde: for he went, and dwelt by the brooke Cherith that is before Iordane.
{17:6} And the rauens brought him bread and fleshe in the morning, and likewyse bread and fleshe in the euening: and he drancke of the brooke.
{17:7} And it chaunced after a while that the brooke dryed vp, because there fell no rayne vpon the earth.
{17:8} And the word of the Lorde came vnto him, saying:
{17:9} Up, and get thee to Zarphath, which is in Sidon, and dwell there: Beholde, I haue commaunded a wydow there to sustaine thee.
{17:10} So he arose, and went to Zarphath: and when he came to the gate of the citie, beholde the widow was there gathering of stickes: And he called to her, and said: set me I pray thee a litle water in a vessel, that I may drincke.
{17:11} And as she was going to fet it, he cryed after her, and saide: bryng me I pray thee a morsell of bread also in thyne hand.
{17:12} She sayde: As the Lorde thy God lyueth, I haue no bread redy, but euen an handful of meale in a barrel, & a litle oyle in a cruse: And beholde, I am gathering two stickes, for to go in and dresse it for me and my sonne, that we may eate it, and dye.
{17:13} And Elias saide vnto her, Feare not, go, and do as thou hast saide: but make me thereof a litle cake first of all, & bring it vnto me, and afterward make for thee and thy sonne.
{17:14} For thus saith the Lord God of Israel: The meale in the barrel shall not be wasted, neither shal the oyle in the cruse be minished, vntil the Lorde haue sent rayne vpon the earth.
{17:15} And she went, and did as Elias sayde: And she, and he, and her house, did eate a good space.
{17:16} And the meale wasted not out of the barrell, neither was the oyle spent out of the cruse, according to the word of the Lorde which he spake by the hande of Elias.
{17:17} And after these thinges, it happened that the sonne of the wyfe of the house fel sicke, & his sicknesse was so sore that there was no breath left in him.
{17:18} And she said vnto Elias: What haue I to do with thee O thou man of God? Art thou come vnto me to call my sinne againe to remembraunce, and to slay my sonne?
{17:19} He saide vnto her: geue me thy sonne. And he toke him out of her lap, & caried him vp into a loft where he abode, and layde him vpon his owne bed:
{17:20} And called vnto the Lorde, and saide: O Lorde my God, hast thou punished also this wydow with whom I dwell as a straunger, & hast slaine her sonne?
{17:21} And he stretched him selfe vpon the childe three tymes, and called vnto the Lorde, and saide: O Lorde my God, I pray thee let this childes soule come into him againe.
{17:22} And the Lord heard the voyce of Elias, & the soule of the childe came into him againe, and he reuiued.
{17:23} And Elias toke the boye, and brought him downe out of the chamber into the house, and deliuered him vnto his mother: And Elias saide, Behold, thy sonne lyueth.
{17:24} And the woman said vnto Elias: Now I knowe that thou art a man of God, and that the worde of the Lorde in thy mouth, is true.
{18:1} After processe of many dayes, the word of the Lord came to Elias in the third yere, saying: Go shewe thy selfe vnto Ahab, and I wyll sende rayne vpon the earth.
{18:2} And Elias went to shewe him selfe vnto Ahab: and there was a great famishment in Samaria.
{18:3} And Ahab called Obadia, which was the gouernour of his house: (and Obadia feared God greatly.
{18:4} For when Iezabel destroyed the prophets of the Lord, Obadia toke an hundred prophets, and hid them by fiftie in a caue, and prouided bread and water for them.)
{18:5} And Ahab saide vnto Obadia: Go into the lande, vnto all fountaines of water, and vnto all brookes, if happyly we may finde grasse to saue the horses and mules aliue, and that we destroy not some of the beastes.
{18:6} And so they deuided the lande betweene them to walke through it: Ahab went one way by him selfe, and Obadia went another way by him selfe.
{18:7} And it chaunced that as Obadia was in the way, beholde Elias met him, and he knew him, and fell on his face, and saide: Art not thou my lorde Elias?
{18:8} And he aunswered him, I am he: Go, and tel thy lorde, beholde, Elias is here.
{18:9} He saide: What haue I sinned, that thou wouldest delyuer thy seruaunt into the hande of Ahab, to slay me?
{18:10} As the Lorde thy God liueth, there is no nation or kingdome, whyther my lord hath not sent to seeke thee: And when they saide, he is not there: he toke an oth of the kingdome and nation when he found thee not.
{18:11} And now thou sayest, Go, and tell thy lorde that Elias is here.
{18:12} And assoone as I am gone from thee, the spirite of the Lorde shall carrie thee into some place that I do not knowe, and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he can not finde thee, he shall slay me: But I thy seruaunt feare the Lorde from my youth vp.
{18:13} Was it not tolde my lorde what I did, when Iezabel slue the prophets of the Lorde? how I hid an hundred men of the Lordes prophets, fiftie men in one caue, and fiftie in another, and prouided them of bread and water?
{18:14} And thou sayest, Go thou now & shewe thy lorde, beholde Elias is here: that he may slay me.
{18:15} And Elias saide: As the Lorde of hoastes liueth before whom I stand, I wyll shewe my selfe vnto him this day.
{18:16} So Obadia went to meete Ahab, and tolde him: And Ahab went to meete Elias.
{18:17} And it fortuned that when Ahab sawe Elias, he saide vnto him: Art thou he that troubleth Israel?
{18:18} He aunswered: It is not I that haue troubled Israel, but thou and thy fathers house, in that ye haue forsaken the commaundements of the Lorde, & thou hast folowed Baal.
{18:19} Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel vnto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal foure hundred and fiftie, and the prophets of the idols groues foure hundred, which eate at Iezabels table.
{18:20} So Ahab sent vnto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together vnto mount Carmel.
{18:21} And Elias came vnto all the people, and said: how long halt ye betweene two opinions? If the Lorde be God, folowe him: but if Baal be he, then go after him. And the people aunswered him not one worde.
{18:22} Then saide Elias vnto the people againe I onely remayne a prophete of the Lorde: but Baals prophets are foure hundred and fiftie.
{18:23} Let them therefore geue vs two oxen, and let them choose the one, & cut hym in peeces, and lay him on wood, and put no fire vnder: and I wyll dresse the other oxe, and laye him on wood, & wyll put no fyre vnder.
{18:24} And call ye on the name of your gods, & I wyl call on the name of the Lorde: and then the God that aunswereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people aunswered and saide, It is wel spoken.
{18:25} And Elias saide vnto the prophets of Baal: Choose you an oxe, & dresse him first, for ye are many: & call on the name of your gods, but put no fire vnder.
{18:26} And they toke the one oxe that he dyd geue them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning to noone, saying, O Baal heare vs. But there was no voyce, nor one to aunswere: And they lept vpon the aulter that they had made.
{18:27} And at noone Elias mocked them, and sayde: Crye lowde, for he is a God, peraduenture he is talking, or occupied in folowing vpon his enemies, or is in his iourney, or happyly he slepeth, and must be awaked with your crie.
{18:28} And they cried lowde, and cut them selues as their maner was with kniues & launcers, till the blood folowed on the.
{18:29} And it chaunced, that when midday was passed, they prophesied vntill the time of the euening sacrifice: But there was neither voyce, nor one to aunswere, nor any that regarded them.
{18:30} And Elias said vnto all the folke: Come to me. And all the people came to him: And he repaired the aulter of the Lord that was broken.
{18:31} And Elias toke twelue stones, according to the number of the twelue tribes of the sonnes of Iacob, vnto whom the word of the Lorde came, saying: Israel shalbe thy name.
{18:32} And with the stones he made an aulter in the name of the Lorde: And he made a ditch about the aulter, as great as would conteyne two measures of seede.
{18:33} And he put the wood in order, and hewed the oxe in peeces, and layed him on the wood, and said: Fill foure barrels with water, and powre it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.
{18:34} And he sayde: Do so againe. And they dyd so the seconde time. And he sayde againe: Do it the thirde time. And they dyd it the thirde time:
{18:35} And the water ran round about the aulter, & he filled the pitte with water also.
{18:36} And it fortuned, that when they should offer the euening sacrifice, Elias the prophete came, and sayde: Lorde God of Abraham, Isahac, and of Israel, it shalbe knowen this day that thou art the God in Israel, & that I am thy seruaunt, and that I haue done all these thinges at thy commaundement.
{18:37} Heare me O Lord, heare me, that this people may knowe that thou art the Lorde God, and that thou hast turned their heart againe nowe at the last.
{18:38} And the fire of the Lord fel, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the duste, and licked vp the water that was in the pit.
{18:39} And when all the people sawe it, they fell on their faces, and sayde: The Lord he is God, the Lorde he is God.
{18:40} And Elias sayd vnto them: Take the prophetes of Baal, and let not one of them escape. And they toke them, and Elias brought them vnto the brooke Kison, and slue them there.
{18:41} And Elias sayde vnto Ahab: Get thee vp, eate and drinke: for there is a sounde of much rayne.
{18:42} And so Ahab went vp to eate and to drinke, and Elias went vp to the top of Carmel, and he layde him selfe flat vpo the earth, and put his face betweene his knees,
{18:43} And sayde to his seruaunt: Go vp I pray thee and loke towarde the way of the sea. And he went vp, and loked, and sayde: There is nothing. And againe he sayde: Go againe seuen times.
{18:44} And it fortuned that at the seuenth time, he sayde: Beholde there aryseth a litle cloude of the sea lyke a mans hand. He sayde: Go, and say vnto Ahab, Make fast thy charet and get thee downe, that the rayne stoppe thee not.
{18:45} And it came to passe, that in the meane whyle the heauen was blacke with cloudes and winde, & there was a great rayne: And Ahab gat vp, and came to Iezrahel.
{18:46} And the hande of the Lorde was on Elias, and he girded vp his loynes, and ranne before Ahab, till he came to Iezrahel.
{19:1} And Ahab tolde Iezabel all that Elias had done, and how he had slayne al the prophetes with the sworde.
{19:2} Then Iezabel sent a messenger vnto Elias, saying: So and so let the gods do to me, if I make not thy soule lyke one of theirs by to morowe this time.
{19:3} When he sawe that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beerseba in Iuda, and left his seruaunt there.
{19:4} But he him selfe went a dayes iourney into the wildernesse, and came and sat downe vnder a Iuniper tree, and desired for his soule that he might dye, and sayde: It is nowe enough O Lorde, take my soule, for I am not better then my fathers.
{19:5} And as he lay and slept vnder the Iuniper tree: behold an angel touched him, and sayde vnto him: Up, and eate.
{19:6} And when he loked about him, beholde there was a cake baken on the coales, and a vessell of water at his head: And he dyd eate and drinke, and layde him downe againe to sleepe.
{19:7} And the angel of the Lord came againe the seconde time, and touched him, and sayde: Up, and eate, for thou hast yet a great iourney.
{19:8} And he arose, and dyd eate and drinke, & walked in the strength of that meate fourtie dayes and fourtie nightes, euen vnto Horeb the mount of God.
{19:9} When he came thyther vnto a caue, he lodged therein al night: And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and sayd vnto him: What doest thou here Elias?
{19:10} And he aunswered, I haue ben ielous for the Lorde God of hoastes sake: For the children of Israel haue forsaken thy couenaunt, broken downe thyne aulters, and slayne thy prophetes with the sword: and I onely am left, and they seke my lyfe to take it away.
{19:11} And he sayd: Come out and stand vpon ye mount before the Lorde. And behold, the Lorde went by, & a mightie strong winde that rent the mountaynes and brake the rockes before the Lorde, but the Lord was not in the winde: And after the winde, came an earthquake, but the Lorde was not in the earthquake:
{19:12} And after the earthquake came fire, but the Lorde was not in the fire: And after the fire, came a small still voyce.
{19:13} And when Elias hearde, he couered his face with his mantle, and went out, and stoode in the entring in of the caue: And beholde, there came a voyce vnto him, & said: What doest thou here Elias?
{19:14} And he aunswered: I haue ben ielous for the Lorde God of hoastes sake, because the children of Israel haue forsaken thy couenaunt, cast downe thyne aulters, and slayne thy prophetes with the sworde: and I onely am left, & they seke my lyfe to take it away.
{19:15} And the Lord sayde vnto him: Go, and turne thy way to the wildernesse vnto Damasco: & when thou commest there, annoynt Hazael king ouer Syria:
{19:16} And Iehu sonne of Nimsi shalt thou annoynt king ouer Israel: And Elisa the sonne of Saphat of Abel Meholah shalt thou annoynt to be prophete in thy roome.
{19:17} And it shall come to passe, that whoso escapeth the sworde of Hazael, him shall Iehu slay: & if any man scape the sword of Iehu, him shall Elisa put to death.
{19:18} And thereto I haue left me seuen thousande in Israel, of whiche neuer man bowed his knees vnto Baal, nor kissed him with his mouth.
{19:19} So he departed thence, & found Elisa the sonne of Saphat plowing, & hauing twelue yocke of oxen before him, and he with the twelue: And Elias went by him, and cast his mantle vpon him.
{19:20} And he left the oxen, and ranne after Elias, and sayde: Let me I pray thee kysse my father and my mother, & then I will folowe thee. He sayde vnto him: Go backe againe, for what is it that I haue done to thee?
{19:21} And when he went backe againe from him, he toke a couple of oxen, and slue them, and dressed the fleshe with the instrumentes of the oxen, and gaue vnto the people, and they dyd eate: And then he arose and went after Elias, and ministred vnto him.
{20:1} And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his hoast together, hauing thirtie & two kinges with him, and horses and charets: and went vp and besieged Samaria, & warred against it.
{20:2} And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the citie, and sayde vnto him, thus saith Benhadad.
{20:3} Thy siluer & thy gold is myne, & the fayrest of thy wiues & of thy childre be mine.
{20:4} And the king of Israel aunswered and said: My lord king, according to thy saying, I am thyne and all that I haue.
{20:5} And when the messengers came againe, they sayd, thus sayth Benhadad: Forasmuch as I haue sent vnto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliuer me thy siluer and thy golde, and thy wyues, and thy children:
{20:6} I will therfore send my seruauntes vnto thee to morowe this time: and they shall searche thyne house, & the houses of thy seruauntes, and whatsoeuer is pleasaunt in thyne eyes, they shall take it in their handes, and bring it away.
{20:7} Then the king of Israel sent for all the elders of the land, and said: Take heede I pray you, and see howe this felowe goeth about mischiefe: For he sent vnto me for my wiues, for my children, for my siluer, and for my golde, and I denyed him not.
{20:8} And all the elders and all the people said: Hearken not vnto him, nor consent.
{20:9} Wherfore he sayde vnto the messengers of Benhadad: Tell my lord the king, all that thou dyddest send for to thy seruaut at the first time, that I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought aunswere againe.
{20:10} And Benhadad sent vnto him againe, and sayde: Thus and thus do the gods vnto me, if the dust of Samaria be enough for al the people that folowe me, to take euery man an handfull.
{20:11} And the king of Israel aunswered, and sayd: Tell him, let not him that putteth on his harnesse boast him selfe, as he that putteth it of.
{20:12} And it fortuned, that when Benhadad hearde that tydinges, as he was with the kinges drinking within the pauilions, and he saide vnto this seruauntes, Put your selues in order. And they set them selues in aray against the citie.
{20:13} And beholde, there came a prophete vnto Ahab king of Israel, saying, thus sayeth the Lord: Hast thou seene all this great multitude? beholde, I will deliuer it into thyne hand this day, & thou shalt knowe that I am the Lorde.
{20:14} And Ahab sayd: By whom? He sayde: Thus sayth the Lorde, euen by the seruauntes of the gouernours of ye shyres. He sayd againe: who shall order the battayle? And he aunswered: Thou.
{20:15} Then he numbred the seruauntes of the gouernours of the shyres, & they were two hundred and thirtie and two: And after them also he numbred all the people of the children of Israel euen seuen thousande.
{20:16} And they went out at noone: but Benhadad dyd drinke till he was drunken in the pauillions, both he and the kinges: eue thirtie & two kinges, that holpe him.
{20:17} And the seruauntes of the gouernours of the shyres went out first, and Benhadad sent out, & they shewed him, saying: There are men come out of Samaria.
{20:18} He sayde: Whether they be come out for peace, take them alyue: or whether they be come out to fight, take them yet alyue.
{20:19} And so those young men of the gouernours of the shyres came out of the citie, and the hoast after them:
{20:20} And they slue euery one his enemie that came in his way: and the Syrians fled, & they of Israel folowed after the: And Benhadad the king of Syria scaped on a horse, with his horsemen.
{20:21} And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and charettes, & with a great slaughter slue he the Syrians.
{20:22} (And there came a prophete to the king of Israel, and said vnto him: Go foorth, and play the man, be wyse, & take heede what thou doest: for when the yere is gone about, the king of Syria will come vp against thee.)
{20:23} And the seruauntes of the king of Syria sayde vnto him: The gods of the hilles are their gods, and therefore they had the better of vs: but let vs fight against them in the playne, and for what ye will we shall haue the better of them.
{20:24} And this do: Take the kinges away euery man out of his place, & put dukes in their roomes:
{20:25} And do thou number thee an hoast, lyke the hoast that thou hast lost, such horses and suche charets, and we will fight against them in the plaine, and thou shalt see vs get the better of the. And he hearkened vnto their voyce, and dyd euen so.
{20:26} And it fortuned, that after the yere was gone about, Benhadad numbred the Syrians, and went vp to Aphec to fight against Israel.
{20:27} And the children of Israel were numbred, & with their whole number went they against them, and the children of Israel pitched before them lyke two litle flockes of kiddes: but the Syrians filled the countrey.
{20:28} And there came a man of God, and sayd vnto the king of Israel, thus sayth the Lorde: Because the Syrians haue sayd, the Lorde is but God of the hilles, and not God of the valleys: therfore wil I deliuer all this great multitude into thyne hande, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lorde.
{20:29} And they pitched one ouer against the other seuen dayes: and it came to passe, that in the seuenth day the battaile was ioyned, and the children of Israel slue of the Syrians an hundred thousande footemen in one day.
{20:30} But the rest fled to Aphec into the citie, and there fell a wall vpon twentie and seuen thousande of the men that were left: And Benhadad fled, and came into the citie, from chamber to chamber.
{20:31} And his seruauntes said vnto him: Behold, we haue heard say that the kinges of the house of Israel are mercyfull kinges: We will therfore put sackcloth about our loynes, and ropes about our heades, and go out to the king of Israel, if happyly he will saue thy lyfe.
{20:32} And so they girded sackcloth about their loynes, & put ropes about their heades, and came to the king of Israel, and said: Thy seruaunt Benhadad sayth, I pray thee let me lyue. He sayde: Is he yet alyue? he is my brother.
{20:33} And ye men toke that word for good lucke and hastyly caught it out of his mouth, and sayd: Yea thy brother Benhadad. He sayde: Go, bring him hyther. And Benhadad came out vnto him, and he caused him to come vp into the charet.
{20:34} And he said vnto him: The cities which my father toke from thy father, I will restore agayne, and thou shalt make streates for thee in Damasco, as my father dyd in Samaria: And I wil make an appoyntment with thee, & send the away. And so he made an appoyntment with him, and sent him away.
{20:35} And there was a certayne man of the children of the prophetes, whiche sayde vnto his neyghbour in the word of the Lord: Smyte me I pray thee. And the man woulde not smyte him.
{20:36} Then sayd he vnto him: Because thou hast not hearkened vnto the voyce of the Lorde: beholde, assoone as thou art departed fro me, a lion shal slay thee. And it came to passe, that assoone as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slue him.
{20:37} Then he founde another man, & sayde: Smyte me I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smyting he wounded him.
{20:38} So the prophete went foorth, & wayted for the king by the way, and put him selfe out of knowledge with ashes whiche he layed vpon his face.
{20:39} And when the king came by, he cryed vnto the king, and sayde: Thy seruaunt wet out in the middes of the battel, and behold there went away a man, whom another man brought vnto me, & sayde, Kepe this man: and if he be myssed or lost, thy lyfe shall go for his, or els thou shalt pay a talent of siluer.
{20:40} And as thy seruaunt had here & there to do, he was gone. And the king of Israel sayde vnto him: Euen so shall thy iudgement be, as thou hast defined it thy selfe.
{20:41} And he hasted, & toke the ashes away from his face, and the king of Israel knewe him, that he was of ye prophetes.
{20:42} And he sayde vnto him, Thus sayth the Lorde: Because thou hast let go out of thy hande a man that is in my curse, thy lyfe shall go for his lyfe, and thy people for his people.
{20:43} And the king of Israel went to his house wayward and in displeasure, and came to Samaria.
{21:1} After these thinges, it chaunced, that Naboth the Iezraelite had a vineyard in Iezrahel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
{21:2} And Ahab spake vnto Naboth, saying: Geue me thy vineyarde, that I may make me a garde of hearbes thereof, because it lyeth so nye my house, and I wil geue thee for it a better vineyarde then it is: or rather if it please thee, I will geue thee the worth of it in money.
{21:3} And Naboth sayd to Ahab: The Lord forbid that from me, that I should geue the inheritauce of my fathers vnto thee.
{21:4} And Ahab came into the house heauy and euyll apayde because of the worde whiche Naboth the Iesraelite had spoken to him, for he had sayde: I will not geue thee the inheritaunce of my fathers. And he layde him downe vpon his bed, and turned away his face, and woulde eate no bread.
{21:5} But Iezabel his wyfe came to him, and sayde vnto him: Why is thy spirite so wayward that thou eatest no bread?
{21:6} And he sayd vnto her: For I spake vnto Naboth the Iezraelite, and said vnto him, Geue me thy vineyarde for money: Or els if it please thee, I will geue thee another vineyarde for it. And he aunswered: I will not geue thee my vineyarde.
{21:7} And Iezabel his wyfe sayde vnto him: Doest thou nowe gouerne the kingdome of Israel? vp, and eate bread, and set thyne heart at rest: I wil geue thee ye vineyarde of Naboth the Iezraelite.
{21:8} And so she wrote a letter in Ahabs name, and sealed it with his seale, and sent the letter vnto the elders, and to the nobles that were in his citie dwelling with Naboth.
{21:9} And she wrote in the letter, saying: Proclayme a fast, and set Naboth on hye among the people:
{21:10} And set two vnthriftes before him, to beare witnesse against him, saying, Thou dyddest blaspheme God and the king: And then carie him out, and stone him to death.
{21:11} And the men of his citie, euen the elders and gouernours whiche dwelt in his citie, dyd as Iezabel had sent vnto them, and as it was written in the letter whiche she had sent vnto them.
{21:12} They proclaymed a fast, and set Naboth among the chiefe of the people.
{21:13} And there came in two men the children of Belial, and sate before him: And the two vnthriftie persons witnessed against Naboth in the presence of the people, saying: Naboth dyd blaspheme God and the king. And they caried him out of the citie, & stoned him with stones, that he died.
{21:14} And then they sent to Iezabel, saying: Naboth is stoned to death.
{21:15} And it fortuned, when Iezabel hearde that Naboth was stoned to death, she sayde to Ahab: Up, and take possession of the vineyarde of Naboth the Iezraelite, whiche he denied to geue for money: for Naboth is not alyue, but dead.
{21:16} And when Ahab hearde that Naboth was dead, he stoode vp to go downe to the vineyarde of Naboth the Iezraelite, and to take possession of it.
{21:17} And the worde of the Lorde came vnto Elias the Thesbite, saying:
{21:18} Up, and go downe to meete Ahab king of Israel, whiche is in Samaria: Beholde he is in the vineyarde of Naboth, whyther he is gone downe to possesse it.
{21:19} And therfore shalt thou say vnto him, thus sayth the Lorde: Hast thou killed & also gotten possession? And thou shalt speake vnto him, saying, thus sayth the Lord: In the place were dogges licked the blood of Naboth, shall dogges licke euen thy blood also.
{21:20} And Ahab sayde to Elias: Hast thou founde me, O thou myne enemie? He aunswered: I haue founde thee, for thou hast sold thy selfe to worke wickednesse in the sight of the Lorde.
{21:21} Behold, I will bring euyll vpon thee, & wil make cleane riddaunce of thy posteritie, and wil destroy fro Ahab, euen him that maketh water against the wal, and him that is shut vp, & left behind in Israel.
{21:22} And will make thyne house lyke the house of Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat, & lyke the house of Baasa the sonne of Ahia, for the prouocation wherwith thou hast prouoked, and made Israel to synne.
{21:23} And of Iezabel spake the Lord, saying: The dogges shall eate Iezabel by the wall of Iezrahel,
{21:24} And he that dieth of Ahab in ye towne, him shall dogges eate: and he that dieth in the fielde, him shal the fowles of the ayre eate.
{21:25} But there was none lyke Ahab, which dyd euen sell him selfe to worke wickednesse in the sight of the Lorde, and that because Iezabel his wyfe pricked hym forwarde.
{21:26} He dyd exceeding abhominablie in folowing foule idols, according to all thinges as dyd the Ammorites whom the Lorde cast out before the children of Israel.
{21:27} And it fortuned, that whe Ahab heard those wordes, he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth about his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth & wene bare foote.
{21:28} And the worde of the Lorde came to Elia the Thesbyte, saying:
{21:29} Seest thou howe Ahab humbleth him selfe before me? because he so submitteth him selfe before me, I wil not bring that euil in his dayes: but in his sonnes dayes will I bring euyll vpon his house.
{22:1} And they cotinued three yeres without warre betweene Syria & Israel.
{22:2} And in the third yere dyd Iehosaphat the king of Iuda come downe to the king of Israel.
{22:3} (And the king of Israel sayde vnto his seruauntes: Know ye not that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we sit still, and take it not out of the hande of the king of Syria?)
{22:4} And he sayde vnto Iehosaphat: Wilt thou come with me to battayle against Ramoth in Gilead? And Iehosaphat sayde vnto the king of Israel: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.
{22:5} And Iehosaphat sayde vnto the king of Israel: Aske counsel I pray thee at the worde of the Lorde to day.
{22:6} And then the king of Israel gathered the prophetes together, vpon a foure hundred men, & sayde vnto them: Shall I go against Ramoth in Gilead to battayle, or shall I let it alone? And they sayde, Go vp: for the Lorde shall deliuer it into the handes of the king.
{22:7} And Iehosaphat sayd: Is there here neuer a prophete of the Lord more, that we might inquire of him?
{22:8} And the king of Israel sayde vnto Iehosaphat: There is yet one man (Michea the sonne of Iimla) by whom we may aske counsell of the Lorde: But I hate him, for he doth not prophecie good vnto me, but euyll. And Iehosaphat sayde: Let not the king say so.
{22:9} Then the king of Israel called a chamberlayne, & sayde: Fet Michea the sonne of Iimla hyther at once.
{22:10} And the king of Israel, and Iehosaphat the king of Iuda, sate eyther in his seate, and their apparell on them, in a voyde place besyde the entring in of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophetes prophecied before them.
{22:11} And Zedekia the sonne of Chanaana made hornes of iron, and sayde, thus sayth the Lord: With these hornes shalt thou pushe the Syrians, vntill thou haue made an ende of them.
{22:12} And all the prophetes prophecied euen so, saying: Go vp to Ramoth in Gilead, and prosper: for the Lorde shall deliuer it into the kinges hande.
{22:13} And the messenger that was gone to cal Michea, spake vnto him, saying: Beholde, the wordes of ye prophetes speake good vnto the king with one mouth: Let thy worde therefore I pray thee, be lyke the worde of euery one of them, to speake that whiche is good.
{22:14} And Michea sayde: As the Lorde lyueth, whatsoeuer the Lord sayth vnto me, that will I speake.
{22:15} And so he came to the king, & the king sayd vnto him: Michea, ought we to go against Ramoth in Gilead to battayle, or to be stil? He aunswered to him: Go, and prosper, the Lorde shall deliuer it into the hande of the king.
{22:16} And the king sayde vnto him: So and so many times do I charge thee that thou tell me nothing but that whiche is true, in the name of the Lorde.
{22:17} He sayd: I saw all them of Israel scattered vpon the hilles, as sheepe that haue not a sheephearde. And the Lorde sayde: These haue no maister, let euery man returne to his house in peace.
{22:18} (And the king of Israel sayde vnto Iehosaphat: Dyd I not tell thee, that he woulde prophecie no good vnto me, but euyll?)
{22:19} And he sayd againe: Heare thou therefore the word of the Lorde. I sawe the Lord sit on his seate, and all the hoast of heauen stoode about him on his right hande and on his left.
{22:20} And the Lorde sayde: Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go and fall at Ramoth in Gilead? And one sayde on this maner, and another on that.
{22:21} And there came foorth a certayne spirite, and stoode before the Lorde, and sayde: I will persuade him. And the Lorde sayde vnto him: Wherwith?
{22:22} And he sayde: I will go out, and be a false spirite in the mouth of all his prophetes. He sayde, Thou shalt persuade him and preuayle: Go foorth then, & do euen so.
{22:23} Nowe therefore beholde the Lorde hath put a lying spirite in the mouth of all these thy prophetes, and the Lorde hath spoken euyll towarde thee.
{22:24} But Zedekia the sonne of Chanaana went to & smote Michea on the cheke, and sayde: When went the spirite of the Lorde from me, to speake vnto thee?
{22:25} And Michea sayde: Behold, thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go from chamber to chamber to hyde thee.
{22:26} And the king of Israel sayde: Take Michea and cary him vnto Amon the gouerner of the citie, and vnto Ioas the kinges sonne,
{22:27} And say: Thus sayeth ye king: Put this felow in the prison house, and feede him with bread of affliction, and with water of trouble, vntill I returne in peace.
{22:28} And Michea sayde: If thou returne in peace, the Lord hath not spoken by me. And he sayde: Hearken ye people euery one of you.
{22:29} And so the king of Israel, and Iehosaphat the king of Iuda, went vp to Ramoth in Gilead.
{22:30} And the king of Israel sayde vnto Iehosaphat: I wil chaunge my apparell, and will enter into the battel, but put thou on thyne apparell. And the king of Israel chaunged him selfe, and went to battell.
{22:31} But the king of Syria commaunded the thirtie and two captaynes that had rule ouer his charettes, saying: Fight neither with small nor great, saue onely against the king of Israel.
{22:32} And when the captaynes of the charets saw Iehosaphat, they sayd: Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned to fight against him: And Iehosaphat cryed.
{22:33} And so it came to passe, that when the captaynes of the charettes sawe that he was not the king of Israel, they turned backe from him.
{22:34} And a certayne man drewe a bowe ignorantly, & smote the king of Israel betweene the ribbes and his harnesse: Wherfore he sayd vnto the driuer of his charettes, Turne thy hand, and cary me out of the hoast, for I am hurt.
{22:35} (And the battel encreased that day: and the king stoode still in his charet against the Syrians) and died at euen: And the blood ran out of the wounde into the middes of the charet.
{22:36} And ther wet a proclamation throughout the hoast about the goyng downe of the sunne, saying: Euery man to his citie, and to his owne countrey.
{22:37} So the king died, and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria.
{22:38} And one washed the charet in the poole of Samaria, & the dogges licked vp his blood: and they washed his armour, according vnto the worde of the Lorde whiche he spake.
{22:39} The rest of the wordes that concerne Ahab and all that he did, and the iuorie house whiche he made, and all the cities that he buylded, are they not written in the booke of the cronicles of the kinges of Israel?
{22:40} And so Ahab slept with his fathers, & Ahazia his sonne raigned in his steade.
{22:41} Iehosaphat the sonne of Asa began to raigne vpon Iuda in the fourth yere of Ahab king of Israel.
{22:42} And Iehosaphat was thirtie and fiue yeres old when he began to raigne, and raigned twentie and fiue yeres in Hierusalem: His mothers name was Azuba the daughter of Silhi.
{22:43} And he walked in all the wayes of Asa his father, and bowed not therefrom, but dyd that whiche was right in the eyes of the Lorde: Neuerthelesse the high places were not taken out of the way: for the people offred and burnt incense yet in the high places.
{22:44} And Iehosaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
