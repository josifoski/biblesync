{1:1} In the begynnyng was the worde, & the worde was with God: and that worde was God.
{1:2} The same was in the begynnyng with God.
{1:3} All thynges were made by it: and without it, was made nothyng that was made.
{1:4} In it was lyfe, and the lyfe was the lyght of men,
{1:5} And the lyght shyneth in darkenesse: and the darknesse comprehended it not.
{1:6} There was a man sent from God, whose name was Iohn:
{1:7} The same came for a witnesse, to beare witnesse of the lyght, that all men through hym myght beleue.
{1:8} He was not that lyght: but was sent to beare witnesse of the lyght.
{1:9} That lyght was the true lyght, which lyghteth euery man that commeth into the worlde.
{1:10} He was in the worlde, and the worlde was made by hym, and the worlde knewe hym not.
{1:11} He came among his owne, and his owne receaued hym not.
{1:12} But as many as receaued hym, to them gaue he power to be the sonnes of God, euen them that beleued on his name.
{1:13} Which were borne, not of blood, nor of the wyll of the fleshe, nor yet of the wyll of man, but of God.
{1:14} And the same word became fleshe, and dwelt among vs ( and we sawe the glory of it, as the glory of the only begotten sonne of the father) full of grace and trueth.
{1:15} Iohn beareth witnesse of hym, and cryeth, saying: This was he of whom I spake, he that commeth after me, is preferred before me, for he was before me.
{1:16} And of his fulnesse haue all we receaued, and grace for grace.
{1:17} For the lawe was geuen by Moyses: but grace and trueth came by Iesus Christe.
{1:18} No man hath seene God at any tyme: The onely begotten sonne which is in the bosome of the father, he hath declared hym.
{1:19} And this is the recorde of Iohn: When the Iewes sent priestes and leuites from Hierusalem, to aske hym: What art thou?
{1:20} And he confessed and denyed not, and sayde playnely, I am not that Christe.
{1:21} And they asked hym: What then? art thou Elias? And he sayth, I am not. Art thou that prophete? And he aunswered, no.
{1:22} Then sayde they vnto hym: What art thou? that we may geue an aunswere to them that sent vs: What sayest thou of thy selfe?
{1:23} He sayde: I am the voyce of a cryer in the wildernesse, make strayght the way of the Lorde, as sayde the prophete Esaias.
{1:24} And they which were sent, were of the pharisees.
{1:25} And they asked hym, and sayde vnto hym: Why baptizest thou then, yf thou be not Christe, nor Elias, neither that prophete?
{1:26} Iohn aunswered them, saying: I baptize with water, but there standeth one among you, whom ye knowe not,
{1:27} He it is, which though he came after me, was before me, whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to vnloose.
{1:28} These thynges were done in Bethabara beyonde Iordane, where Iohn dyd baptize.
{1:29} The next day, Iohn seeth Iesus comming vnto hym, and saith, beholde the lambe of God, which taketh away the sinne of the worlde.
{1:30} This is he of whom I sayde, After me commeth a man, which is preferred before me, for he was before me.
{1:31} And I knewe hym not: but that he shoulde be declared to Israel, therfore am I come, baptizing with water.
{1:32} And Iohn bare recorde, saying: I sawe the spirite descende from heauen, lyke vnto a doue, and abode vpon hym,
{1:33} And knewe hym not. But he that sent me to baptize with water, the same saide vnto me: vpon whom thou shalt see the spirite descende, and tary styll on hym, the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost.
{1:34} And I sawe, and bare recorde, that he is the sonne of God.
{1:35} The next day after, Iohn stoode agayne, and two of his disciples.
{1:36} And he behelde Iesus as he walked by, & sayth: beholde the lambe of God.
{1:37} And the two disciples hearde hym speake, and they folowed Iesus.
{1:38} And Iesus turned about, and sawe them folowe hym, & sayth vnto them: What seeke ye? They sayde vnto hym: Rabbi (which is to say yf one interprete it, Maister) where dwellest thou?
{1:39} He sayeth vnto them: come and see. They came, and sawe where he dwelt, and abode with hym that day: For it was about the tenth houre.
{1:40} One of the two which hearde Iohn speake, & folowed hym, was Andrewe, Simon Peters brother.
{1:41} The same founde his brother Simon first, and sayth vnto hym: We haue founde Messias, which is by interpretation, the annoynted.
{1:42} And brought hym to Iesus. And Iesus behelde hym, and sayde: Thou art Simon the sonne of Iona, thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, a stone.
{1:43} The day folowyng, Iesus woulde go into Galilee, & founde Philip, and sayth vnto hym, folowe me.
{1:44} Philip was of Bethsaida, the citie of Andrewe and Peter.
{1:45} Philip founde Nathanael, and sayth vnto hym: We haue founde hym, of whom Moyses in the lawe, and the prophetes, dyd write: Iesus of Nazareth, the sonne of Ioseph.
{1:46} And Nathanael sayde vnto hym: Can there any good thyng come out of Nazareth? Philip sayth vnto him: come and see.
{1:47} Iesus sawe Nathanael commyng to hym, & sayeth of hym: Beholde a ryght Israelite, in whom is no guile.
{1:48} Nathanael sayth vnto hym: Whence knewest thou me? Iesus aunswered, and sayde vnto hym: Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast vnder the fygge tree, I sawe thee.
{1:49} Nathanael aunswered, and sayde vnto hym: Rabbi, thou art euen the very sonne of God, thou art ye kyng of Israel.
{1:50} Iesus aunswered, & sayde vnto hym: Because I sayde vnto thee, I saw thee vnder the fygge tree, thou beleuest: Thou shalt see greater thynges then these.
{1:51} And he sayth vnto hym: Ueryly, veryly I say vnto you, hereafter shall ye see heauen open, and the Angels of God ascendyng & descendyng vpon the sonne of man.
{2:1} And the thirde day, was there a mariage in Cana a citie of Galilee, and the mother of Iesus was there.
{2:2} And Iesus was called, and his disciples vnto the mariage.
{2:3} And whe the wyne fayled, the mother of Iesus sayth vnto hym: they haue no wyne.
{2:4} Iesus saith vnto her: Woman, what haue I to do with thee, myne houre is not yet come.
{2:5} His mother sayth vnto the ministers: Whatsoeuer he sayth vnto you, do it.
{2:6} And there were set there, sixe water pottes of stone, after the maner of the purifiyng of the Iewes, conteynyng two or three firkins a peece.
{2:7} Iesus sayth vnto them: fyll the water pottes with water. And they fylled them vp to the brym.
{2:8} And he sayth vnto them: drawe out nowe, and beare vnto the gouernour of feast. And they bare it.
{2:9} When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wyne, and knewe not whence it was (but the ministers which drewe the water knewe) the gouernour of the feast calleth the brydegrome:
{2:10} And sayth vnto hym, Euery man at the begynnyng doth set foorth good wine, and when men haue well dronke, then that which is worse: But thou hast kept the good wyne vntyll nowe.
{2:11} This begynnyng of miracles dyd Iesus in Cana of Galilee, and shewed his glory, & his disciples beleued on hym.
{2:12} After this, he went downe to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples, and there continued not many dayes.
{2:13} And the Iewes Passouer was at hande, & Iesus went vp to Hierusalem,
{2:14} And founde sittyng in the temple, those that solde oxen, and sheepe, and doues, and chaungers of money.
{2:15} And when he had made as it were a scourge of small cordes, he droue them all out of the temple, with the sheepe, & oxen, and powred out the chaungers money, and ouerthrewe the tables,
{2:16} And saide vnto them that solde doues: Haue these thinges hence, and make not my fathers house an house of marchaundize.
{2:17} And his disciples remembred that it was written: The zeale of thine house hath euen eaten me.
{2:18} Then aunswered the Iewes, & sayde vnto hym: What token shewest thou vnto vs, seeyng that thou doest these thynges?
{2:19} Iesus aunswered, & sayde vnto them: Destroy this temple, & in three dayes I wyll reare it vp.
{2:20} Then sayde the Iewes, fourtie and sixe yeres was this temple a buildyng, and wilt thou reare it vp in three dayes?
{2:21} But he spake of the temple of his body.
{2:22} Assoone therfore, as he was rysen from death agayne, his disciples remembred that he thus had sayde: And they beleued the scripture, & the wordes which Iesus had sayde.
{2:23} When he was in Hierusalem at the Passouer, in the feast day, many beleued on his name, when they sawe his miracles which he dyd.
{2:24} But Iesus dyd not commit hym selfe vnto them, because he knewe all men,
{2:25} And neded not, that any shoulde testifie of man: For he knewe what was in man.
{3:1} There was a man of the pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Iewes.
{3:2} The same came to Iesus by night, & said vnto him: Rabbi, we knowe that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man coulde do these miracles that thou doest, except God were with him.
{3:3} Iesus aunswered, & sayde vnto hym: Ueryly, veryly, I say vnto thee, except a man be borne agayne, he can not see the kyngdome of God.
{3:4} Nicodemus sayth vnto hym: Howe can a man be borne when he is olde? can he enter into his mothers wombe, and be borne agayne?
{3:5} Iesus aunswered: Ueryly, veryly, I say vnto thee, except a man be borne of water and of the spirite, he can not enter into the kyngdome of God.
{3:6} That which is borne of the fleshe, is fleshe: and that which is borne of the spirite, is spirite.
{3:7} Maruayle not thou that I sayde to thee, ye must be borne agayne.
{3:8} The wynde bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sounde therof: but canst not tell whence it commeth, and whither it goeth. So is euery one that is borne of the spirite.
{3:9} Nicodemus aunswered, and sayde vnto hym: howe can these thynges be?
{3:10} Iesus aunswered, & sayde vnto hym: Art thou a maister in Israel, and knowest not thesethynges?
{3:11} Ueryly, veryly, I say vnto thee, we speake that we do knowe, & testifie that we haue seene: and ye receaue not our witnesse.
{3:12} If I haue tolde you earthly thynges, and ye beleue not: howe shall ye beleue, yf I tell you of heauenly thynges?
{3:13} And no man ascendeth vp to heauen, but he that came downe from heauen, euen the sonne of man which is in heauen.
{3:14} And as Moyses lyft vp the serpent in the wyldernesse: euen so must the sonne of man be lyft vp:
{3:15} That whosoeuer beleueth in hym, perishe not, but haue eternall lyfe.
{3:16} For God so loued the worlde, that he gaue his only begotten sonne, that whosoeuer beleueth in hym, shoulde not perishe, but haue euerlastyng lyfe.
{3:17} For God sent not his sonne into the worlde, to condempne the worlde: but that the worlde through hym myght be saued. He that beleueth on hym, is not condempned:
{3:18} But he that beleueth not, is condempned alredy, because he hath not beleued in the name of the only begotte sonne of God.
{3:19} And this is the condempnation: that lyght is come into the worlde, and men loued darknesse rather then lyght, because their deedes were euyll.
{3:20} For euery one that euyll doeth, hateth the lyght: neither commeth to the light, lest his deedes shoulde be reproued.
{3:21} But he that doeth trueth, cometh to the lyght, yt his deedes may be knowen, howe that they are wrought in God.
{3:22} After these thynges, came Iesus and his disciples into the lande of Iurie, and there he taryed with the, & baptized.
{3:23} And Iohn also baptized in Enon, besides Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
{3:24} For Iohn was not yet cast into prison.
{3:25} And there arose a question betwene Iohns disciples and the Iewes, about purifiyng.
{3:26} And they came vnto Iohn, and sayde vnto hym: Rabbi, he that was with thee beyonde Iordane, to whom thou barest witnesse, beholde the same baptizeth, and all men come to hym.
{3:27} Iohn aunswered, and sayde: A man can receaue nothyng, except it be geuen hym from heauen.
{3:28} Ye your selues are witnesses, howe that I sayde I am not Christe, but am sent before hym.
{3:29} He that hath ye bride, is the bridegrome. But the friende of the brydegrome, which standeth & heareth him, reioyceth greatly because of ye brydegromes voyce. This my ioy therfore is fulfylled.
{3:30} He must increace, but I must decreace.
{3:31} He that commeth from an hye, is aboue all: He that is of the earth, is earthlye, and speaketh of the earth. He that commeth from heauen, is aboue all:
{3:32} And what he hath seene and hearde, that he testifieth: and no man receaueth his testimonie.
{3:33} He that hath receaued his testimonie, hath set to his seale, that God is true.
{3:34} For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the wordes of God: For God geueth not the spirite by measure vnto hym.
{3:35} The father loueth the sonne, and hath geuen all thynges into his hande.
{3:36} He that beleueth on the sonne, hath euerlastyng lyfe: He that beleueth not the sonne, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abydeth on hym.
{4:1} Assoone as the Lord knew, how the pharisees had heard that Iesus made and baptized mo disciples then Iohn,
{4:2} (Though that Iesus hym selfe baptized not, but his disciples:)
{4:3} He left Iurie, and departed agayne into Galilee.
{4:4} For it was so that he must needes go through Samaria.
{4:5} Then came he to a citie of Samaria, which is called Sichar, besydes the possession that Iacob gaue to his sonne Ioseph.
{4:6} And there was Iacobs well. Iesus then beyng wery of his iourney, sate thus on the well. And it was about the sixt houre:
{4:7} And there came a woman of Samaria to drawe water: Iesus sayth vnto her, geue me drynke.
{4:8} For his disciples were gone away, vnto the towne to bye meate.
{4:9} Then sayth the woman of Samaria vnto hym: Howe is it, that thou beyng a Iewe, askest drynke of me, which am a Samaritane? For the Iewes meddle not with the Samaritanes.
{4:10} Iesus aunswered, and sayde vnto her: yf thou knewest the gyft of God, & who it is that sayeth to thee geue me drynke, thou wouldest haue asked of hym, and he woulde haue geuen thee water of lyfe.
{4:11} The woman sayth vnto hym: Syr, thou hast nothyng to drawe with, and the well is deepe: from whence then hast thou that water of lyfe?
{4:12} Art thou greater then our father Iacob, which gaue vs the well, and he hym selfe dranke therof, and his chyldren, and his cattell?
{4:13} Iesus aunswered, and sayde vnto her: Whosoeuer drynketh of this water, shal thyrst agayne:
{4:14} But whosoeuer drynketh of the water that I shall geue hym, shall neuer be more a thyrst: but the water that I shall geue him, shalbe in him a well of water, spryngyng vp into euerlastyng lyfe.
{4:15} The woman sayth vnto hym: Syr, geue me of that water, that I thyrst not, neither come hyther to drawe.
{4:16} Iesus sayth vnto her: Go, call thy husbande, and come hyther.
{4:17} The woman aunswered, and sayde vnto hym: I haue no husbande. Iesus sayde vnto her: Thou hast well sayde, I haue no husbande.
{4:18} For thou hast had fyue husbandes, and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husbande. In that saydest thou truely.
{4:19} The woman sayth vnto hym: Syr, I perceaue that thou art a prophete.
{4:20} Our fathers worshipped in this mountayne, and ye say that in Hierusalem is the place, where men ought to worshippe.
{4:21} Iesus sayth vnto her: woman beleue me, the houre commeth, when ye shall neither in this mountayne, nor yet at Hierusalem, worshippe the father.
{4:22} Ye worshippe ye wote not what. We knowe what we worshippe: For saluation commeth of the Iewes.
{4:23} But the houre commeth, and nowe is, when the true worshippers, shall worshippe the father in spirite, and in the trueth: For such the father also requireth to worshippe hym.
{4:24} God is a spirite, and they that worshippe hym, must worshippe hym in spirite, and in the trueth.
{4:25} The woman sayth vnto hym, I wote that Messias shal come, which is called Christe: when he is come, he wyll tell vs all thynges.
{4:26} Iesus sayth vnto her: I that speake vnto thee, am he.
{4:27} And immediatly came his disciples, and marueyled that he talked with the woman: Yet no man saide, what seekest thou, or why talkest thou with her?
{4:28} The woman then left her water pot, and went her way into the citie, & sayth to the men:
{4:29} Come, see a man which tolde me all thynges that euer I dyd: Is not he Christe?
{4:30} Then they went out of the citie, and came vnto hym.
{4:31} In the meane whyle his disciples prayed hym, saying: Maister, eate.
{4:32} He sayde vnto them: I haue meate to eate that ye wote not of.
{4:33} Therfore sayde the disciples among them selues: Hath any man brought hym ought to eate?
{4:34} Iesus sayth vnto them: my meate is to do the wyll of hym that sent me, and to finishe his worke.
{4:35} Say not ye, there are yet foure monethes, and then commeth haruest? Beholde, I say vnto you, lyft vp your eyes, and loke on the regions: for they are whyte alredy vnto haruest.
{4:36} And he that reapeth, receaueth wages, and gathereth fruite vnto lyfe eternall: that both he that soweth, & he that reapeth, myght reioyce together.
{4:37} And herein is the saying true, that one soweth, and another reapeth.
{4:38} I sent you to reape that, wheron ye bestowed no labour. Other men laboured, and ye are entred into their labours.
{4:39} Many of the Samaritanes of that citie beleued on hym, for the saying of the woman, which testified that he tolde her all that euer she dyd.
{4:40} So, when the Samaritanes were come vnto hym, they besought hym that he would tary with them: And he abode there two dayes.
{4:41} And many mo beleued, because of his owne worde,
{4:42} And sayde vnto the woman: Nowe we beleue, not because of thy saying: for we haue heard him our selues, & know that this is euen Christe, the sauiour of the worlde.
{4:43} After two dayes he departed thence, and went away into Galilee.
{4:44} For Iesus hym selfe testified, that a prophete hath none honour in his owne countrey.
{4:45} Then, assoone as he was come into Galilee, the Galileans receaued hym, when they had seene all the thynges that he dyd at Hierusalem, at the day of the feast. For they went also vnto the feast day.
{4:46} So Iesus came agayne into Cana of Galilee, where he turned the water into wyne. And there was a certayne ruler, whose sonne was sicke at Capernaum.
{4:47} Assoone as the same hearde that Iesus was come out of Iurie into Galilee, he went vnto hym, and besought hym that he woulde come downe, and heale his sonne: For he was euen at the poynt of death.
{4:48} Then sayde Iesus vnto hym: except ye see signes and wonders, ye wyll not beleue.
{4:49} The ruler sayth vnto hym: Syr, come downe or euer that my sonne dye.
{4:50} Iesus sayth vnto hym: Go thy way, thy sonne lyueth. The man beleued the worde that Iesus had spoken vnto hym, and he went his way.
{4:51} And as he was nowe goyng downe, the seruauntes met hym, and tolde him, saying, thy sonne lyueth.
{4:52} Then enquired he of them the houre, when he began to amende. And they sayde vnto hym: Yesterday at the seuenth houre, the feuer left hym.
{4:53} So the father knewe, that it was the same houre, in the which Iesus sayde vnto hym thy sonne lyueth: And he beleued, and all his householde.
{4:54} This is agayne the seconde miracle, that Iesus dyd, when he was come out of Iurie into Galilee.
{5:1} After this, was there a feast day of the Iewes, and Iesus went vp to Hierusalem.
{5:2} And there is at Hierusalem by the sheepe market, a poole, which is called in the Hebrue tonge Bethesda, hauyng fyue porches.
{5:3} In which lay a great multitude of sicke folke, of blynde, halt, & wythered, waytyng for the mouyng of the water.
{5:4} For an Angel went downe at a certayne season into the poole, and stirred the water: Whosoeuer then firste after the stirring of the water stepped in, was made whole of whatsoeuer disease he hadde.
{5:5} And a certaine man was there, which had ben diseased thirtie & eyght yeres.
{5:6} When Iesus sawe hym lye, & knewe that he nowe long tyme had ben diseased, he sayth vnto hym: Wylt thou be made whole?
{5:7} The sicke man aunswered him: Sir, I haue no man whe the water is troubled to put me into the poole: But in the meane time, while I am about to come, another steppeth downe before me.
{5:8} Iesus saith vnto him: Ryse, take vp thy bedde, and walke.
{5:9} And immediatly the man was made whole, and toke vp his bedde, & walked. And the same day was the Sabboth.
{5:10} The Iewes therfore sayde vnto hym that was made whole: It is the Sabboth day, it is not lawfull for thee to carie thy bedde.
{5:11} He aunswered them: He that made me whole, saide vnto me, take vp thy bedde and walke.
{5:12} Then asked they hym: What man is that which sayde vnto thee, take vp thy bedde, and walke?
{5:13} And he that was healed, wyste not who it was. For Iesus had gotten him selfe awaye, because that there was prease of people in that place.
{5:14} Afterwarde, Iesus founde hym in the temple, and saide vnto him: behold, thou art made whole, sinne no more, lest a worse thyng come vnto you.
{5:15} The man departed, & tolde the Iewes that it was Iesus which had made him whole.
{5:16} And therefore the Iewes dyd persecute Iesus, and sought the meanes to slea hym, because he hadde done these thynges on the Sabboth day.
{5:17} And Iesus aunswered them: My father worketh hitherto, and I worke.
{5:18} Therfore the Iewes sought the more to kyll him, not only because he had broken the Sabboth, but sayde also, that God was his father, and made himselfe equall with God.
{5:19} Then aunswered Iesus, & sayde vnto them: Ueryly veryly I say vnto you, the sonne can do nothyng of hym selfe, but that he seeth ye father do: For whatsoeuer he doeth, that doeth the sonne also.
{5:20} For the father loueth the sonne, and sheweth hym all thynges that he hym selfe doeth: And he wyll shewe hym greater workes then these, because ye shoulde marueyle.
{5:21} For lykewyse as the father rayseth vp the dead, and quickeneth them: euen so, the sonne quickeneth whom he wyll.
{5:22} Neither iudgeth the father any man: but hath committed all iudgement vnto the sonne,
{5:23} Because that all men shoulde honour the sonne, euen as they honour the father. He that honoureth not the sonne, the same honoureth not ye father which hath sent hym.
{5:24} Ueryly veryly I say vnto you, he that heareth my worde, and beleueth on him that sent me, hath euerlastyng lyfe, and shall not come into dampnation, but is escaped from death vnto lyfe.
{5:25} Ueryly veryly I saye vnto you, the houre shall come, and nowe is, when the dead shall heare the voyce of the sonne of God: And they that heare, shall lyue.
{5:26} For as the father hath lyfe in hym selfe: so lykewyse hath he geuen to the sonne, to haue lyfe in hym selfe:
{5:27} And hath geuen hym power also to iudge, because he is the sonne of man.
{5:28} Marueyle not at this: For the houre shall come, in the whiche all that are in the graues shall heare his voyce.
{5:29} And shall come foorth, they that haue done good, vnto the resurrection of lyfe, and they that haue done euyll, vnto the resurrection of dampnation.
{5:30} I can of mine owne selfe do nothing: As I heare I iudge, and my iudgemet is iuste, because I seke not myne owne wyll, but the wyll of the father whiche hath sent me.
{5:31} Yf I shoulde beare witnesse of my selfe, my witnesse were not true.
{5:32} There is another that beareth witnesse of me, and I am sure that the witnesse which he beareth of me is true.
{5:33} Ye sent vnto Iohn, and he bare witnesse vnto the trueth.
{5:34} But I receaue not the recorde of man: Neuerthelesse, these thinges I say, that ye myght be safe.
{5:35} He was a burnyng & a shynyng lyght, and ye would for a season haue reioyced in his lyght.
{5:36} But I haue greater witnesse, then the witnesse of Iohn: For the workes whiche the father hath geuen me to finishe, the same workes that I do, beare witnesse of me, that the father hath sent me.
{5:37} And the father hymselfe which hath sent me, hath borne witnesse of me. Ye haue not hearde his voyce at any tyme, nor seene his shape,
{5:38} His worde haue ye not abydyng in you: For who he hath set, him ye beleue not.
{5:39} Searche the scriptures, for in them ye thynke ye haue eternall lyfe: and they are they which testifie of me.
{5:40} And yet wyll ye not come to me, that ye myght haue lyfe.
{5:41} I receaue not prayse of men.
{5:42} But I knowe you, that ye haue not the loue of God in you.
{5:43} I am come in my fathers name, and ye receaue me not. Yf another come in his owne name, hym wyll ye receaue.
{5:44} Howe can ye beleue, whiche receaue honour one of another, and seke not the honour that commeth of God only?
{5:45} Do not thinke that I wyll accuse you to my father: There is one that accuseth you, euen Moyses, in who ye trust.
{5:46} For had ye beleued Moyses, ye would haue beleued me: for he wrote of me.
{5:47} But yf ye beleue not his wrytynges, howe shall ye beleue my wordes?
{6:1} After these thynges, Iesus went his waye ouer the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
{6:2} And a great multitude folowed hym, because they sawe his miracles whiche he dyd on them that were diseased.
{6:3} And Iesus went vp into a mountayne, & there he sate with his disciples.
{6:4} And the Passouer, a feast of ye Iewes, was nye.
{6:5} When Iesus then lyft vp his eyes, and sawe a great company come vnto him, he saith vnto Philip: Whence shal we bye bread, that these may eate?
{6:6} (This he sayde to proue hym: for he hym selfe knewe what he woulde do.)
{6:7} Philip aunswered hym: Two hundred penie worth of bread are not sufficient for them, that euery man may take a litle.
{6:8} One of his disciples, Andrewe, Simo Peters brother, sayth vnto hym:
{6:9} There is a litle ladde here, whiche hath fyue barly loaues and two fisshes, but what are they among so many?
{6:10} And Iesus sayde: Make the people syt downe. There was much grasse in the place. So the men sate downe, in number about fyue thousande.
{6:11} And Iesus toke the bread, and when he had geue thankes, he gaue to the disciples, and the disciples to them yt were set downe, and lykewyse of the fisshes, as much as they woulde.
{6:12} When they had eaten enough, he saide vnto his disciples: Gather vp the broke meate that remayneth, that nothyng be lost.
{6:13} And they gathered it together, & fylled twelue baskettes with the broken meate of the fyue barly loaues, whiche broken meate remayned vnto them that had eaten.
{6:14} Then those men, when they had seene the miracle that Iesus did, saide: This is of a trueth the same prophete that shoulde come into the worlde.
{6:15} When Iesus therfore perceaued, that they would come and take him, to make hym kyng, he departed agayne into amountayne hym selfe alone.
{6:16} And when euen was nowe come, his disciples went downe vnto the sea.
{6:17} And gat vp into a shippe, and went ouer the sea, towardes Capernau: And it was nowe darke, and Iesus was not come to them.
{6:18} And the sea arose, with a great wynde that blewe.
{6:19} So, when they had rowed about 25 or 30 furlonges, they sawe Iesus walkyng on the sea, and drawyng nye vnto the shippe, and they were afrayde.
{6:20} But he sayth vnto them: It is I, be not afrayde.
{6:21} And they wyllyngly receaued hym into the shippe, and immediatly the shippe was at the lande whyther they went.
{6:22} The day folowyng, when the people, whiche stoode on the other syde of the sea, sawe that there was none other shippe there, saue that one whereinto his disciples were entred, and that Iesus went not in with his disciples into the shippe, but that his disciples were gone awaye alone:
{6:23} Howebeit there came other shippes fro Tiberias, nye vnto the place, where they dyd eate bread, after that the Lord had geuen thankes.
{6:24} When the people therefore sawe that Iesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also toke shippyng, and came to Capernaum, sekyng for Iesus.
{6:25} And whe they had founde hym on the other side of the sea, they said vnto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hyther? Iesus aunswered them, and sayde:
{6:26} Ueryly veryly I say vnto you, ye seke me, not because ye sawe the miracles, but because ye dyd eate of the loaues, & were fylled.
{6:27} Labour not for the meate whiche perisheth, but for that whiche endureth vnto euerlastyng lyfe, which meate the sonne of man shall geue vnto you: For hym hath God the father sealed.
{6:28} Then saide they vnto him: What shall we do, that we myght worke ye workes of God?
{6:29} Iesus aunswered, & sayde vnto them: This is the worke of God, that ye beleue on hym whom he hath sent.
{6:30} They said therfore vnto hym: What signe shewest thou then, yt we may see, & beleue thee? What doest thou worke?
{6:31} Our fathers dyd eate Manna in the desert, as it is written: He gaue them bread from heauen to eate.
{6:32} Then Iesus sayde vnto them: Ueryly veryly I say vnto you, Moyses gaue you not yt bread fro heauen, but my father geueth you ye true bread fro heaue.
{6:33} For the bread of God, is he which cometh downe from heauen, and geueth lyfe vnto the worlde.
{6:34} Then sayde they vnto hym: Lorde, euermore geue vs this bread.
{6:35} And Iesus sayde vnto them, I am the bread of lyfe: He that cometh to me, shall not hunger: and he that beleueth on me, shall neuer thirst.
{6:36} But I say vnto you, that ye also haue seene me, and yet ye beleue not.
{6:37} All that the father geueth me, shall come to me: and hym that commeth to me, I cast not away.
{6:38} For I came downe from heauen, not to do that I wyll: but that he wyll, which hath sent me.
{6:39} And this is the fathers wyll whiche hath sent me: that of all which he hath geuen me, I shal lose nothing, but rayse it vp agayne at the last day.
{6:40} And this is the wyll of him yt sent me: that euery one which seeth the sonne, & beleueth on him, hath euerlastyng lyfe: And I wyll rayse him vp at ye last day.
{6:41} The Iewes then murmured at him, because he sayde, I am the bread of life which came downe from heauen.
{6:42} And they saide: Is not this Iesus, ye sonne of Ioseph, whose father and mother we knowe? Howe is it then that he sayth, I came downe from heauen?
{6:43} Iesus aunswered, & sayde vnto them: Murmure not among your selues.
{6:44} No man can come to me, except the father, whiche hath sent me, drawe hym: And I wyll rayse hym vp at the last day.
{6:45} It is written in the prophetes: And they shalbe all taught of God. Euery man therfore that hath heard, and hath learned of the father, cometh vnto me.
{6:46} Not that any man hath seene the father, saue he which is of God, the same hath seene the father.
{6:47} Ueryly veryly I say vnto you, he that putteth his trust in me, hath euerlasting lyfe.
{6:48} I am that bread of lyfe.
{6:49} Your fathers dyd eate Manna in the wyldernesse, and are dead.
{6:50} This is that bread, which commeth downe from heauen, that yf any man eate therof, he shoulde not dye.
{6:51} I am that lyuyng bread, which came downe from heauen. Yf any man eate of this bread, he shall lyue for euer. And the bread that I wyl geue, is my fleshe, whiche I wyll geue for the lyfe of the worlde.
{6:52} The Iewes therefore stroue among them selues, saying: Howe can this felowe geue vs that fleshe of his to eate?
{6:53} Then Iesus saide vnto them: Ueryly veryly I saye vnto you, excepte ye eate the fleshe of the sonne of man, and drynke his blood, ye haue no lyfe in you.
{6:54} Who so eateth my fleshe, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall lyfe, and I wyl rayse hym vp at the last day.
{6:55} For my fleshe is meate in deede, and my blood is drynke in deede.
{6:56} He that eateth my fleshe, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, & I in hym.
{6:57} As the lyuing father hath sent me, and I lyue by the father: Euen so, he that eateth me, shal liue by the meanes of me.
{6:58} This is that bread, which came downe from heauen: Not as your fathers dyd eate Manna, and are dead. He that eateth of this bread, shall lyue euer.
{6:59} These thynges sayde he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
{6:60} Many therfore of his disciples, when they had hearde this, saide: This is an harde saying, who can abyde the hearyng of it?
{6:61} Iesus knewe in hym selfe, that his disciples murmured at it, and he sayde vnto them, doth this offende you?
{6:62} What and yf ye shall see the sonne of man ascende vp thyther where he was before?
{6:63} It is the spirite that quickeneth, the fleshe profiteth nothyng. The wordes that I speake vnto you, are spirite and lyfe.
{6:64} But there are some of you that beleue not. For Iesus knewe from the begynning, which they were that beleued not, and who shoulde betray hym.
{6:65} And he sayde: Therfore saide I vnto you, that no man can come vnto me, except it were geue vnto him of my father.
{6:66} From that time, many of his disciples wet backe, & walked no more with him.
{6:67} Then sayde Iesus vnto the twelue: Wyll ye also go away?
{6:68} Then Simon Peter aunswered him: Lorde, to who shall we go? Thou hast the wordes of eternall lyfe:
{6:69} And we beleue and are sure that thou art Christe, the sonne of ye lyuyng God.
{6:70} Iesus aunswereth them: Haue not I chosen you twelue, and one of you is a deuyll?
{6:71} He spake of Iudas Iscariot the sonne of Simon: For he it was, that shoulde betray hym, beyng one of the twelue.
{7:1} After these thynges, Iesus went about in Galilee: For he would not go about in Iurie, because that the Iewes sought to kyll hym.
{7:2} The Iewes feaste of tabernacles was at hande.
{7:3} His brethren therfore sayde vnto him: Get thee hence, and go into Iurie, that thy disciples also may see thy workes that thou doest.
{7:4} For there is no man that doeth any thyng in secrete, and he hym selfe seketh to be knowen openly. Yf thou do suche thynges, shewe thy selfe to the worlde.
{7:5} For his brethren beleued not in hym.
{7:6} Then Iesus sayde vnto them, My tyme is not yet come: but your tyme is alway redy.
{7:7} The worlde can not hate you, but me it hateth, because I testifie of it, that the workes therof are euyll.
{7:8} Go ye vp vnto this feast: I wyll not go vp yet vnto this feast, for my tyme is not yet full come.
{7:9} When he had saide these wordes vnto them, he abode styll in Galilee.
{7:10} But assoone as his brethre were gone vp, then went he also vp vnto the feaste, not openly, but as it were priuilie.
{7:11} Then sought hym the Iewes at the feaste, and sayde, where is he?
{7:12} And much murmuryng of hym was there among the people: For some said, he is good: other sayde, nay, but he deceaueth the people.
{7:13} Howebeit, no man spake openlye of hym, for feare of the Iewes.
{7:14} Nowe when halfe of the feast was done, Iesus went vp into the temple, and taught.
{7:15} And the Iewes marueyled, saying: howe knoweth he the scriptures, seyng that he neuer learned?
{7:16} Iesus aunswered them, & sayde: My doctrine is not myne, but his yt sent me.
{7:17} Yf any man wyll do his wyll, he shall knowe of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speake of my selfe.
{7:18} He that speaketh of hym selfe, seketh his owne praise: But he that seketh his praise that sent hym, the same is true, & no vnryghteousnes is in hym.
{7:19} Dyd not Moyses geue you a lawe, & yet none of you kepeth the lawe? Why go ye about to kyll me?
{7:20} The people aunswered and sayde: Thou hast the deuyll, who goeth about to kyll thee?
{7:21} Iesus aunswered, & said vnto the: I haue done one worke, & ye al marueyle.
{7:22} Moyses therefore gaue vnto you the circumcisio (not because it is of Moyses, but of the fathers) And yet ye on the Sabboth day, circumcise a man.
{7:23} Yf a man on the Sabboth day receaue circumcision, without breakyng of the lawe of Moyses: disdayne ye at me, because I haue made a man euerywhyt whole on the Sabboth day?
{7:24} Iudge not after the vtter appearaunce, but iudge with a ryghteous iudgement.
{7:25} The sayde some of them of Hierusale: Is not this he, whom they go about to kyll?
{7:26} But loe, he speaketh boldly, & they saye nothyng to hym. Do the rulers knowe in deede that this is very Christ?
{7:27} Howbeit, we know this man whence he is: but when Christe cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
{7:28} Then cryed Iesus in the temple, as he taught, saying: Ye both knowe me, and whence I am, ye knowe. And I am not come of my selfe: but he that set me is true, whom ye knowe not.
{7:29} But I knowe him, for I am of him, and he hath sent me.
{7:30} Then they sought to take hym: but no man layde handes on hym, because his houre was not yet come.
{7:31} Many of the people beleued on hym, and saide: When Christe commeth, wyl he do mo miracles then these that this man hath done?
{7:32} The pharisees hearde, that the people murmured such thinges concerning hym: And the pharisees and the hye priestes sent seruauntes to take hym.
{7:33} Then sayde Iesus vnto them: yet am I a litle whyle with you, and then go I vnto hym that sent me.
{7:34} Ye shall seke me, & shall not fynde me: & where I am thither can ye not come.
{7:35} Then sayde the Iewes among them selues: Whyther wyll he go, that we shall not fynde hym? Wyll he go vnto the dispearsed among the Gretians, & teache the gentiles?
{7:36} What maner of saying is this that he sayde, ye shall seke me, and shall not fynde me: and where I am, thyther can ye not come?
{7:37} In the last day, that great day of the feast, Iesus stoode and cryed, saying: Yf any man thirste, let him come vnto me and drynke:
{7:38} He that beleueth on me, as saith the scripture, out of his belly shall flowe ryuers of water of lyfe.
{7:39} (But this spake he of the spirite, which they yt beleue on hym, should receaue. For the holy ghost was not yet there because Iesus was not yet glorified.)
{7:40} Many of the people therfore, when they hearde this saying, sayde: Of a trueth this is the prophete.
{7:41} But other sayde, this is Christe: But some saide, shall Christe come out of Galilee?
{7:42} Sayth not the scripture, that Christe shall come of the seede of Dauid, and out of the towne of Bethlehem, where Dauid was?
{7:43} So was there discention among the people, because of hym.
{7:44} And some of them woulde haue taken hym, but no man layde handes on him.
{7:45} Then came the seruauntes to the hye priestes & pharisees: and they sayde vnto them, why haue ye not brought him?
{7:46} The seruauntes aunswered: Neuer man spake as this man doeth.
{7:47} Then aunswered them the pharisees: Are ye also deceaued?
{7:48} Doth any of the rulers or of the pharisees beleue on hym?
{7:49} But this common people which know not the lawe, are cursed.
{7:50} Nicodemus sayth vnto the, he that came to Iesus by nyght, and was one of them:
{7:51} Doth our lawe iudge any man, before it heare hym, and knowe what he hath done?
{7:52} They aunswered, and saide vnto him: Art thou also of Galilee? Search & loke: For out of Galilee aryseth no prophete.
{7:53} And euery man went vnto his owne house.
{8:1} Iesus went vnto mout Oliuete.
{8:2} And early in the mornyng he came agayne into the temple, and all the people came vnto hym, & he sate downe and taught them.
{8:3} And the scribes and pharisees brought vnto hym a woman taken in adulterie, & when they had set her in the middes,
{8:4} They sayde vnto hym: Maister, this woman was taken in adulterie, euen as the deede was a doyng.
{8:5} Moyses in the lawe commaunded vs that suche shoulde be stoned: But what sayest thou?
{8:6} This they sayde to tempte hym, that they myght accuse hym. But Iesus stowped downe, and with his fynger wrote on the grounde.
{8:7} So, when they continued asking him, he lyft vp hym selfe, & sayde vnto them: Let hym that is among you without sinne, caste the first stone at her.
{8:8} And agayne he stowped downe, and wrote on the grounde.
{8:9} And when they hearde this, beyng accused of their owne consciences, they went out one by one, begynnyng at the eldest, euen vnto the last: and Iesus was left alone, & the woman standyng in the myddes.
{8:10} When Iesus had lyft vp hym selfe, & sawe no man but the woman, he sayde vnto her: Woma where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condempned thee?
{8:11} She sayde, No man Lorde. And Iesus sayde, Neither do I condempne thee: Go, and sinne no more.
{8:12} Then spake Iesus agayne vnto them, saying, I am the light of ye world: He that foloweth me, doth not walke in darknesse, but shal haue the light of life.
{8:13} The pharisees therfore said vnto him: Thou bearest recorde of thy selfe, thy recorde is not true.
{8:14} Iesus aunswered, & saide vnto them: Though I beare recorde of my selfe, yet my recorde is true. For I knowe whence I came, & whyther I go: But ye can not tel whence I come, and whyther I go.
{8:15} Ye iudge after the fleshe, I iudge no man.
{8:16} And if I iudge, my iudgement is true: For I am not alone, but I and the father that sent me.
{8:17} It is also written in your lawe, that the testimonie of two men is true.
{8:18} I am one that beareth witnesse of my selfe, & the father that sent me beareth witnesse of me.
{8:19} Then sayde they vnto hym: Where is thy father? Iesus aunswered, Ye neither knowe me, nor yet my father: Yf ye had knowen me, ye should haue knowen my father also.
{8:20} These wordes spake Iesus in ye treasurie, as he taught in the temple, and no man layde handes on hym, for his houre was not yet come.
{8:21} Then sayde Iesus againe vnto them: I go my way, and ye shall seeke me, and shall dye in your synnes: Whyther I go, thyther can ye not come.
{8:22} Then sayde the Iewes: Wyll he kyll hym selfe, because he saith, whyther I go, thyther can ye not come?
{8:23} And he sayde vnto them: ye are from beneathe, I am from aboue: ye are of this worlde, I am not of this worlde.
{8:24} I sayde therefore vnto you, that you shall dye in your sinnes. For yf ye beleue not that I am he, ye shall dye in your sinnes.
{8:25} Then sayde they vnto hym: Who art thou? And Iesus saith vnto them: Euen the very same thyng that I sayde vnto you from the begynnyng.
{8:26} I haue many thynges to saye, and to iudge of you. Yea, & he that sent me, is true: And I speake to the world, those thynges which I haue hearde of hym.
{8:27} Howebeit, they vnderstoode not that he spake to them of his father.
{8:28} Then saide Iesus vnto them: When ye haue lift vp an hye the sonne of man, then shall ye knowe that I am he, and that I do nothyng of my selfe: but as my father hath taught me, euen so I speake these thynges.
{8:29} And he that sent me, is with me. The father hath not left me alone: For I do alwayes those thynges that please him.
{8:30} As he spake those wordes, many beleued on hym.
{8:31} Then sayde Iesus to those Iewes which beleued on him: Yf ye continue in my word, then are ye my very disciples.
{8:32} And ye shall knowe the trueth, and the trueth shall make you free.
{8:33} They aunswered hym: We be Abrahams seede, and were neuer bonde to any man: howe sayest thou then, ye shalbe made free?
{8:34} Iesus aunswered them: Ueryly, veryly I say vnto you, that whosoeuer comitteth sinne, is the seruaunt of sinne.
{8:35} And the seruaut abideth not in ye house for euer: but the sonne abydeth euer.
{8:36} Yf the sonne therefore shall make you free, then are ye free in deede.
{8:37} I know that ye are Abrahams seede, but ye seke meanes to kyll me, because my worde hath no place in you.
{8:38} I speake that whiche I haue seene with my father: and ye do that whiche ye haue seene with your father.
{8:39} They aunswered, and saide vnto him: Abraham is our father. Iesus saith vnto them: Yf ye were Abrahams childre, ye woulde do the workes of Abraham.
{8:40} But now ye go about to kyll me, a ma that hath tolde you the trueth, which I haue heard of god: this did not Abraha.
{8:41} Ye do the deedes of your father. Then said they to him: We be not borne of fornication, we haue one father, euen God.
{8:42} Iesus saide vnto them: Yf God were your father, truely ye woulde loue me: For I proceaded foorth, and came from God: neither came I of my selfe, but he sent me.
{8:43} Why do ye not knowe my speache? euen because ye cannot heare my word.
{8:44} Ye are of your father the deuyll, and the lustes of your father wyll ye do. He was a murtherer from the begynnyng, and abode not in the trueth: because there is no trueth in hym. When he speaketh a lye, he speaketh of his owne: For he is a lyer, and the father of the same thyng.
{8:45} And because I tel you the trueth, therfore ye beleue me not.
{8:46} Which of you rebuketh me of sinne? Yf I say the trueth, why do not ye beleue me?
{8:47} He that is of god, heareth gods wordes. Ye therfore heare the not, because ye are not of God.
{8:48} Then aunswered the Iewes, & saide vnto hym: Say we not well that thou art a Samaritane, and hast the deuyl?
{8:49} Iesus aunswered, I haue not the deuyll: but I honour my father, and ye haue dishonoured me.
{8:50} I seke not myne owne praise, there is one that seketh, and iudgeth.
{8:51} Ueryly veryly I saye vnto you, yf a man kepe my saying, he shall neuer see death.
{8:52} Then sayde the Iewes vnto hym: Now know we that thou hast ye deuyll. Abraham is dead, & the prophetes: and thou sayest, yf a man kepe my saying, he shall neuer taste of death.
{8:53} Art thou greater the our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophetes are dead: whom makest thou thy selfe?
{8:54} Iesus aunswered: Yf I honour my selfe, mine honour is nothing. It is my father that honoureth me, which ye say is your God:
{8:55} And yet ye haue not knowen him, but I knowe hym: And if I say I knowe hym not, I shalbe a lyer lyke vnto you. But I knowe hym, & kepe his saying.
{8:56} Your father Abraham was glad to see my day: and he saw it, and reioyced.
{8:57} Then sayde the Iewes vnto hym: Thou art not yet fiftie yeres olde, & hast thou seene Abraham.
{8:58} Iesus sayde vnto them: Ueryly, veryly I saye vnto you, before Abraham was, I am.
{8:59} Then toke they vp stones to caste at hym: but Iesus hyd hym selfe, and went out of the temple.
{9:1} And as Iesus passed by, he saw a man whiche was blynde fro his birth:
{9:2} And his disciples asked hym, saying: Maister, who did sinne, this man, or his father and mother, that he was borne blynde?
{9:3} Iesus aunswered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor yet his father & mother: but that the workes of God shoulde be shewed in hym.
{9:4} I must worke the workes of him that sent me, whyle it is daye. The nyght commeth when no man can worke.
{9:5} As long as I am in the world, I am the lyght of the worlde.
{9:6} Assoone as he had thus spoke, he spat on the grounde, and made claye of the spittle, and he annoynted with the claye the eyes of the blynde,
{9:7} And sayde vnto hym: Go, washe thee in the poole of Siloe, whiche by interpretation, is as much to say, as sent. He went his way therefore, & washed, and came agayne, seyng.
{9:8} So, the neyghbours, and they that hadde seene hym before when he was blynde, sayde: Is not this he that sate and begged?
{9:9} Some sayde, this is he: Other sayde, he is lyke hym. He hym selfe sayde, I am euen he.
{9:10} Therfore sayde they vnto him: Howe are thyne eyes opened?
{9:11} He aunswered and sayde: The man that is called Iesus made claye, and annoynted myne eyes, and sayde vnto me, go to the poole Siloe and washe: And when I went and washed, I receaued my syght.
{9:12} Then sayde they vnto hym, where is he? He sayde, I can not tell.
{9:13} They brought to the pharisees, hym that a litle before was blynde.
{9:14} And it was the Sabboth day when Iesus made ye claye, & opened his eyes.
{9:15} Then againe the pharisees also asked hym, howe he had receaued his syght. He sayde vnto them: He put claye vpon myne eyes, and I washed, and do see.
{9:16} Therfore sayde some of the pharisees, this man is not of God, because he kepeth not the Sabboth day. Other said: How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a stryfe among them.
{9:17} They spake vnto the blynde man againe: What sayest thou of him, because he hath opened thyne eyes? He sayde, he is a prophete.
{9:18} But the Iewes dyd not beleue the man, howe that he had ben blynde, and receaued his syght, vntyll they called the father and mother of hym that had receaued his syght:
{9:19} And they asked them, saying: Is this your sonne, whom ye saye was borne blynde? Howe doeth he nowe see then?
{9:20} His father & mother aunswered them, and sayde: We knowe that this is our sonne, and that he was borne blynde:
{9:21} But by what meanes he now seeth, we can not tell: Or who hath opened his eyes, can not we tell. He is olde inough, aske him, let him aunswere for himselfe.
{9:22} Such wordes spake his father & mother, because they feared the Iewes: For the Iewes had decreed alredy, that yf any man dyd confesse that he was Christe, he shoulde be excommunicate out of the synagogue.
{9:23} Therfore sayde his father & mother: he is olde inough, aske hym.
{9:24} Then agayne called they the man that was blynde, and sayde vnto hym: Geue God the prayse, we knowe that this man is a sinner.
{9:25} He aunswered, and sayde: Whether he be a sinner or no, I can not tell: One thyng I am sure of, that wheras I was blynde, nowe I see.
{9:26} Then sayde they to hym agayne: What dyd he to thee? Howe opened he thyne eyes?
{9:27} He aunswered them: I tolde you yer whyle, and ye dyd not heare. Wherfore woulde ye heare it agayne? Wyll ye also be his disciples?
{9:28} Then rayted they hym, and sayde, Be thou his disciple: We are Moyses disciples.
{9:29} We are sure, that God spake vnto Moyses: As for this felowe, we knowe not from whence he is.
{9:30} The man aunswered, and sayde vnto them: this is a marueylous thyng, that ye wote not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened myne eyes.
{9:31} For we be sure, that God heareth not sinners: But yf any man be a worshipper of God, and obedient vnto his wyll, hym heareth he.
{9:32} Sence the worlde began, was it not hearde, that any man opened the eyes of one that was borne blynde.
{9:33} If this man were not of God, he coulde haue done nothyng.
{9:34} They aunswered, & sayde vnto hym: Thou art altogether borne in sinne, and doest thou teache vs? And they cast hym out.
{9:35} Iesus hearde that they had excommunicate hym, & when he had founde hym, he sayde vnto hym: Doest thou beleue on the sonne of God?
{9:36} He aunswered and sayde: Who is he Lorde, that I myght beleue on hym?
{9:37} And Iesus sayde vnto hym: Thou hast both seene hym, and it is he that talketh with thee.
{9:38} And he sayde, Lorde, I beleue: And he worshipped hym.
{9:39} And Iesus sayde vnto hym: I am come vnto iudgement into this worlde, that they which see not, myght see: and that they which see, myght be made blynde.
{9:40} And some of the pharisees which were with hym, hearde these wordes, & sayde vnto hym: Are we blynde also?
{9:41} Iesus sayde vnto them, Yf ye were blynde, ye shoulde haue no sinne: But nowe ye say, we see, therfore your sinne remayneth.
{10:1} Veryly, veryly, I say vnto you: He that entreth not in by ye doore into the sheepfolde, but clymeth vp some other way, the same is a thiefe, and a robber.
{10:2} But he that entreth in by the doore, is the sheephearde of the sheepe.
{10:3} To hym the porter openeth, and the sheepe heare his voyce, and he calleth his owne sheepe by name, and leadeth them out.
{10:4} And when he hath sent foorth his owne sheepe, he goeth before them, and the sheepe folowe hym: for they knowe his voyce.
{10:5} A straunger wyll they not folowe, but wyll flee from hym: for they knowe not the voyce of straungers.
{10:6} This prouerbe spake Iesus vnto them: But they vnderstoode not what thynges they were, which he spake vnto them.
{10:7} Then sayde Iesus vnto them againe. Ueryly, veryly, I say vnto you: I am the doore of the sheepe.
{10:8} All, euen as many as came before me, are thieues and robbers: but the sheepe dyd not heare them.
{10:9} I am the doore: by me yf any man enter in, he shalbe safe, and shall go in and out, and fynde pasture.
{10:10} A thiefe commeth not, but for to steale, kyll, & to destroy: I am come, that they myght haue lyfe, and that they myght haue it more aboundauntly.
{10:11} I am the good sheephearde. A good sheephearde, geueth his lyfe for the sheepe.
{10:12} An hyrelyng, and he which is not the sheephearde, neither the sheepe are his owne, seeth the wolfe commyng, and leaueth the sheepe, and fleeth, and the wolfe catcheth, & scattereth the sheepe.
{10:13} The hyrelyng fleeth, because he is an hyrelyng, and careth not for the sheepe.
{10:14} I am the good sheepheard, & knowe my sheepe, and am knowen of myne.
{10:15} As the father knoweth me, euen so, knowe I also the father: And I geue my lyfe for the sheepe.
{10:16} And other sheepe I haue, which are not of this folde: them also must I bryng, & they shall heare my voyce, and there shalbe one folde, and one sheepehearde.
{10:17} Therfore doth my father loue me, because I put my lyfe from me, that I myght take it agayne.
{10:18} No man taketh it from me: but I put it away of my selfe. I haue power to put it from me, and I haue power to take it agayne. This commaundement haue I receaued of my father.
{10:19} There was a discention therefore agayne among the Iewes, for these sayinges.
{10:20} And many of them sayde: He hath the deuyll, & is mad, why heare ye him?
{10:21} Other sayd: These are not ye wordes of hym that hath the deuyll. Can the deuyll open the eyes of the blynde?
{10:22} And it was at Hierusalem, the feast of the dedication, and it was wynter.
{10:23} And Iesus walked in the temple, euen in Solomons porche.
{10:24} Then came the Iewes rounde about hym, and sayde vnto hym: Howe long doest thou make vs doubt? Yf thou be Christe, tell vs playnely.
{10:25} Iesus aunswered them: I tolde you, and ye beleue not. The workes that I do in my fathers name, they beare witnesse of me.
{10:26} But ye beleue not, because ye are not of my sheepe, as I sayde vnto you.
{10:27} My sheepe heare my voyce, and I knowe them, and they folowe me:
{10:28} And I geue vnto them eternall lyfe, and they shal neuer perishe, neither shal any man plucke them out of my hande.
{10:29} My father which gaue them me, is greater then all: and no man is able to take them out of my fathers hande.
{10:30} I and my father are one.
{10:31} Then the Iewes agayne toke vp stones, to stone hym withall.
{10:32} Iesus aunswered them, Many good workes haue I shewed you from my father: for which of the do ye stone me?
{10:33} The Iewes aunswered hym, saying: For thy good workes sake we stone thee not, but for thy blasphemie, and because that thou beyng a man, makest thy selfe God.
{10:34} Iesus aunswered them: Is it not written in your lawe, I sayde, ye are Gods?
{10:35} If he called them Gods, vnto whom the worde of God was spoken, and the scripture can not be broken:
{10:36} Say ye of hym whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the worlde, thou blasphemest, because I saide I am the sonne of God?
{10:37} Yf I do not the workes of my father, beleue me not:
{10:38} But yf I do, and yf ye beleue not me, beleue the workes: that ye may knowe and beleue, that the father is in me, and I in hym.
{10:39} Agayne they went about to take hym: and he escaped out of their hande,
{10:40} And went away againe beyonde Iordane, into the place where Iohn before had baptized, and there he abode.
{10:41} And many resorted vnto hym, and sayde: Iohn dyd no miracle, but all thynges that Iohn spake of this man were true.
{10:42} And many beleued on hym there.
{11:1} A certayne man was sicke, named Lazarus of Bethanie, the towne of Marie and her sister Martha.
{11:2} (It was that Marie which anoynted ye Lorde with oyntment, and wyped his feete with her heere, whose brother Lazarus was sicke.)
{11:3} Therfore, his sisters sent vnto hym, saying: Lorde, beholde, he whom thou louest is sicke.
{11:4} When Iesus hearde that, he sayde, this infirmitie is not vnto death: but for the glory of God, that the sonne of God, myght be glorified therby.
{11:5} Iesus loued Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
{11:6} When he had hearde therfore that he was sicke, he abode two dayes styll in the same place where he was.
{11:7} Then after that, sayde he to his disciples: Let vs go into Iurie agayne.
{11:8} His disciples sayde vnto hym: Maister, the Iewes lately sought to stone thee, and wylt thou go thither agayne?
{11:9} Iesus aunswered: Are there not twelue houres of the day? If any man walke in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the lyght of this worlde.
{11:10} But yf a man walke in the nyght, he stumbleth, because there is no lyght in hym.
{11:11} These thynges sayde he, and after that, he sayde vnto them: Our friende Lazarus slepeth, but I go to wake hym out of slepe.
{11:12} Then sayde his disciples: Lorde, yf he slepe, he shall do well inough.
{11:13} Howbeit, Iesus spake of his death, but they thought that he had spoken of the naturall slepe.
{11:14} Then sayde Iesus vnto the playnely, Lazarus is dead:
{11:15} And I am glad for your sakes, that I was not there, because ye may beleue. Neuerthelesse, let vs go vnto hym.
{11:16} Then sayde Thomas, which is called Didimus, vnto his felowe disciples: let vs also go, that we may dye with hym.
{11:17} Then went Iesus, and founde that he had lyen in his graue, foure dayes alredy.
{11:18} (Bethanie was nye vnto Hierusalem, about fifteene furlonges of.)
{11:19} And many of the Iewes came to Martha and Marie to comfort them ouer their brother.
{11:20} Martha assoone as she hearde that Iesus was commyng, went and met hym: but Marie sate styll in the house.
{11:21} Then sayde Martha vnto Iesus: Lorde, yf thou haddest ben here, my brother had not dyed:
{11:22} Neuerthelesse, nowe I knowe that whatsoeuer thou askest of God, God wyll geue it thee.
{11:23} Iesus sayth vnto her: Thy brother shall ryse agayne.
{11:24} Martha sayth vnto hym: I knowe that he shall ryse agayne in the resurrection at the last day.
{11:25} Iesus sayth vnto her, I am the resurrection, and the lyfe: He that beleueth on me, yea, though he were dead, yet shall he lyue.
{11:26} And whosoeuer lyueth, and beleueth on me, shall neuer dye. Beleuest thou this?
{11:27} She sayde vnto hym: Yea Lorde, I beleue that thou art Christe the sonne of God, which shoulde come into the worlde.
{11:28} And assoone as she had so sayde, she went her way, and called Marie her sister secretely, saying: The Maister is come, and calleth for thee.
{11:29} Assoone as she hearde that, she arose quickly, and came vnto hym.
{11:30} Iesus was not yet come into the towne: but was in that place where Martha met hym.
{11:31} The Iewes then which were with her in the house & comforted her, when they sawe Marie that she rose vp hastelye, and went out, folowed her, saying: She goeth vnto the graue, to weepe there.
{11:32} Then when Marie was come where Iesus was, and sawe hym, she fell downe at his feete, and sayth vnto him: Lorde, yf thou haddest ben here, my brother had not ben dead.
{11:33} Whe Iesus therfore sawe her weepe, and the Iewes also weepyng which came with her, he groned in the spirite, and was troubled in hym selfe.
{11:34} And sayde: Where haue ye layde him? They sayde vnto hym: Lorde, come, and see.
{11:35} And Iesus wept.
{11:36} Then sayde the Iewes: Beholde howe he loued hym.
{11:37} And some of them sayde: Coulde not he which opened the eyes of the blinde, haue made also, that this man shoulde not haue dyed?
{11:38} Iesus therfore agayne groned in him selfe, and came to the graue. It was a caue, and a stone layde on it.
{11:39} Iesus sayde: Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of hym that was dead, sayde vnto hym, Lorde, by this tyme he stinketh: For he hath ben dead foure dayes.
{11:40} Iesus sayde vnto her: Sayde I not vnto thee, that yf thou dyddest beleue, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
{11:41} Then they toke away the stone from the place where the dead was layde. And Iesus lyft vp his eyes, and sayde: Father, I thanke thee that thou hast hearde me.
{11:42} Howbeit, I knowe, that thou hearest me alwayes: but because of the people which stande by, I sayde it, that they maye beleue that thou hast sent me.
{11:43} And when he thus had spoken, he cryed with a loude voyce: Lazarus, come foorth.
{11:44} And he that was dead, came foorth, bounde hande and foote, with graue clothes, and his face was bounde with a napkyn. Iesus sayde vnto them: loose hym, and let hym go.
{11:45} Then many of the Iewes which came to Marie, and had seene ye thynges which Iesus dyd, beleued on hym.
{11:46} But some of them went their wayes to the pharisees, and tolde them what Iesus had done.
{11:47} Then gathered the hye priestes and the pharisees a councell, and sayde: What do we? For this man doth many miracles.
{11:48} If we let hym scape thus, all men wyll beleue on him, and the Romaynes shall come, and take away both our rowme and the people.
{11:49} And one of them named Caiaphas, beyng the hye priest that same yere, sayde vnto them: Ye perceaue nothyng at all,
{11:50} Nor consider, that it is expedient for vs, that one man dye for the people, and not that all the people perishe.
{11:51} This spake he, not of hym selfe, but beyng hye priest that same yere, he prophesied that Iesus shoulde dye for the people,
{11:52} And not for the people only: but that he shoulde gather together in one, the chyldren of God, that were scattered abrode.
{11:53} Then from that day foorth, they toke councell together, for to put hym to death.
{11:54} Iesus therfore walked no more openlye among the Iewes: but went his way thence, vnto a countrey nye to a wildernesse, into a citie which is called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
{11:55} And the Iewes Easter was nye at hande, and many went out of the countrey vp to Hierusale before the Easter, to purifie them selues.
{11:56} Then sought they for Iesus, & spake among them selues, as they stoode in the temple: What thynke ye, seeyng he commeth not to the feast day?
{11:57} The hye priestes and pharisees had geuen a commaundement, that yf any man knewe where he were, he shoulde shewe it, that they myght take hym.
{12:1} Then Iesus, sixe dayes before the Passouer, came to Bethanie, where Lazarus had ben dead, whom he raysed from death.
{12:2} There they made hym a supper, and Martha serued: but Lazarus was one of them that sate at the table with hym.
{12:3} Then toke Marie a pounde of oyntment of Spike narde, very costly, and annoynted Iesus feete, and wyped his feete with her heere: and the house was fylled with the odoure of the oyntment.
{12:4} Then sayde one of his disciples, euen Iudas Iscariot Simons sonne, which shoulde betraye hym.
{12:5} Why was not this oyntment solde for three hundred pence, and geuen to the poore?
{12:6} This he sayde, not that he cared for the poore: but because he was a thiefe, and had the bagge, and bare that which was geuen.
{12:7} Then sayde Iesus: Let her alone, agaynst the day of my burying hath she kept this.
{12:8} For the poore alwayes shall ye haue with you: but me haue ye not alwayes.
{12:9} Much people of the Iewes therfore had knowledge that he was there. And they came not for Iesus sake only: but that they might se Lazarus also, who he raysed from death.
{12:10} But the hye priestes helde a councell, that they myght put Lazarus to death also,
{12:11} Because that for his sake, many of the Iewes went away, and beleued on Iesus.
{12:12} On the next day, much people that were come to ye feast, when they hearde that Iesus should come to Hierusalem,
{12:13} Toke braunches of paulme trees, and went foorth to meete hym, and cryed: Hosanna, blessed is he that in the name of the Lorde commeth, kyng of Israel.
{12:14} And Iesus got a young Asse, and sate theron, as it is written:
{12:15} Feare not daughter of Sion, beholde, thy kyng commeth, sittyng on an Asses colte.
{12:16} These thynges vnderstoode not his disciples at the first: but when Iesus was glorified, the remembred they that such thinges were written of him, & that such thynges they had done vnto hym.
{12:17} The people that was with him, when he called Lazarus out of his graue, and raysed hym from death, bare recorde.
{12:18} Therfore met hym the people also, because they hearde that he had done such a miracle.
{12:19} The pharisees therfore sayde among them selues: perceaue ye, howe ye preuayle nothyng? Beholde, all the whole worlde goeth after hym.
{12:20} There were certaine Grekes among them, that came to worship at the feast:
{12:21} The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida, a citie of Galilee, and desired hym, saying: Syr, we woulde fayne see Iesus.
{12:22} Philip came and tolde Andrewe: And agayne, Andrewe & Philip tolde Iesus.
{12:23} And Iesus aunswered them, saying: The houre is come, that the sonne of man must be glorified.
{12:24} Ueryly, veryly, I say vnto you, except the wheate corne fall into the grounde, and dye, it abideth alone: If it dye, it bryngeth foorth much fruite.
{12:25} He that loueth his lyfe, shall destroy it: and he that hateth his lyfe in this worlde, shall kepe it vnto lyfe eternall.
{12:26} If any man minister vnto me, let hym folowe me: And where I am, there shall also my minister be. If any man minister vnto me, hym wyll my father honour.
{12:27} Nowe is my soule troubled, and what shall I say? Father, saue me from this houre: but therfore came I into this houre.
{12:28} Father, glorifie thy name. Then came there a voyce from heauen saying I haue both glorified it, and wyll glorifie it agayne.
{12:29} The people therfore that stoode by and hearde it, sayde that it thundred: Other sayde, an Angel spake to hym.
{12:30} Iesus aunswered and sayde: This voyce came, not because of me, but for your sakes.
{12:31} Nowe is the iudgement of this worlde: Nowe shall the prince of this worlde be cast out.
{12:32} And I, yf I were lyft vp from the earth, wyll drawe all men vnto me.
{12:33} (This he sayde, signifiyng what death he shoulde dye.)
{12:34} The people aunswered him: We haue hearde out of the lawe, that Christe bydeth euer: and howe sayest thou, the sonne of man must be lyft vp? Who is that sonne of man?
{12:35} Then Iesus sayde vnto them: Yet a litle while is the light with you. Walke while ye haue light, lest the darknesse come on you: For he that walketh in the darke, wotteth not whither he goeth.
{12:36} Whyle ye haue lyght, beleue on the lyght, that ye may be the chyldren of the lyght. These thynges spake Iesus, and departed, & hyd hym selfe from the.
{12:37} But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet beleued not they on hym,
{12:38} That the saying of Esaias the prophete myght be fulfylled, which he spake: Lorde, who shall beleue our saying? And to whom is the arme of the Lorde declared?
{12:39} Therfore coulde they not beleue, because that Esaias sayth agayne:
{12:40} He hath blynded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they shoulde not see with their eyes, & lest they should vnderstande with their hearte, & should be conuerted, and I should heale them.
{12:41} Such thynges sayde Esaias, when he sawe his glory, and spake of hym.
{12:42} Neuerthelesse, among ye chiefe rulers also, many beleued on hym: But because of the pharisees, they dyd not confesse hym, lest they should be excomunicate.
{12:43} For they loued the prayse of men, more then the prayse of God.
{12:44} Iesus cryed, and sayde: He that beleueth on me, beleueth not on me, but on hym that sent me.
{12:45} And he that seeth me, seeth hym that sent me.
{12:46} I am come a lyght into ye worlde, that whosoeuer beleueth on me, should not byde in darknesse.
{12:47} And yf any man heare my wordes, and beleue not, I iudge hym not: For I came not to iudge the worlde, but to saue the worlde.
{12:48} He that refuseth me, & receaueth not my wordes, hath one that iudgeth him: The worde that I haue spoken, the same shall iudge hym in the last day.
{12:49} For I haue not spoken of my selfe: but the father which sent me, he gaue me a commaundement what I should say, and what I shoulde speake.
{12:50} And I knowe that his commaundement is lyfe euerlastyng. Whatsoeuer I speake therfore, euen as the father bad me, so I speake.
{13:1} Before the feast of the Passouer, when Iesus knewe that his houre was come, yt he shoulde departe out of this world vnto the father: When he loued his which were in the world, vnto the ende he loued them.
{13:2} And when supper was ended (after that the deuyll had put in the heart of Iudas Iscariot Simons sonne, to betray hym)
{13:3} Iesus knowyng that the father had geuen all thynges into his handes, and that he was come from God, and went to God:
{13:4} He rose from supper, and layde asyde his vpper garmentes: And when he had taken a towel, he gyrded hym selfe.
{13:5} After that, he powred water into a bason, and began to washe the disciples feete, and to wype them with the towel wherwith he was gyrded.
{13:6} Then came he to Simon Peter. And Peter sayde vnto hym: Lorde, doest thou wasshe my feete?
{13:7} Iesus aunswered, & sayde vnto hym: What I do, thou wotest not nowe, but thou shalt knowe hereafter.
{13:8} Peter sayth vnto hym: Thou shalt neuer wasshe my feete. Iesus aunswered hym: If I wasshe thee not, thou hast no part with me.
{13:9} Simon Peter sayth vnto him: Lorde, not my feete only, but also the handes, and the head.
{13:10} Iesus sayth to hym: He that is wasshed, nedeth not saue to washe his feete, but is cleane euery whit. And ye are cleane, but not all.
{13:11} For he knewe who it was that should betray hym. Therfore sayde he: ye are not all cleane.
{13:12} So, after he had wasshed their feete, and receaued his clothes, and was set downe agayne, he sayde vnto them: Wote ye what I haue done to you?
{13:13} Ye call me Maister, and Lorde, and ye say well, for so am I.
{13:14} If I then your Lorde and Maister, haue wasshed your feete, ye also ought to wasshe one anothers feete.
{13:15} For I haue geuen you an ensample, that ye shoulde do as I haue done to you.
{13:16} Ueryly, veryly, I say vnto you: The seruaunt is not greater the his maister, neither the messenger greater then he that sent hym.
{13:17} Yf ye knowe these thynges, happy are ye, yf ye do them.
{13:18} I speake not of you all. I knowe whom I haue chosen. But that the scripture may be fulfylled: He that eateth bread with me, hath lyft vp his heele agaynst me.
{13:19} Nowe tell I you before it come: that when it is come to passe, ye myght beleue that I am he.
{13:20} Ueryly, veryly, I say vnto you, he that receaueth whomsoeuer I sende, receaueth me: And he that receaueth me, receaueth hym that sent me.
{13:21} When Iesus had thus sayde, he was troubled in spirite, and testified, & saide: Ueryly, veryly, I say vnto you, that one of you shall betray me.
{13:22} Then the disciples loked one on another, doubtyng of whom he spake.
{13:23} There was one of Iesus disciples, leanyng on Iesus bosome, euen he whom Iesus loued.
{13:24} To hym beckened Simon Peter therfore, that he shoulde aske who it was of whom he spake.
{13:25} He then, when he leaned on Iesus brest, sayde vnto hym: Lorde, who is it?
{13:26} Iesus aunswered: He it is to whom I geue a sop when I haue dipped it. And he wet the sop, and gaue it to Iudas Iscariot, Simons sonne.
{13:27} And after the sop, Satan entred into hym. Then sayde Iesus vnto hym: That thou doest, do quickly.
{13:28} That wiste no man at the table, for what intent he spake vnto hym.
{13:29} Some of the thought, because Iudas had the bagge, that Iesus had sayde vnto hym, bye those thynges that we haue neede of agaynst the feast: or, that he shoulde geue somethyng to ye poore.
{13:30} Assoone then, as he had receaued the sop, he went immediatly out: and it was nyght.
{13:31} Therfore, when he was gone out, Iesus sayd, Nowe is the sonne of man glorified: And God is glorified in hym.
{13:32} Yf God be glorified in hym, God shall also glorifie hym in hym selfe, and shall strayghtway glorifie hym.
{13:33} Litle children, yet a litle whyle am I with you. Ye shall seeke me: and as I sayde vnto the Iewes, whither I go, thither can ye not come. Also to you say I nowe:
{13:34} A newe commaundement geue I vnto you, that ye loue together, as I haue loued you, that euen so ye loue one another.
{13:35} By this shall all men knowe that ye are my disciples, yf ye haue loue one to another.
{13:36} Simon Peter saide vnto him: Lorde, whither goest thou? Iesus aunswered hym: Whither I go, thou canst not folowe me nowe, but thou shalt folowe me afterwardes.
{13:37} Peter sayde vnto hym: Lorde, why can not I folowe thee nowe? I wyll ieoparde my lyfe for thy sake.
{13:38} Iesus aunswered hym: Wylt thou ieoparde thy lyfe for my sake? Uerly, veryly, I saye vnto thee, the Cocke shall not crowe, tyll thou haue denyed me thryse.
{14:1} And he sayde vnto his disciples, Let not your hearte be troubled: Ye beleue in god, beleue also in me.
{14:2} In my fathers house, are many dwellyng places: If it were not so, I woulde haue tolde you. I go to prepare a place for you.
{14:3} And yf I go to prepare a place for you, I wyll come agayne, and receaue you, euen vnto my selfe: that where I am, there may ye be also.
{14:4} And whither I go, ye knowe, and the way ye knowe.
{14:5} Thomas sayth vnto hym: Lorde, we knowe not whither thou goest: And howe is it possible for vs to knowe the waye?
{14:6} Iesus sayth vnto hym: I am the way, and the trueth, and the lyfe. No man cometh vnto the father, but by me.
{14:7} If ye had knowen me, ye had knowen my father also. And nowe ye knowe hym, and haue seene hym.
{14:8} Philip sayth vnto hym: Lorde, shewe vs the father, and it suffiseth vs.
{14:9} Iesus sayth vnto hym: Haue I ben so long tyme with you, & yet hast thou not knowen me? Philip, he that hath seene me, hath seene the father. And howe sayest thou then, shewe vs the father?
{14:10} Beleuest thou not, that I am in the father, & the father in me? The wordes that I speake vnto you, I speake not of my selfe: but the father that dwelleth in me, is he that doth the workes.
{14:11} Beleue me, that I am in the father, and the father in me: Or els beleue me for the workes sake.
{14:12} Ueryly, veryly I say vnto you, he that beleueth on me, the workes that I do, the same shal he do also, and greater workes then these shall he do, because I go vnto the father.
{14:13} And whatsoeuer ye aske in my name, that wyll I do, that the father may be glorified in the sonne.
{14:14} If ye shall aske any thing in my name, I wyll do it.
{14:15} If ye loue me, kepe my commaundementes,
{14:16} And I wyll pray the father, and he shall geue you another comforter, that he may byde with you for euer:
{14:17} Euen the spirite of trueth, whom the worlde can not receaue, because the worlde seeth hym not, neither knoweth hym. But ye knowe hym: For he dwelleth with you, and shalbe in you.
{14:18} I wyll not leaue you comfortlesse, but wyll come to you.
{14:19} Yet a litle whyle, and the worlde shall see me no more: but ye shall see me, because I lyue, and ye shall lyue also.
{14:20} That day shall ye knowe, that I am in my father, and you in me, & I in you.
{14:21} He that hath my commaundementes, and kepeth them, the same is he that loueth me: And he that loueth me, shalbe loued of my father, and I wyll loue him, and wyll shew myne owne selfe to hym.
{14:22} Iudas sayth vnto hym, not Iudas Iscariot: Lorde, what is done, that thou wylt shewe thy selfe vnto vs, and not vnto the worlde?
{14:23} Iesus aunswered, & sayde vnto hym: If a man loue me, he wyll kepe my sayinges: and my father wyll loue hym, and we wyll come vnto hym, and dwell with hym.
{14:24} He that loueth me not, kepeth not my sayinges: And the word which ye heare, is not myne, but the fathers which sent me.
{14:25} These thynges haue I spoken vnto you, beyng yet present with you.
{14:26} But the comforter, which is the holy ghost, whom the father wyll sende in my name, he shal teach you all thinges, & bryng all thynges to your remebraunce whatsoeuer I haue sayde vnto you.
{14:27} Peace I leaue with you, my peace I geue vnto you: Not as the worlde geueth, geue I vnto you. Let not your heartes be greeued, neither feare.
{14:28} Ye haue hearde howe I sayde vnto you, I go away, and come agayne vnto you. Yf ye loued me, ye woulde veryly reioyce, because I sayde, I go vnto the father: for the father is greater then I.
{14:29} And nowe haue I shewed you before it come, that when it is come to passe, ye myght beleue.
{14:30} Hereafter wyll I not talke many wordes vnto you: For the prince of this worlde cometh, and hath nought in me.
{14:31} But that the worlde may knowe that I loue the father: And as the father gaue me commaundement, euen so do I. Ryse, let vs go hence.
{15:1} I am the true vine, and my father is the husbandman.
{15:2} Euery braunche that beareth not fruite in me, he will take away: And euery braunche that beareth fruite wyll he pourge, that it may bryng foorth more fruite.
{15:3} Nowe are ye cleane through the worde which I haue spoken vnto you.
{15:4} Byde in me, and I in you. As the braunche can not beare fruite of it selfe, except it byde in the vine: no more can ye, except ye abyde in me.
{15:5} I am the vine, ye are the braunches. He that abydeth in me, and I in hym, the same bryngeth foorth much fruite: For without me can ye do nothyng.
{15:6} Yf a man byde not in me, he is cast foorth as a braunch, and withereth, and men gather them, and cast them into the fyre, and they burne.
{15:7} Yf ye byde in me, and my wordes abyde in you, aske what ye wyll, and it shalbe done for you.
{15:8} Herein is my father glorified: that ye beare much fruite, and become my disciples.
{15:9} As the father hath loued me, euen so haue I loued you: Continue ye in my loue.
{15:10} Yf ye kepe my commaundementes, ye shall abyde in my loue, euen as I haue kept my fathers commaundementes, and abyde in his loue.
{15:11} These thynges haue I spoken vnto you, that my ioy might remayne in you, and that your ioy myght be full.
{15:12} This is my commaundement, that ye loue together, as I haue loued you.
{15:13} Greater loue hath no man, then this: yt a man bestowe his life for his frendes.
{15:14} Ye are my frendes, yf ye do whatsoeuer I commaunde you.
{15:15} Hencefoorth call I you not seruautes: for the seruaunt knoweth not what his Lorde doeth. But you haue I called frendes, for all thynges that I haue hearde of my father, haue I made knowen to you.
{15:16} Ye haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you, and ordayned you, to go, and bryng foorth fruite, and that your fruite shoulde remayne, that whatsoeuer ye aske of the father in my name, he may geue it you.
{15:17} This commaunde I you, that ye loue together.
{15:18} Yf the worlde hate you, ye knowe that it hated me before it hated you.
{15:19} If ye were of the worlde, the worlde would loue his owne: Howbeit, because ye are not of the worlde, but I haue chosen you out of the worlde: therfore the worlde hateth you.
{15:20} Remember the worde that I sayde vnto you: the seruaunt is not greater then the Lorde. If they haue persecuted me, they wyll also persecute you. If they haue kept my saying, they wyll kepe yours also.
{15:21} But all these thynges wyll they do vnto you for my names sake, because they haue not knowe hym that sent me.
{15:22} Yf I had not come and spoken vnto them, they shoulde haue had no sinne: but nowe haue they nothyng to cloke their sinne withall.
{15:23} He that hateth me, hateth my father also.
{15:24} Yf I had not done among them, the workes which none other man dyd, they shoulde haue had no sinne. But nowe haue they both seene, and hated not only me, but also my father,
{15:25} But this commeth to passe, that the worde myght be fulfylled, that is written in their lawe: They hated me without a cause.
{15:26} But when the comforter is come, whom I wyl sende vnto you from the father, euen the spirite of trueth, which proceadeth of the father, he shall testifie of me.
{15:27} And ye shall beare witnesse also, because ye haue ben with me from the begynnyng.
{16:1} These thynges haue I sayde vnto you, because ye shoulde not be offended.
{16:2} They shall excomunitate you: yea the time shall come, that who so euer kylleth you, wyll thynke that he doth God seruice.
{16:3} And such thynges wyll they do vnto you, because they haue not knowen the father, neither yet me.
{16:4} But these thynges haue I tolde you, that when the tyme is come, ye may remeber then that I tolde you. These thynges sayde I not vnto you at the begynnyng, because I was present with you.
{16:5} But nowe I go my waye, to hym that sent me, & none of you asketh me, whyther goest thou.
{16:6} But because I haue saide such thinges vnto you, your heartes are ful of sorow.
{16:7} Neuerthelesse, I tell you the trueth, it is expedient for you that I go away. For yf I go not away, that comforter wyll not come vnto you: But yf I depart, I wyll sende hym vnto you.
{16:8} And whe he is come, he wyll rebuke the world of sinne, and of righteousnes, and of iudgement.
{16:9} Of sinne, because they beleue not on me.
{16:10} Of righteousnes, because I go to my father, and ye shall see me no more.
{16:11} Of iudgement, because the prince of this worlde is iudged alredy.
{16:12} I haue yet many thynges to say vnto you, but ye can not beare them away nowe.
{16:13} Howebeit, when he is come, whiche is the spirite of trueth, he wyl leade you into all trueth. He shall not speake of himselfe: but whatsoeuer he shal heare, that shall he speake, and he wyll shewe you thynges to come.
{16:14} He shall glorifie me: For he shall receaue of mine, and shal shewe vnto you.
{16:15} All thynges that the father hath, are mine: Therfore sayde I vnto you that he shall take of mine, & shew vnto you.
{16:16} After a whyle, and ye shall not see me, and agayne after a whyle ye shall see me: for I go to the father.
{16:17} Then sayde some of his disciples betwene them selues: What is this that he saith vnto vs, after a whyle, & ye shal not see me, and againe, after a whyle ye shal see me: and, that I go to the father?
{16:18} They sayde therefore: What is this that he saith, after a whyle? we can not tell what he saith.
{16:19} Iesus perceaued that they would aske hym, and sayde vnto them: Do ye enquire among your selues of that I said after a whyle, and, ye shall not see me, & againe, after a while & ye shall see me?
{16:20} Ueryly veryly I say vnto you, ye shall wepe and lament, the worlde shall reioyce: ye shall sorowe, but your sorowe shalbe turned to ioy.
{16:21} A woman, when she trauayleth, hath sorowe, because her houre is come: but assoone as she is deliuered of the childe, she remembreth no more the anguishe, for ioy that a man is borne into ye world.
{16:22} And ye nowe therefore haue sorowe: but I wyll see you agayne, and your heartes shall reioyce, and your ioy shall no man take from you.
{16:23} And in that day shall ye aske me no question. Ueryly veryly I say vnto you, whatsoeuer ye shal aske the father in my name, he wyll geue it you.
{16:24} Hytherto haue ye asked nothyng in my name: Aske, & ye shall receaue, that your ioy may be full.
{16:25} These thynges haue I spoken vnto you by prouerbes. The tyme wyl come, when I shall no more speake vnto you by prouerbes: but I shall shewe you playnely of my father.
{16:26} At that day shall ye aske in my name: And I say not vnto you, that I wyll pray vnto my father for you.
{16:27} For the father hym selfe loueth you, because ye haue loued me, and haue beleued that I came out from God.
{16:28} I went out from the father, and came into the worlde: Agayne, I leaue the worlde, and go to the father.
{16:29} His disciples sayde vnto hym: Lo, nowe talkest thou plainely, and speakest no prouerbe.
{16:30} Nowe are we sure that thou knowest all thynges, & nedest not, that any man shoulde aske thee any question: Therfore beleue we, that thou camest from God.
{16:31} Iesus aunswered them: Do ye nowe beleue?
{16:32} Beholde, the houre draweth nye, and is alredy come, that ye shalbe scattered euery man to his owne, and shall leaue me alone. And yet am I not alone: For the father is with me.
{16:33} These wordes haue I spoken vnto you, that in me ye myght haue peace. For in the worlde shall ye haue tribulation: but be of good cheare, I haue ouercome the worlde.
{17:1} These wordes spake Iesus, and lift vp his eyes to heauen, and sayde: Father, the houre is come, glorifie thy sonne that thy sonne also may glorifie thee:
{17:2} As thou hast geuen hym power ouer all fleshe, that he shoulde geue eternall life, to as many as thou hast geuen him.
{17:3} This is lyfe eternall, that they myght knowe thee, the only true God, & Iesus Christe whom thou hast sent.
{17:4} I haue glorified thee on the earth: I haue finished ye worke, which thou gauest me to do.
{17:5} And nowe glorifie thou me, O father, with thine owne selfe, with the glory which I had with thee yer the worlde was.
{17:6} I haue declared thy name vnto ye men, which thou gauest me out of ye world. Thyne they were, and thou gauest the me, and they haue kepte thy worde.
{17:7} Nowe they haue knowen yt al thinges whatsoeuer yu hast geuen me are of thee.
{17:8} For I haue geuen vnto them ye wordes which thou gauest me, and they haue receaued them, and haue knowe surely that I came out from thee, & they haue beleued, that thou dyddest sende me.
{17:9} I pray for them: I pray not for the worlde, but for them which thou hast geuen me, for they are thyne.
{17:10} And all myne are thyne, and thyne are myne, and I am glorified in them.
{17:11} And nowe am I not in the worlde, and they are in the worlde, and I come to thee. Holy father, kepe through thine owne name, the which thou hast geuen me, that they may also be one, as we are.
{17:12} Whyle I was with them in ye worlde, I kept them in thy name. Those that thou gauest me, haue I kept, and none of them is lost, but that lost chylde, that the scripture myght be fulfylled.
{17:13} Nowe come I to thee, and these wordes speake I in the worlde, that they myght haue my ioy fulfylled in them seues.
{17:14} I haue geuen them thy worde, and the worlde hath hated them, because they are not of the worlde, euen as I also am not of the worlde.
{17:15} I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the worlde: but that thou kepe them from euyll.
{17:16} They are not of the worlde, as I also am not of the worlde.
{17:17} Sanctifie them through thy trueth. Thy worde is the trueth.
{17:18} As thou diddest sende me into ye world, eue so haue I also sent the into ye world.
{17:19} And for their sakes sanctifie I my selfe, that they also myght be sanctified through the trueth.
{17:20} Neuerthelesse, I pray not for them alone: but for the also, which shall beleue on me through their preachyng:
{17:21} That they all may be one, as thou father art in me, and I in thee, and that they also may be one in vs: that ye world may beleue, that thou hast sent me.
{17:22} And the glorie which thou gauest me, I haue geuen them, that they may be one, as we also are one.
{17:23} I in them, and thou in me: that they may be made perfecte in one, and that the worlde may knowe that thou hast sent me, and hast loued them, as thou hast loued me.
{17:24} Father, I wyll that they which thou hast geuen me, be with me where I am, that they may see my glorie which thou hast geuen me. For thou louedst me, before the foundation of the world.
{17:25} O ryghteous father, the worlde also hath not knowen thee: But I haue knowen thee, and these haue knowen that thou hast sent me.
{17:26} And I haue declared vnto them thy name, and wyll declare it, that the loue wherewith thou hast loued me, may be in them, and I in them.
{18:1} When Iesus had spoken these wordes, he went forth with his disciples ouer the brooke Cedron, where was a garden, into the whiche he entred, & his disciples.
{18:2} Iudas also whiche betrayed hym, knewe the place? For Iesus oft tymes resorted thyther, with his disciples.
{18:3} Iudas then, after he had receaued a bande of men, and officers of the hye priestes & pharisees, came thyther with lanternes, and torches, and weapons.
{18:4} And Iesus, knowing all thinges that shoulde come on hym, went foorth, and sayde vnto them, whom seke ye?
{18:5} They aunswered him: Iesus of Nazareth. Iesus sayth vnto them, I am he. Iudas also whiche betrayed hym, stoode with them.
{18:6} Assoone then as he sayde vnto them I am he, they went backewarde, & fell to the grounde.
{18:7} Then asked he them agayne, whom seke ye? They said: Iesus of Nazareth.
{18:8} Iesus aunswered, I haue tolde you that I am he: Yf ye seke me therefore, let these go their way.
{18:9} That the saying myght be fulfylled which he spake: Of them which thou gauest me, haue I not lost one.
{18:10} Then Simon Peter, hauing a sword, drewe it, and smote the hye priestes seruaunt, and cut of his ryght eare. The seruauntes name was Malchus.
{18:11} Therefore sayth Iesus vnto Peter, Put vp thy sworde into the sheathe: shall I not drynke of the cuppe whiche my father hath geuen me?
{18:12} Then the companie, and the capitaine, and officers of the Iewes, toke Iesus, and bounde hym,
{18:13} And led hym away to Annas first, (for he was father in lawe vnto Caiaphas,) which was ye hye priest that same yere: And Annas sent Christe bounde vnto Caiaphas the hye priest.
{18:14} Caiaphas was he which gaue councell to the Iewes, that it was expediet that one man should dye for the people.
{18:15} And Simon Peter folowed Iesus, and so did another disciple. That disciple was knowen vnto the hye priest, & went in with Iesus into the palace of the hye priest.
{18:16} But Peter stoode at the doore without. Then went out that other disciple which was knowen vnto the hye priest, and spake vnto the damosell that kept the doore, and brought in Peter.
{18:17} Then saide the damosell, that kept the doore, vnto Peter: Art not thou also one of this mans disciples? He sayde, I am not.
{18:18} The seruauntes and officers stoode there, which had made a fire of coales, (for it was colde) and they warmed the selues. Peter also stoode among them, and warmed hym.
{18:19} The hye priest then asked Iesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.
{18:20} Iesus aunswered him: I spake openly to the worlde, I euer taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whyther all the Iewes resort, & in secrete haue I sayde nothyng.
{18:21} Why askest thou me? Aske the which hearde me, what I haue sayd vnto the: Beholde, they can tell what I sayde.
{18:22} When he had thus spoken, one of the officers whiche stoode by, smote Iesus with a rod saying: Aunswerest thou the hye priest so?
{18:23} Iesus aunswered hym, Yf I haue euyl spoken, beare witnesse of the euyl: But yf I haue well spoken, why smytest thou me?
{18:24} Nowe Annas had sent hym bounde vnto Caiaphas the hye priest.
{18:25} Simon Peter stoode & warmed hym selfe. Then sayde they vnto hym: Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denyed it, and sayde, I am not.
{18:26} One of the seruautes of ye hye priestes, (his cosin whose eare Peter smote of) sayde vnto hym: Dyd not I see thee in the garden with hym?
{18:27} Peter therefore denyed againe: And immediatly the Cocke crewe.
{18:28} Then led they Iesus fro Caiaphas into the hall of iudgement. It was in the mornyng: And they them selues went not into the iudgement hall, leste they shoulde be defyled: but that they myght eate the Passouer.
{18:29} Pilate then went out vnto them, and said: What accusatio bryng you against this man?
{18:30} They aunswered, and said vnto him: Yf he were not an euyll doer, we would not haue deliuered hym vnto thee.
{18:31} Then sayde Pilate vnto them: Take ye him, and iudge him after your owne lawe. The Iewes therfore sayde vnto hym: It is not lawfull for vs to put any man to death.
{18:32} That the wordes of Iesus myght be fulfylled, whiche he spake, signifiyng what death he shoulde dye.
{18:33} Then Pilate entred into the iudgement hall againe, and called Iesus, and sayde vnto hym: Art thou the kyng of the Iewes?
{18:34} Iesus aunswered: Sayest thou that of thy selfe, or did other tell it thee of me?
{18:35} Pilate aunswered: am I a Iewe? Thyne owne nation & hye priestes haue deliuered thee vnto me, what hast thou done?
{18:36} Iesus aunswered: My kyngdome is not of this worlde. Yf my kyngdome were of this worlde, then woulde my seruauntes surely fyght, that I shoulde not be deliuered to the Iewes: but now is my kyngdome not from hence.
{18:37} Pilate therfore sayde vnto hym: Art thou a kyng then? Iesus aunswered: Thou sayest that I am a king. For this cause am I borne, & for this cause came I into the worlde, that I should beare witnesse vnto the trueth: And all that are of the trueth, heare my voyce.
{18:38} Pilate sayde vnto him: What thyng is trueth? And when he had sayde this, he went out agayne vnto the Iewes, & sayth vnto them, I fynde in hym no cause at all.
{18:39} Ye haue a custome, that I shoulde deliuer you one loose at ye Passouer: Wyll ye that I loose vnto you the kyng of the Iewes?
{18:40} Then cryed they all agayne, saying: Not hym, but Barabbas. This Barabbas was a robber.
{19:1} Then Pilate toke Iesus therfore, and scourged hym.
{19:2} And the souldiers wounde a crowne of thornes, and put it on his head: And they did on hym a purple garment,
{19:3} And sayde, Hayle king of the Iewes: And they stroke hym with roddes.
{19:4} Pilate went foorth agayne, and sayde vnto them: Beholde, I bryng hym foorth to you, that ye may knowe that I fynde no fault in hym.
{19:5} Then came Iesus foorth, wearyng a crowne of thorne, and a robe of purple: And he sayth vnto them, beholde the man.
{19:6} When the hye priestes therefore and officers sawe hym, they cryed, saying: crucifie hym, crucifie hym. Pilate sayth vnto them, Take ye hym, and crucifie hym: for I fynde no cause in hym.
{19:7} The Iewes aunswered hym: We haue a lawe, and by our lawe he ought to dye, because he made hym selfe the sonne of God.
{19:8} When Pilate hearde that saying, he was the more afrayde.
{19:9} And went agayne into the iudgement hall, and sayth vnto Iesus, whence art thou? But Iesus gaue hym none aunswere.
{19:10} Then sayde Pilate vnto hym: Speakest thou not vnto me? Knowest thou not that I haue power to crucifie thee, and haue power to loose thee?
{19:11} Iesus aunswered: Thou couldest haue no power at all agaynst me, except it were geuen thee from aboue: Therfore he that deliuered me vnto thee, hath the more sinne.
{19:12} And from thencefoorth sought Pilate meanes to loose hym. But the Iewes cryed, saying: Yf thou let hym go, thou art not Caesers friend. For whosoeuer maketh hym selfe a kyng, speaketh agaynst Caesar.
{19:13} When Pilate hearde that saying, he brought Iesus foorth, & he sate downe in the iudgement seate, in a place that is called the pauement, but in the Hebrue tounge, Gabbatha.
{19:14} It was the preparyng of ye Passouer, and about the sixt houre: And he sayth vnto the Iewes, beholde your kyng.
{19:15} They cryed, away with hym, away with hym, crucifie hym. Pilate sayth vnto them: Shall I crucifie your king? The hye priestes aunswered: We haue no king but Caesar.
{19:16} Then deliuered he hym vnto them, to be crucified. And they toke Iesus, & ledde hym away.
{19:17} And he bare his crosse, & wet forth into a place, which is called ye place of dead mens skulles, but in Hebrue Golgotha:
{19:18} Where they crucified hym, and two other with him, on eyther syde one, and Iesus in the myddes.
{19:19} And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the crosse. The wrytyng was: Iesus of Nazareth, kyng of the Iewes.
{19:20} This title read many of the Iewes: For the place where Iesus was crucified, was nye to ye citie. And it was written in Hebrue, and Greke, and Latine.
{19:21} Then sayde the hye priestes of the Iewes to Pilate, Write not kyng of the Iewes: but, that he sayde, I am kyng of the Iewes.
{19:22} Pilate aunswered: What I haue written, that haue I written.
{19:23} Then the souldiers, when they had crucified Iesus, toke his garmentes, (& made foure partes, to euery souldier a part) and also his coate. The coate was without seame, wouen from the toppe throughout.
{19:24} They sayde therefore among them selues: Let vs not deuide it, but caste lottes for it, who shal haue it. That the scripture myght be fulfylled, saying: They parted my rayment among the, & for my coate dyd they cast lottes. And the souldiers dyd such thynges in deede.
{19:25} There stoode by the crosse of Iesus his mother, and his mothers sister, Marie the wyfe of Cleophas, and Marie Magdalene.
{19:26} Whe Iesus therfore sawe his mother and the disciple standyng by, whom he loued, he saith vnto his mother: Woman, beholde thy sonne.
{19:27} Then sayde he to the disciple, beholde thy mother. And from that houre, the disciple toke her vnto his owne.
{19:28} After these thynges, Iesus knowyng that all thynges were nowe perfourmed, that the scripture might be fulfylled, he sayth, I thirste.
{19:29} So there stoode a vessell by, full of vineger: Therefore they fylled a sponge with vineger, and put it vpon Isope, & put it to his mouth.
{19:30} Assoone as Iesus then receaued of the vineger, he saide, it is finished: and bowed his head, and gaue vp the ghost.
{19:31} The Iewes therefore, because it was the preparyng of the Sabboth that the bodyes should not remaine vpo ye crosse on the Sabboth day (for that Sabboth day, was an hye day) besought Pilate that their legges myght be broken, and that they myght be taken downe.
{19:32} Then came the souldiers, and brake the legges of the first, and of the other which was crucified with hym:
{19:33} But when they came to Iesus, & sawe that he was dead alredye, they brake not his legges.
{19:34} But one of the souldyers with a speare thruste hym into the syde, & foorthwith came there out blood and water.
{19:35} And he that sawe it, bare recorde, and his recorde is true: & he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might beleue also.
{19:36} For these thynges were done, that the scripture shoulde be fulfylled: Ye shall not breake a bone of hym.
{19:37} And agayne another scripture saith: They shall loke on hym whom they pearsed.
{19:38} After this, Ioseph of Aramathia, (which was a disciple of Iesus, but secretely, for feare of ye Iewes) besought Pilate that he myght take downe the body of Iesus. And Pilate gaue hym licence. He came therefore, and toke the dye of Iesus.
{19:39} And there came also Nicodemus (whiche at the begynnyng came to Iesus by nyght) and brought of mirre and aloes myngled together, about an hundred pounde wayght.
{19:40} Then toke they the body of Iesus, & wounde it in linnen clothes, with the odours, as the maner of the Iewes is to burie.
{19:41} And in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a newe sepulchre, wherein was neuer man yet layde.
{19:42} There layde they Iesus therfore, because of the preparyng of the Sabboth of the Iewes: for the sepulchre was nie at hande.
{20:1} The first day of ye Sabbothes, came Marie Magdalene early, whe it was yet darke, vnto the sepulchre, and sawe the stone taken awaye from the graue.
{20:2} Then she ranne, & came to Simo Peter, & to the other disciple who Iesus loued, & saith vnto the: They haue take away the Lorde out of the graue, & we can not tell where they haue layde him.
{20:3} Peter therfore went foorth, and that other disciple, & came to the sepulchre.
{20:4} They ran both together, & the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre:
{20:5} And when he had stowped downe, he sawe the linnen clothes lying, yet went he not in.
{20:6} Then came Simon Peter folowyng hym, and went into the sepulchre, and sawe the lynnen clothes lye,
{20:7} And the napkin yt was about his head not lying with the linnen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by it selfe.
{20:8} Then went in also that other disciple, whiche came first to the sepulchre, and he sawe, and beleued.
{20:9} For as yet they knew not ye scripture, that he should rise agayne from death.
{20:10} Then the disciples wet away agayne vnto their owne house.
{20:11} Marie stoode without at the sepulchre weepyng: So, as she wepte, she bowed her selfe into the sepulchre,
{20:12} And seeth two angels clothed in white, sittyng, the one at the head, & the other at the feete, where the body of Iesus was layde.
{20:13} They saye vnto her: Woman, why weepest thou? She saith vnto the: For they haue taken away my Lorde, & I wote not where they haue layde him.
{20:14} When she had thus sayde, she turned her selfe backe, and sawe Iesus standyng, and knewe not that it was Iesus.
{20:15} Iesus saith vnto her: Woman, why weepest thou? Whom sekest thou? She supposing that he had ben the gardener, saith vnto him: Sir, if thou haue borne him hence, tel me where thou hast layde hym, and I wyll fet hym.
{20:16} Iesus sayth vnto her, Marie. She turned her selfe, and sayde vnto hym: Rabboni, which is to say, Maister.
{20:17} Iesus saith vnto her: Touche me not, for I am not yet ascended to my father: But go to my brethren, and saye vnto them, I ascende vnto my father and your father, and to my God & your God.
{20:18} Marie Magdalene came and tolde the disciples that she had seene ye Lorde, and that he had spoken suche thynges vnto her.
{20:19} The same day at nyght, whiche was the first day of the Sabbothes, when the doores were shut, where the disciples were assembled together for feare of the Iewes, came Iesus and stoode in the myddes, and sayth vnto them, peace be vnto you.
{20:20} And when he had so sayde, he shewed vnto them his handes & his syde. Then were the disciples glad, when they sawe the Lorde.
{20:21} Then sayde Iesus to them agayne, peace be vnto you: As my father sent me, euen so sende I you also.
{20:22} And when he had saide those wordes, he breathed on them, & saith vnto them: Receaue ye the holy ghost.
{20:23} Whosoeuers sinnes ye remit, they are remitted vnto them: And whosoeuers sinnes ye retayne, they are retayned.
{20:24} But Thomas, one of the twelue, which is called Didymus, was not with them when Iesus came.
{20:25} The other disciples therfore sayde vnto hym, we haue seene the Lorde. But he sayde vnto them: Except I see in his handes the print of the nayles, and put my fynger into the prynt of the nayles, and thruste my hande into his syde, I wyll not beleue.
{20:26} And after eyght dayes, againe his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: Then came Iesus, when the doores were shutte, and stoode in the myddes, and sayde, peace be vnto you.
{20:27} After that said he to Thomas: Bring thy fynger hyther, and see my handes, & reache hyther thy hande, and thrust it into my syde, and be not faythlesse, but beleuyng.
{20:28} Thomas aunswered, and sayde vnto hym: My Lorde, and my God.
{20:29} Iesus sayth vnto hym: Thomas, because thou hast seene me, thou hast beleued: Blessed are they that haue not seene, and yet haue beleued.
{20:30} And many other signes truely dyd Iesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this booke.
{20:31} These are written, that ye myght beleue that Iesus is Christe the sonne of God, and that in beleuyng, ye myght haue lyfe through his name.
{21:1} Afterward dyd Iesus shew him selfe againe to his disciples, at the sea of Tiberias. And on this wyse shewed he hym selfe.
{21:2} There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas which is called Didymus, and Nathanael, of Cana in Galilee, and the sonnes of Zebedee, & two other of his disciples.
{21:3} Simon Peter saith vnto them, I wyl go a fisshyng. They say vnto hym: We also wyll go with thee. They wet their way, and entred into a shippe immediatly, & that nyght caught they nothyng.
{21:4} But when the mornyng was nowe come, Iesus stoode on the shore: Neuerthelesse, the disciples knewe not that it was Iesus.
{21:5} Iesus sayth vnto them: Children, haue ye any meate? They aunswered hym, no.
{21:6} And he saith vnto them: Cast out the net on the ryght syde of the shippe, and ye shall fynde. They cast out therefore, and anone they were not able to drawe it for the multitude of fisshes.
{21:7} Then sayde the disciple, whom Iesus loued, vnto Peter: It is the Lord. Whe Simon Peter hearde that it was the Lorde, he gyrde his coate vnto him (for he was naked) and sprang into the sea.
{21:8} The other disciples came by shippe, (for they were not farre from lande, but as it were two hundred cubites) And they drewe the net with fisshes.
{21:9} Assoone then as they were come to lande, they sawe whot coales, and fisshe layde theron, and bread.
{21:10} Iesus saith vnto them: Bryng of the fisshe which ye haue nowe caught.
{21:11} Simon Peter went vp, and drewe the net to the lande, full of great fisshes, an hundred and fiftie and three: And for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
{21:12} Iesus sayth vnto them, come and dyne. And none of the disciples durst aske hym, who art thou? For they knewe that it was the Lorde.
{21:13} Iesus then came, and toke bread, and gaue them, and fisshe lykewyse.
{21:14} This is nowe the thirde tyme that Iesus appeared to his disciples, after that he was risen agayne from death.
{21:15} So when they had dyned, Iesus saith to Simon Peter: Simon Ioanna, louest thou me more then these? He sayd vnto hym: Yea Lorde, thou knowest that I loue thee. He sayth vnto hym: feede my lambes.
{21:16} He sayth to hym agayne the seconde tyme: Simon Ioanna, louest thou me? He sayth vnto hym: Yea Lorde, thou knowest that I loue thee. He sayde vnto hym: feede my sheepe.
{21:17} He sayde vnto hym the thirde tyme: Simon Ioanna, louest thou me? Peter was sory, because he sayde vnto hym the thirde tyme, louest thou me: And he sayde vnto hym, Lorde thou knowest all thynges, thou knowest that I loue thee. Iesus sayth vnto hym: feede my sheepe.
{21:18} Ueryly veryly I say vnto thee, when thou wast young, thou gyrdedst thy selfe, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be olde, thou shalt stretch foorth thy handes, and another shall gyrde thee, and leade thee whither thou wouldest not.
{21:19} That spake he, signifiyng by what death he should glorifie God. And whe he had spoken this, he sayth vnto hym, folowe me.
{21:20} Peter turned about, and sawe the disciple, whom Iesus loued, folowyng, which also leaned on his brest at supper, and sayde, Lorde which is he that betrayeth thee?
{21:21} When Peter therfore sawe hym, he sayth to Iesus: Lorde, what shal he do?
{21:22} Iesus sayth vnto hym: If I wyll haue hym to tary tyll I come, what is that to thee? folowe thou me.
{21:23} Then went this saying abrode among the brethren, that that disciple shoulde not dye: Yet Iesus sayde not to hym, he shall not dye: but, yf I wyll that he tary tyll I come, what is that to thee?
{21:24} The same disciple is he, which testifieth of these thynges, and wrote these thynges: And we knowe that his testimonie is true.
{21:25} There are also many other thynges, whiche Iesus dyd, the which, yf they shoulde be written euery one, I suppose the world could not conteine the bookes that shoulde be written.
