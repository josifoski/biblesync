{1:1} In the second yere of king Darius, in the sixth moneth, the first day of the moneth, came the word of the Lord by the ministerie of ye prophete Aggeus vnto Zorobabel the sonne of Salathiel a prince of Iuda, and to Iosua the sonne of Iosedech the hye priest, saying:
{1:2} Thus speaketh the Lorde of hoastes, saying: This people sayth, The time is not yet come for the Lordes house to be buylded.
{1:3} Then came the worde of the Lorde by the ministerie of the prophete Aggeus, saying:
{1:4} Is it time for you your selues to dwel in seeled houses, and this house lie wast?
{1:5} Nowe thus sayth the Lord of hoastes, Consider your owne wayes in your heartes.
{1:6} Ye haue sowen much, but ye bryng litle in: ye eate, but ye haue not inough: ye drinke, but ye are not filled: ye cloth you, but ye be not warme: and he that earneth wages, putteth the wages into a broken bagge.
{1:7} Thus sayth the Lorde of hoastes, Consider your owne wayes in your heartes.
{1:8} Get you vp to the mountayne, and fetche wood, and buyld this house, & I wil take pleasure in it, and I wilbe glorified, sayth the Lorde.
{1:9} Ye loked for much, and lo it came to litle, and when ye brought it home, I dyd blowe vpon it: and why, sayth the Lord of hoastes? because of my house that is waste, and you run euery man into his his owne house.
{1:10} Therfore vpon you the heauen is stayed from deawe, & the earth is stayed from yeelding her increase.
{1:11} And I haue called for a drought vpon the land, and vpon the mountaynes, and vpon the corne, & vpon the wine, and vpon the oyle, and vpon al that the ground bringeth foorth, vpon men, & vpon cattel, and vpon all the labour of the handes.
{1:12} When Zorobabel the sonne of Salathiel, and Iosua the sonne of Iosedech the hye priest, with all the remnaunt of the people, hearde the voyce of the Lorde their God, and the wordes of the prophete Haggeus, as the Lorde their God had sent him, then the people hyd feare before the Lorde.
{1:13} Then Haggeus the Lordes messenger sayd in the Lordes message vnto the people, saying: I am with you saith the Lorde.
{1:14} And the Lorde stirred vp the spirite of Zorobabel the sonne of Salathiel a prince of Iuda, and the spirite of Iosua the sonne of Iosedech the hie priest, and the spirite of all the people: & they came and dyd the worke in the house of the Lorde of hoastes their God.
{1:15} (2:1) In the twentie and fourth day of the sixt moneth, in the seconde yere of king Darius,
{2:1} (2:2) In the seuenth moneth in the twentie and one day of the moneth, came the worde of the Lord by the ministerie of the prophete Haggeus, saying:
{2:2} (2:3) Say nowe to Zorobabel the sonne of Salathiel prince of Iuda, and to Iosua the sonne of Iosedech the hie priest, and to rest of the people, saying:
{2:3} (2:4) Who is among you left, whiche sawe this house in her first glorie, and howe do you see it now? Is it not in your eyes in comparison of it, as nothing?
{2:4} (2:5) Yet nowe be of good cheare O Zorobabel, sayth the Lord, and be of good comfort O Iosua thou hye priest sonne of Iosedech, and be strong all ye people of the lande, sayth the Lorde, and worke: for I am with you sayth the Lorde of hoastes,
{2:5} (2:6) According to the worde that I couenaunted with you, when ye came out of Egypt: and my spirite shall remayne with you, feare ye not.
{2:6} (2:7) For thus sayth the Lorde of hoastes Yet a litle whyle, and I will shake the heauens, and the earth, and the sea, and the drie lande:
{2:7} (2:8) And I will moue all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glorie, sayth the Lorde of hoastes.
{2:8} (2:9) The siluer is myne, and the golde is myne, sayth the Lorde of hoastes.
{2:9} (2:10) The glorie of the seconde house, shalbe greater then the glorie of the first, sayth the Lorde of hoastes: and in this place will I geue peace, sayth the Lorde of hoastes.
{2:10} (2:11) In the twentie and fourth day of the nynth moneth in the second yere of king Darius, came the word of the Lord vnto the prophete Haggeus, saying:
{2:11} (2:12) Thus sayth the Lord God of hoastes, Aske nowe ye priestes concernyng the lawe, saying:
{2:12} (2:13) If one beare holy fleshe in the skirt of his coate, & with his skirt do touche the bread, potage, wine, oyle, or any other meate, shall it be holy? And the priestes aunswered and sayde, No.
{2:13} (2:14) And Haggeus sayd: If a polluted person touche any of these, shall he not be polluted? And the priestes aunswered, and saide, He shalbe polluted.
{2:14} (2:15) Then Haggeus aunswered, and sayde: So is this people, and so is this nation before me sayth the Lord, and so is al the worke of their handes: & that which they offer there is vncleane.
{2:15} (2:16) And nowe consider I pray you in your mindes from this day, and vpward, before there was layed one stone vpon an other in the house of the Lorde,
{2:16} (2:17) Before these thinges were done when one came to a heape of twentie measures there were but ten: so who came to the wyne presse for to drawe out fiftie vessels of wyne out of the presse, there were but twentie.
{2:17} (2:18) I smote you with blasting, and with mildeawe, and with hayle, in all the worke of your handes, and you turned not vnto me, sayth the Lorde.
{2:18} (2:19) Consider nowe in your mindes from this day, and afore, from the foure and twentie day of the nynth moneth, vnto the day that the foundation of the lordes temple was layde, consider it in your mindes:
{2:19} (2:20) Is the seede yet in the barne? as yet the vines, and the figge tree, and the pomegranate, & the oliue tree hath not brought foorth: from this day will I blesse you.
{2:20} (2:21) And againe the worde of the Lorde came vnto Haggei in the foure & twentie day of the moneth, saying:
{2:21} (2:22) Speake to Zorobabel the prince of Iuda, and say, I will shake the heauens and the earth:
{2:22} (2:23) And I will ouerthrow the throne of kingdomes, & I wil destroy the strength of the kingdomes of the heathen, and I will ouerthrowe the charettes and the sitters thereon, and the horse and the riders shall fall downe euery one by the sworde of his brother.
{2:23} (2:24) In that day, saith the Lord of hoastes, will I take thee Zorobabel my seruaunt sonne of Salathiel, sayth the Lord, & will make thee as a signet: for I haue chosen thee, sayth the Lorde of hoastes.
