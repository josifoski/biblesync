{1:1} These be the wordes whiche Moyses spake vnto all Israel on the other side Iordan in the wyldernesse, in ye playne ouer agaynst the red sea, betweene Pharan & Thophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Disahab.
{1:2} There are eleuen dayes iourney from Horeb, by the way of mount Seir, vnto Cades Barnea.
{1:3} And it came to passe in the first day of the eleuenth moneth, in the fourtie yere, that Moyses spake vnto the chyldren of Israel, accordyng vnto all that the Lord had geuen hym in commaundement vnto them:
{1:4} After he had slayne Sehon the king of the Amorites whiche dwelt in Hesbon, & Og king of Basan whiche dwelt at Astaroth in Edrai.
{1:5} On the other side Iordane in the land of Moab, began Moyses to declare this lawe, saying:
{1:6} The Lorde our God spake vnto vs in Horeb, saying: Ye haue dwelt long inough in this mount.
{1:7} Turne you and take your iourney, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and vnto all the places nye therevnto, both vnto the playne, and hilles, and dales, to the south, to the seas side, to the lande of Chanaan, and vnto Libanon, euen vnto the great riuer, the riuer Euphrates.
{1:8} Beholde, I haue set the lande before you: Go in and possesse the land which the Lord sware vnto your fathers, Abraham, Isahac, and Iacob, to geue vnto them, & to their seede after them.
{1:9} And I spake vnto you in the same time, saying: I am not able to beare you my selfe alone.
{1:10} For the Lorde your God hath multiplied you: so that you be this day as the starres of heauen in number.
{1:11} (The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many mo as ye are, and blesse you as he hath promised you.)
{1:12} Howe can I my selfe alone, beare your cumbraunce, your charge, & your stryfe that is among you?
{1:13} Bryng you men of wysdome, and of vnderstanding, and expert, accordyng to your tribes, and I wyll make them rulers ouer you.
{1:14} And ye aunswered me, & sayde: That which yu hast spoken, is good for vs to do.
{1:15} And so out of your tribes I toke the chiefe men of wysdome, and that were expert, and made them rulers ouer you, captaynes ouer thousandes, & captaines ouer hundredes, captaines ouer fiftie, and captaines ouer ten, and officers among your tribes.
{1:16} And I charged your Iudges that same tyme, saying: Heare the cause of your brethren, and iudge righteously betweene euery man and his brother, and the straunger that is with hym.
{1:17} Ye shall haue no respect of any person in iudgement, but you shall heare the small aswell as the great: You shall not feare the face of any man, for the iudgement is Gods. And the cause that is to harde for you, referre it vnto me, and I wyll heare it.
{1:18} And I comaunded you the same season, all the thinges which ye should do.
{1:19} And when we departed from Horeb, we went thorow all that great and terrible wyldernesse, as ye haue seene by the way of the mountayne of the Amorites, as the Lorde our God commaunded vs: and we came to Cades Barnea.
{1:20} And I sayd vnto you: Ye are come vnto ye mountaine of ye Amorites, which the Lorde our God doth geue vnto vs.
{1:21} Beholde, the Lorde thy God hath set the lande before thee: go vp and possesse it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath sayd vnto thee: feare not, neither be discouraged.
{1:22} And ye came vnto me euery one, and sayde: we wyll sende men before vs, to searche vs out the land, and to bryng vs worde agayne what way we must go vp by, & vnto what cities we shall come.
{1:23} And the saying pleased me well: and I toke twelue men of you, of euery tribe one.
{1:24} Whiche departed, & went vp into that mountayne, and came vnto the valley Eschol, and searched it out,
{1:25} And toke of the lande in their handes, and brought it vnto vs, and brought vs word agayne, and sayd: It is a good lande whiche the Lorde our God doth geue vs.
{1:26} Notwithstandyng, ye woulde not go vp, but were disobedient vnto the word of the Lorde your God,
{1:27} And murmured in your tentes, and said: Because ye Lord hateth vs, therfore hath he brought vs out of the lande of Egypt, to deliuer vs into the hande of the Amorites, and to destroy vs.
{1:28} Whyther shal we go vp? Our brethren haue discouraged our heart, saying: the people is greater and taller then we, the cities are great, and walled euen vp to heauen, and moreouer we haue seene the sonnes of the Anakims there.
{1:29} Then I sayde vnto you: Dreade not, nor be afraide of them.
{1:30} The Lorde your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, accordyng to all that he dyd vnto you in Egypt before your eyes:
{1:31} And in the wyldernesse, where thou hast seene howe that the Lord thy God bare thee, euen as a man doth beare his sonne, in al the way which ye haue gone by, vntill ye came vnto this place:
{1:32} And yet in this thing ye did not beleue the Lorde your God.
{1:33} He went in the way before you, to searche you out a place to pitche your tentes in, in fyre by nyght, yt ye myght see what way to go, & in a cloude by day.
{1:34} And the Lorde hearde the voyce of your wordes, & was wroth, and sware, saying:
{1:35} There shall not one of these men, and of this frowarde generation, see that good lande whiche I sware to geue vnto your fathers:
{1:36} Saue Caleb the sonne of Iephune, he shall see it, and to him wyll I geue the lande that he hath troden vpon, and to his chyldren, because he hath folowed the Lorde.
{1:37} Also the Lorde was angry with me for your sakes, saying: Thou also shalt not go in thyther.
{1:38} But Iosuah the sonne of Nun which standeth before thee, he shal go in thyther. Encourage hym therfore: for he shall cause Israel to inherite the lande.
{1:39} Moreouer, your chyldren, which ye sayde should be a pray, and your sonnes whiche in that day had no knowledge betweene good and euyll, they shall go in thyther, and vnto them wyll I geue it, and they shall enioy it.
{1:40} But as for you, turne your face, and take your iourney into the wildernesse, euen by the way of the red sea.
{1:41} Then ye aunswered and sayde vnto me, We haue sinned agaynst the Lord: we wyll go vp and fight, according to all that the Lorde our God commaunded vs. And when ye had gyrde on euery man his weapons of warre, ye were redie to go vp into the hyll.
{1:42} And the Lord sayd vnto me: Say vnto them, go not vp, neither fight, for I am not among you: lest ye fall before your enemies.
{1:43} And I tolde you these thynges, & you woulde not heare, but disobayed the worde of the Lord, and went presumptuously vp into the hyll.
{1:44} And the Amorites whiche dwelt in that mountayne, came out against you, and chased you as bees vse to do, and destroyed you in Seir, euen vnto Horma.
{1:45} And ye came agayne, and wept before the Lorde: but the Lorde would not heare your voyce, nor hearken vnto you.
{1:46} And so ye abode in Cades a long season, according vnto the tyme that ye remayned before. That whiche was done from the tyme they departed from Cades Barnea, vnto the battayle agaynst the kynges, Sehon and Og.
{2:1} Then we turned our face, & toke our iourney into the wyldernesse, euen by the way of the red sea, as the Lorde spake vnto me: And we compassed mount Seir a long tyme.
{2:2} And the Lord spake vnto me, saying:
{2:3} Ye haue compassed this mountayne long inough, turne you northwarde.
{2:4} Aud warne thou ye people, saying: Ye shall go through the coast of your brethren the chyldren of Esau which dwelt in Seir, and they shalbe afraide of you.
{2:5} Take ye good heede vnto your selues therfore: Ye shall not prouoke them, for I wyll not geue you of their lande, no not so much as a foote breadth, because I haue geuen mount Seir vnto Esau to possesse.
{2:6} Ye shall bye meate of them for money, to eate, and ye shall procure water of them for money, to drinke.
{2:7} For the Lorde thy God hath blessed thee in all the workes of thy hande, and knoweth thy walkyng through this great wyldernesse this fourtie yeres, and the Lorde thy God hath ben with thee, so that thou hast lacked nothing.
{2:8} And when we were departed from our brethren the children of Esau which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the wyldernesse from Elath, & from Ezion Gaber, we turned and went by the way of the wyldernesse of Moab.
{2:9} And the Lorde sayd vnto me: Thou shalt not fight agaynst the Moabites, neither prouoke them to battayle: for I wyll not geue thee of their lande to possesse, because I haue geuen Ar vnto the chyldren of Loth to possesse.
{2:10} The Emims dwelt therin in tymes past, a people great, many, and tall, as the Anakims,
{2:11} Whiche also were taken for giauntes as the Anakims, whom the Moabites call Emims.
{2:12} The Horims also dwelt in Seir before tyme, whom the chyldren of Esau chased out, & destroyed them before them, and dwelt in their steade, as Israel did vnto the lande of his possession, whiche the Lorde gaue them.
{2:13} Nowe ryse vp sayde and get you ouer the riuer Zared: and we went ouer the riuer Zared.
{2:14} The space in whiche we came from Cades Barnea, vntill we were come ouer the riuer Zared, was thirtie and eyght yeres, vntyll all the generation of the men of warre were wasted out from a mong the hoast, as the Lorde sware vnto them.
{2:15} For in deede the hande of the Lorde was against them to destroy them fro among ye hoast, til they were cosumed.
{2:16} And so it came to passe, that all the men of warre were consumed and dead from among the people.
{2:17} And the Lord spake vnto me, saying:
{2:18} Thou shalt go thorowe Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:
{2:19} And when thou commest nye vnto the chyldren of Ammon, thou shalt not lay siege vnto the, nor moue warre against them: For I wyll not geue thee of the lande of the chyldren of Ammon any possession, but I haue geuen it vnto the chyldren of Loth to possesse.
{2:20} That also was taken for a lande of giauntes, and giauntes dwelt therin in olde tyme, whom the Ammonites call Zamzummims.
{2:21} A people that was great, many, and tall, as the Anakims: But the Lorde destroyed them before them, and they succeeded them in their inheritaunce, and dwelt in their steade:
{2:22} As he dyd for the chyldren of Esau, whiche dwell in Seir, for whom he destroyed the Horims before them, and they possessed them, and dwelt in their steade vnto this day.
{2:23} And the Auims which dwelt in Hazarim, euen vnto Azza, the Caphthorims whiche came out of Caphthor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their steade.
{2:24} Rise ye vp therefore, & take your iourney ouer the ryuer Arnon: Beholde, I haue geuen into thy hande Sehon the Amorite, king of Hesbon and his lande: begin to possesse it, and prouoke hym to battayle.
{2:25} This day will I beginne to sende the feare and dread of thee vpon al nations that are vnder all the heauen, so that they whiche heare speake of thee, shall tremble and quake before thee.
{2:26} And so I sent messengers out of ye wildernes of Kedemoth, vnto Sehon king of Hesbo, with wordes of peace, saying:
{2:27} Let me passe through thy lande, I wyll go along by the hye way, I wyll neither turne vnto the ryght hande, nor to the left.
{2:28} Thou shalt sell me meate for money, for to eate, & geue me water for money, for to drinke: Only I wyll go through on my feete,
{2:29} As the children of Esau, which dwel in Seir, and the Moabites which dwel in Ar, dyd vnto me, vntyll I be come ouer Iordane, into the lande which the Lorde our God geueth vs.
{2:30} But Sehon ye kyng of Hesbon woulde not let vs passe by hym: for the Lorde thy God hardened his spirite, and made his heart obstinate, because he woulde deliuer him into thy hande, as it is come to passe this day.
{2:31} And the Lord said vnto me: Beholde, I haue begunne to geue Sehon & his lande before thee: begynne to possesse and inherite his lande.
{2:32} Then both Sehon and all his people came out agaynst vs to fight at Iaza.
{2:33} And the Lorde set hym before vs, and we smote hym, and his sonnes, and all his people.
{2:34} And we toke all his cities the same season, and slue the men, women, and children of all the cities, and let nothyng remayne,
{2:35} Saue the cattell onely we caught vnto our selues, and the spoyle of the cities which we toke.
{2:36} From Aroer which is by the brinke of the riuer of Arnon, and from the citie that is in the riuer, vnto Gilead, there was not one citie to strong for vs: The Lorde our God deliuered all vnto vs.
{2:37} Only vnto the lande of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor vnto euery place of the riuer Iabock, nor vnto the cities in the mountaynes, nor vnto whatsoeuer the Lorde our God forbad vs.
{3:1} Then we turned, and went vp the way to Basan: And Og the kyng of Basan came out agaynst vs, he and all his people, to fyght at Edrai.
{3:2} And the Lorde sayde vnto me: Feare hym not, for I wyll deliuer hym, and all his people, and his lande, into thy hande, and thou shalt do vnto hym, as thou diddest vnto Sehon kyng of the Amorites, which dwelt at Hesbon.
{3:3} And so the Lorde our God deliuered into our handes Og also the kyng of Basan, and all his folke: And we smote hym vntyll none was left hym alyue.
{3:4} And we toke all his cities the same season, neither was there a citie which we toke not from them, euen threescore cities throughout the region of Argob, of the kyngdome of Og in Basan.
{3:5} All these cities also were made strong with hye walles, gates, & barres, beside vnwalled townes a great meany,
{3:6} And we vtterly destroyed them, as we dyd vnto Sehon kyng of Hesbon, bryngyng to naught all the cities, with men, women, and children:
{3:7} But all the cattell and the spoyle of the cities, we toke for our selues.
{3:8} And thus we toke the same season out of the hande of two kynges of the Amorites, the land that was on the other side Iordane, from the riuer of Arnon, vnto mount Hermon:
{3:9} (Which Hermon the Sidons call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir)
{3:10} All the cities that lay in the playne, and all Gilead, and all Basan vnto Selcha and Edrai, cities of the kyngdome of Og in Basan:
{3:11} For only Og kyng of Basan, remayned of the remnaunt of the giauntes, whose bed was a bed of iron: And is it not yet at Rabbath among ye children of Ammon? Nine cubites doth the length therof contayne, and foure cubites the breadth of it, after the cubite of a man.
{3:12} And so we conquered this lande the same tyme, from Aroer which is by the riuer of Arnon, vnto halfe mount Gilead, and the cities therof gaue I vnto the Rubenites and Gadites.
{3:13} And the rest of Gilead, and all Basan of the kyngdome of Og, gaue I vnto the halfe tribe of Manasse: euen all the region of Argob, with all Basan, which is called the lande of giauntes.
{3:14} Iair the sonne of Manasse, toke all the countrey of Argob, vnto the coastes of Gessuri & Maachati, and called them after his owne name, Basan Hauoth Iair, vnto this day.
{3:15} And I gaue Gilead vnto Machir.
{3:16} And vnto the Rubenites and Gadites I gaue Gilead vnto the riuer of Arnon, halfe the valley and beyonde, euen vnto the riuer Iabock, which is the border of the children of Ammon:
{3:17} The playne also, and Iordane, and the coast therof, from Cenereth, euen vnto the sea which is in the playne, euen the salt sea vnder the springes of the hyll, eastwarde.
{3:18} And I commaunded you the same tyme, saying: The Lorde your God hath geuen you this lande to enioy it: ye shall go harnessed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meete for the warre.
{3:19} Your wyues only, your children, and your cattell (for I knowe that ye haue much cattell) shall abyde in your cities which I haue geuen you,
{3:20} Untyll the Lorde haue geuen rest vnto your brethren as well as vnto you, and vntyll they also possesse the lande which the Lorde your God hath geuen them beyonde Iordane: and then shall ye returne agayne, euery man vnto his possession which I haue geuen you.
{3:21} And I commaunded Iosuah hym selfe the same tyme, saying: Thyne eyes haue seene all that the Lorde your God hath done vnto these two kynges: euen so shall he do vnto all kyngdomes whither thou goest.
{3:22} Ye shall not feare them: for the Lorde your God he shall fyght for you.
{3:23} And I besought the Lorde the same tyme, saying:
{3:24} O Lorde God, thou hast begunne to shewe thy seruaunt thy greatnesse and thy mightie hande: for where is there a God in heauen or in earth, that can do after thy workes, and like to thy power?
{3:25} I pray thee let me go ouer, and see the good lande that is beyonde Iordane, that goodly mountayne, & Libanon.
{3:26} But the Lorde was angry with me for your sakes, and woulde not heare me. And the Lorde sayde vnto me: Be content, speake no more vnto me of this matter.
{3:27} Get thee vp into the top of the hyll, & lift vp thyne eyes westwarde, northwarde, southwarde, and eastwarde, and beholde it with thyne eyes: for thou shalt not go ouer this Iordane.
{3:28} But charge Iosuah, and encourage hym, and bolden hym: For he shall go before this people, and he shall deuide vnto the the lande which thou shalt see.
{3:29} And so we abode in the valley ouer agaynst the house of Peor.
{4:1} Nowe therfore harken O Israel, vnto the ordinaunces and lawes which I teache you, for to do them, that so ye may lyue, and go in, & possesse the lande which the Lorde God of your fathers geueth you.
{4:2} Ye shall put nothyng vnto the word which I commaunde you, neither shall you take ought from it, that ye may kepe the comaundementes of the Lord your God which I commaunde you.
{4:3} Your eyes haue seene what ye Lorde dyd agaynst Baal Peor: for all the men that folowed Baall Peor, the Lorde thy God hath destroyed from among you.
{4:4} But ye that cleaue vnto the Lord your god, are aliue euery one of you this day.
{4:5} Beholde I haue taught you ordinaunces and lawes, such as the Lorde my God comaunded me, that ye should do euen so in the lande whither ye go to possesse it.
{4:6} Kepe them therfore and do them, for that is your wisdome and vnderstandyng in the syght of the people, that they may heare all these ordinaunces, and say: Surely it is a wise and vnderstandyng people, it is a great nation.
{4:7} For what other nation is so great that gods come so nye vnto, as the Lorde our God is nye vnto vs in all thinges as oft as we call vnto hym?
{4:8} Yea, and what nation is so great, that hath ordinaunces & lawes so righteous, as all this lawe which I set before you this day?
{4:9} Take heede to thy selfe therefore, and kepe thy soule diligently, that thou forget not the thynges which thyne eyes haue seene, and that they depart not out of thy heart all the dayes of thy life: but teache them thy sonnes, & thy sonnes sonnes.
{4:10} Specially the day that thou stoodest before the Lorde thy God in Horeb, when the Lorde sayd vnto me: Gather me the people together, & I wyll make them heare my wordes, that they may learne to feare me all the dayes that they shall lyue vpon the earth, and that they may teache their children.
{4:11} Ye came and stoode also vnder the mountayne, and the mountayne burnt with fire euen vnto the middes of heauen, and there was darknesse, cloudes, and mist.
{4:12} And the Lorde spake vnto you out of the middes of the fire, and ye hearde the voyce of the wordes: but sawe no similitude, saue hearde a voyce only.
{4:13} And he declared vnto you his couenaunt which he commaunded you to do euen ten commaundementes, which he wrote vpon two tables of stone.
{4:14} And the Lorde commaunded me that same season that I shoulde teache you ordinaunces & lawes, which ye ought to do in the lande whyther ye go to possesse it.
{4:15} Take therfore good heede vnto your selues as pertaynyng vnto your soules, (for ye sawe no maner of image in the day that the Lorde spake vnto you in Horeb, out of the middes of fire)
{4:16} Lest ye marre your selues, & make you a grauen image, & picture of any maner of figure, whether it be the likenesse of man or woman.
{4:17} The likenesse of any maner of beast that is on the earth, or the likenesse of any maner fethered foule that fleeth in the ayre,
{4:18} Or the likenesse of any maner worme that creepeth on the earth, or the likenesse of any maner fishe that is in the waters beneath the earth:
{4:19} Yea, and lest thou lift vp thyne eyes vnto heauen, and when thou seest the sunne, the moone, and the starres, with all the hoast of heauen, shouldest be driuen to worship them, & serue them, and shouldest worship and serue the thynges, which the Lorde thy God hath made to serue all nations vnder the whole heauen.
{4:20} But the Lorde hath taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, euen out of Egypt, to be vnto hym a people & inheritaunce, as ye be this day.
{4:21} Furthermore, the Lorde was angry with me for your wordes, and sware that I shoulde not go ouer Iordane, and that I shoulde not go in vnto that good lande which the Lorde thy God geueth thee to inheritaunce.
{4:22} But I must dye in this lande, and shal not go ouer Iordane: But ye shall go ouer, and possesse that good lande.
{4:23} Take heede vnto your selues, that ye forget not ye appoyntment of the Lorde your God which he made with you, & that ye make you no grauen image or likenesse that the Lorde thy God hath forbidden thee.
{4:24} For the Lorde thy God, is a consumyng fire, and a ielous God.
{4:25} When thou shalt beget children, and thy children beget children, and shalt haue remayned long in the lande, ye do wickedly, & make any maner of grauen image, and worke euyll in the sight of the Lorde thy God, to prouoke hym to anger:
{4:26} I call heauen and earth to recorde agaynst you this day, that ye shall shortly perishe from of ye lande whervnto you go ouer Iordane to possesse it: Ye shall not prolong your dayes therin, but shall vtterly be destroyed:
{4:27} And the Lord shall scatter you among the people, and ye shalbe left fewe in number among the nations whyther the Lorde shall bryng you.
{4:28} And there ye shall serue gods which are the worke of mans hande, wood and stone, which neither see, nor heare, nor eate, nor smell.
{4:29} If from thence thou shalt seke the Lorde thy God, thou shalt finde hym, if thou seke hym with all thy heart, and with all thy soule.
{4:30} When thou art in tribulation, & when all these thynges that be here spoken of, are come vpon thee, euen in the latter dayes yf thou turne to the Lorde thy God, & shalt be obedient vnto his voyce:
{4:31} (For the Lorde thy God is a mercifull God) he wyll not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the appoyntment of thy fathers, which he sware vnto them.
{4:32} For aske of the dayes that are past, which were before & since the day that God created man vpon the earth, and aske from the one side of heauen vnto the other, if euer there came to passe such a great thyng, or whether any such lyke thyng hath ben hearde as this.
{4:33} Dyd euer any people heare the voyce of God speakyng out of the middes of a fire, as thou hast hearde, and yet lyued?
{4:34} Or hath God assayed to go and take hym a people from among nations, by temptations, by signes, by wonders, by warre, by a mightie hand, by a stretched out arme, & by great sightes, accordyng vnto all that the Lorde your God dyd vnto you in Egypt before your eyes?
{4:35} Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest knowe that the Lord is God, and that there is none other but he.
{4:36} Out of heauen he made thee heare his voyce, that he might instruct thee: & vpon earth he shewed thee his great fire, and thou heardest his worde out of the middes of the fire.
{4:37} And because he loued thy fathers, he chose their seede after them, & brought thee out in his sight with his mightie power out of Egypt,
{4:38} To thrust out nations great and mightier then thou before thee, and to bryng thee in, and to geue thee their lande to inheritaunce, as it is come to passe this day.
{4:39} Understande therfore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the Lorde he is God in heauen aboue, and vpon the earth beneath, neither is there any other.
{4:40} Thou shalt kepe therefore his ordinaunces and his commaundementes which I commaunde thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy dayes vpon ye earth, which the Lorde thy God geueth thee for euer.
{4:41} Then Moyses seuered three cities on the other side Iordane towarde the sunne rysyng:
{4:42} That he shoulde flee thyther which had kylled his neyghbour vnwares, & hated hym not in tyme past, and therfore shoulde flee vnto one of the same cities, and lyue:
{4:43} Namely Bezer in the wildernesse, euen in the playne countrey of the tribe of Ruben, and Ramoth in Gilead, of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Basan, of the tribe of Manasse.
{4:44} And so this is the lawe which Moyses set before the children of Israel:
{4:45} These are the witnesse, statutes, and ordinaunces, which Moyses tolde the children of Israel after they came out of Egypt,
{4:46} On the other side Iordane, in the valley ouer agaynst the house of Peor, in the lande of Sehon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Hesbon, whom Moyses & the children of Israel smote, after they were come out of Egypt,
{4:47} And possessed his lande, and the lande of Og kyng of Basan, two kynges of the Amorites, which were on the other side Iordane towarde the sunne rising,
{4:48} From Aroer which is by the bancke of the riuer Arnon, vnto mount Sion which is Hermon,
{4:49} And all the playne on the other side Iordane eastwarde, euen vnto the sea which is in the playne vnder ye springes of the hyll.
{5:1} And Moyses called all Israel, and sayde vnto them: Heare O Israel the ordinauces and lawes which I speake in your eares this day, that ye may learne them, and fulfill them in deede.
{5:2} The Lord our God made a couenaunt with vs in Horeb.
{5:3} The Lorde made not this couenaunt with our fathers, but with vs: euen with vs, which are all here alyue this day.
{5:4} The Lorde talked with you face to face in the mount, out of the middes of the fire:
{5:5} And I stoode betweene the Lorde and you the same tyme, and shewed you the worde of the Lord: For ye were afrayde at the sight of the fire, and went not vp into the mount, and he sayde:
{5:6} I am the Lorde thy God, which brought thee out of the lande of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
{5:7} Thou shalt haue none other Gods in my presence.
{5:8} Thou shalt make thee no grauen image, or any likenesse of that which is in heauen aboue, and that is in earth beneath, and that is in the waters beneath the earth.
{5:9} Thou shalt neither bowe thy selfe vnto them, nor serue them: for I the Lord thy God, am a ielouse God, visityng the wickednesse of the fathers vpon the children, euen vnto the third and fourth generation among them that hate me:
{5:10} And shewe mercie vpon thousandes, among them that loue me, and kepe my commaundementes.
{5:11} Thou shalt not take the name of the Lorde thy God in vayne: for the Lorde wyll not holde him giltlesse that taketh his name in vayne.
{5:12} Kepe the Sabbath day, that thou sanctifie it as the Lorde thy God hath commaunded thee.
{5:13} Sixe dayes thou shalt labour, and do all that thou hast to do:
{5:14} But the seuenth day is the Sabbath of the Lorde thy God: thou shalt not do any worke, thou nor thy sonne, nor thy daughter, nor thy man seruaunt, nor thy mayde, nor thine oxe, nor thine asse, nor any of thy cattell, nor the straunger that is within thy gates: that thy man seruaunt, and thy mayde, may rest as well as thou.
{5:15} Remember that thou wast a seruaunt in the lande of Egypt, and howe that the Lorde thy God brought thee out thence, through a mightie hande and a stretched out arme: For which cause the Lorde thy God commaunded thee to kepe the Sabbath day.
{5:16} Honour thy father & thy mother, as the Lorde thy God hath commaunded thee: that thy dayes may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee in the lande which the Lorde thy God geueth thee.
{5:17} Thou shalt not slay.
{5:18} Thou shalt not commit adulterie.
{5:19} Thou shalt not steale.
{5:20} Thou shalt not beare false witnesse agaynst thy neyghbour.
{5:21} Thou shalt not lust after thy neyghbours wyfe, thou shalt not couet thy neyghbours house, his fielde, his seruaunt, or his mayde, his oxe, his asse, or ought that thy neyghbour hath.
{5:22} These wordes the Lorde spake vnto all your multitude in the mount, out of the middes of the fire, of the cloude, and of the darkenesse, with a great voyce, and added nothyng: and wrote them in two tables of stone, and deliuered them vnto me.
{5:23} And it came to passe, that when ye hearde the voyce out of the middes of the darkenesse (for the mountayne dyd burne with fire) then ye came vnto me, with the captaynes of your tribes, and your elders,
{5:24} And ye sayde: Beholde, the Lorde our God hath shewed vs his glorie and his greatnesse, and we haue hearde his voyce out of the middes of the fire: we haue seene this day that God doth talke with man, and he yet lyueth.
{5:25} Nowe therfore why shoulde we dye? that this great fire shoulde consume vs: If we heare the voyce of the Lord our God any more, we shall dye:
{5:26} For what fleshe hath it ben that euer hearde the voyce of the lyuyng God speakyng out of the middes of the fire (as we haue done) and yet dyd lyue?
{5:27} Go thou and heare all that the Lorde our God sayth, and tell thou vnto vs all that the Lord our God sayth vnto thee, and we wyll heare it, and do it.
{5:28} And the Lorde hearde the voyce of your wordes when ye spake vnto me, and the Lorde sayde vnto me: I haue hearde the voyce of the wordes of this people, which they haue spoken vnto thee: they haue well sayde all that they haue spoken.
{5:29} Oh that there were such an heart in them that they woulde feare me, & kepe all my comaundementes alway, that it myght go well with them, and with their childen for euer?
{5:30} Go, and say vnto them, Get you into your tentes agayne:
{5:31} But stande thou here by me, and I wyll tell thee all the comaundementes, ordinaunces, & lawes, which thou shalt teache them, that they may do them in the lande which I geue the to possesse.
{5:32} Take heede therfore that ye do in deede as the Lord your God hath commaunded you, and turne not aside, either to the right hande, or to the left:
{5:33} But walke in all the wayes which the Lorde your God hath comaunded you, that ye may lyue, and that it may go well with you, and that ye may prolong your dayes in the lande which ye shall possesse.
{6:1} These are the comaundemetes, ordinaunces, and lawes, which the Lorde your God commaunded me to teache you, that ye might do them in the lande whither ye go to possesse it:
{6:2} Namely, that thou mightest feare the Lord thy God, & kepe all his ordinaunces and his commaundementes which I commaunde thee, thou & thy sonne, & thy sonnes sonne all the dayes of thy lyfe: that thy dayes may be prolonged.
{6:3} Heare therfore O Israel, and take heede that thou do it, that it may go well with thee, & that ye may encrease mightily, euen as the Lorde God of thy fathers hath promised thee, a lande that floweth with mylke and honie.
{6:4} Heare O Israel, the Lorde our God is Lorde only.
{6:5} And thou shalt loue the Lorde thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy myght.
{6:6} And these wordes which I commaunde thee this day, shalbe in thine heart:
{6:7} And thou shalt shewe them vnto thy children, and shalt talke of them when thou art at home in thine house, and as thou walkest by the way, & when thou lyest downe, and when thou risest vp.
{6:8} And thou shalt binde them for a signe vpon thine hande, and they shalbe as frontlettes betweene thine eyes,
{6:9} And thou shalt write them vpon the postes of thy house, & vpon thy gates.
{6:10} And when the Lorde thy God hath brought thee into the lande which he sware vnto thy fathers, Abraham, Isahac, and Iacob, and shall geue to thee great & goodly cities which thou buildedst not,
{6:11} Houses full of all maner of goodes which thou filledst not, & welles digged which thou diggedst not, vineyardes and oliue trees which thou plantedst not, and when thou hast eaten & art full:
{6:12} Then beware lest thou forget ye Lorde which brought thee out of the lande of Egypt from the house of bondage.
{6:13} Thou shalt feare the Lorde thy God and serue hym, and shalt sweare by his name.
{6:14} See that ye walke not after straunge gods, the gods of the nations which are about you:
{6:15} (For the Lorde thy God is a ielous God among you) lest the countenaunce of the Lorde thy God be moued to wrath agaynst thee, and destroy thee from the face of the earth.
{6:16} Ye shall not tempt the Lorde your God, as ye dyd in the place of temptation.
{6:17} But you shall diligently kepe the commaundementes of the Lord your God, & his testimonies, and his ordinaunces which he hath commaunded thee:
{6:18} And thou shalt do that which is right & good in the sight of the Lorde: that thou mayst prosper, and that thou mayst go in, & possesse that good lande which the Lorde sware vnto thy fathers,
{6:19} To cast out all thine enemies before thee, as the Lorde hath sayde.
{6:20} And when thy sonne asketh thee in tyme to come, saying: What meaneth these testimonies, ordinaunces, and lawes, which the Lorde our God hath commaunded you?
{6:21} Then thou shalt say vnto thy sonne: We were Pharaos bondmen in Egypt, and the Lorde brought vs out of Egypt with a mightie hande:
{6:22} And the Lorde shewed signes, and wonders, great and euyll vpon Egypt, vpon Pharao, and vpon all his householde, before our eyes:
{6:23} And brought vs out from thence, to bryng vs in and to geue vs the lande which he sware vnto our fathers.
{6:24} And he hath commaunded vs to do all these ordinaunces, & to feare the Lorde our God for our wealth all the dayes of our lyfe, as it is come to passe this day.
{6:25} Moreouer, this shalbe our righteousnesse before the Lorde our God, if we take heede, & kepe all these commaundementes, as he hath commaunded vs.
{7:1} When the Lord thy God shall bryng thee into ye lande whither thou goest to possesse it, and hath cast out many nations before thee: Namely the Hethites, the Gergesites, the Amorites, the Chanaanites, the Pherezites, the Heuites, & the Iebusites, seuen nations, greater and mightier then thou:
{7:2} And when the Lorde thy God hath set them before thee, thou shalt smyte them, and vtterly destroy them, & make no couenaunt with them, nor haue compassion on them.
{7:3} Thou shalt make no mariages with them: neither geue thy daughter vnto his sonne, nor take his daughter vnto thy sonne.
{7:4} For they wyll deceaue thy sonne, that he shoulde not folowe me, and they shal serue straunge gods: and then wyll the wrath of the Lorde waxe hot agaynst thee, and destroy thee sodenly.
{7:5} But thus ye shall deale with them: Ye shall ouerthrowe their aulters, & breake downe their pillers, cut downe their groues, and burne their grauen images with fire:
{7:6} For thou art an holy people vnto the Lorde thy God, the Lorde thy God hath chosen thee, to be a speciall people vnto hym selfe, aboue all nations that are vpon the earth.
{7:7} The Lorde dyd not set his loue vpon you, nor chose you because ye were mo in number then any people (for ye were the fewest of all people)
{7:8} But because the Lorde loued you, and because he would kepe the othe which he had sworne vnto your fathers, therfore hath the Lorde brought you out through a mightie hande, and deliuered you out of the house of bondage, euen from the hande of Pharao kyng of Egypt.
{7:9} Understande therfore, that the Lorde thy God he is God, and that a true God, which kepeth appoyntment and mercie vnto them that loue hym and kepe his commaundementes, euen throughout a thousande generations:
{7:10} And rewardeth them that hate hym to their face, so that he bryngeth them to naught, and doth not deferre the tyme, but rewardeth hym that hateth hym before his face.
{7:11} Kepe thou therfore the commaundementes, and ordinaunces, and lawes, which I commaunde thee this day, that thou do them.
{7:12} If ye hearken vnto these lawes, and obserue & do them: the Lord thy God also shall kepe vnto thee the appoyntment and the mercie which he sware vnto thy fathers.
{7:13} He wyll loue thee, and blesse thee, and multiplie thee: he wyll also blesse the fruite of thy wombe, and the fruite of thy lande, thy corne, thy wine, and thine oyle, and the increase of thy kine, and the flockes of thy sheepe, in the lande which he sware vnto thy fathers to geue thee.
{7:14} Thou shalt be blessed aboue all nations: there shalbe neither man nor woman vnfruitfull among you, nor any of your cattell shalbe barren.
{7:15} Moreouer the Lorde wyll take away from thee all maner infirmities, & wyll put none of the euyll diseases of Egypt (which thou knowest) vpon thee: but wil sende them vpon all them that hate thee.
{7:16} Thou shalt consume all the nations which the Lorde thy God shall deliuer thee: thine eye shall haue no pitie vpon them, neither shalt thou serue their gods, for that shalbe thy decay.
{7:17} If thou say in thine heart: these nations are mo then I, howe can I cast them out?
{7:18} Thou shalt not feare them: but remember what the Lorde thy God dyd vnto Pharao and vnto all Egypt.
{7:19} The great temptations which thine eyes sawe, and the signes, & wonders, and the mightie hande, and stretched out arme, wherby the Lorde thy God brought thee out: euen so shall the Lord thy God do vnto all nations of whom thou art afrayde.
{7:20} Moreouer the Lorde thy God wyll sende hornets among them, vntil they that are left, and hide them selues from thee, be destroyed.
{7:21} Thou shalt not feare the: for the Lord thy God is among you, a mightie God and a terrible.
{7:22} For the Lorde thy God wyll put out these nations before thee by a litle and a litle: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beastes of the fielde increase vpon thee.
{7:23} But the Lorde thy God shall geue them ouer before thee, and shall destroy them with a mightie destruction, vntyll he haue brought them to naught.
{7:24} And he shall deliuer their kynges into thine hande, and thou shalt destroye their name from vnder heauen: There shall no man be able to stande before thee, vntyll thou haue destroyed them.
{7:25} The graue images of their gods shalt thou burne with fire: and couet not the golde and siluer that is on them, nor take it vnto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an abhomination before the Lorde thy God.
{7:26} Bryng not therfore abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thyng as it is: but vtterly defie it and abhorre it, for it is a cursed thyng.
{8:1} All the commaundementes which I commaunde thee this day, shal ye kepe for to do the, that ye may liue, and multiplie, and go in and possesse the lande which the Lorde sware vnto your fathers.
{8:2} And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lorde thy God led thee this fourtie yeres in the wildernesse, for to humble thee, & to proue thee, and to knowe what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest kepe his comaundementes, or no.
{8:3} He humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, & fed thee with Manna, which neither thou nor thy fathers knewe of, to make thee knowe that a man doth not lyue by bread only: but by euery worde that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lorde, doth a man lyue.
{8:4} Thy rayment waxed not olde vpon thee, neither dyd thy foote swell these fourtie yeres.
{8:5} This also shalt thou consider in thine heart: that as a man chastiseth his sonne, euen so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee.
{8:6} Therefore shalt thou kepe the commaundementes of the Lorde thy God, that thou walke in his wayes, and feare hym.
{8:7} For the Lorde thy God bryngeth thee into a good lande, a lande in the whiche are riuers of water, and fountaines and deapthes that spring out of valleys and hylles:
{8:8} A lande wherin is wheate and barlie, vineyardes, fightrees, & pomgranates, a lande wherein is oyle oliue and honie:
{8:9} A lande wherin thou shalt eate bread without scarcenes, neither shalt thou lacke any thyng: a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hylles thou shalt digge brasse.
{8:10} When thou hast eaten therfore & filled thy selfe, thou shalt blesse the Lorde thy God for the good lande whiche he hath geuen thee.
{8:11} Beware that thou forget not the Lorde thy God, that thou wouldest not kepe his comaundementes, his lawes, and his ordinaunces, whiche I commaunde thee this day:
{8:12} Yea, and when thou hast eaten and filled thy selfe, and hast buylt goodly houses and dwelt therein:
{8:13} And when thy beastes and thy sheepe are waxen many, and thy siluer and golde is multiplied, and all that thou hast is encreased:
{8:14} Then beware lest thyne heart ryse, and thou forget the Lorde thy God, whiche brought thee out of the lande of Egypt, and from the house of bondage:
{8:15} And whiche was thy guyde in the great and terrible wyldernesse wherein were firie serpentes, scorpions, and drouth without any water: But he brought out water for thee, euen out of the rocke of flint.
{8:16} He fed thee in the wyldernesse with Manna, which thy fathers knewe not, euen for to humble thee, and to proue thee, and that he might so do thee good at thy latter ende,
{8:17} Lest thou shouldest say in thine heart, my power and the myght of myne owne hande hath prepared me this aboundaunce:
{8:18} But remember the Lorde thy God, for it is he whiche geueth thee power to get substaunce, for to make good the promise whiche he sware vnto thy fathers, as appeareth this day.
{8:19} And if thou forget the Lord thy God, and walke after straunge gods, and serue them, and worship them: I testifie vnto you this day, that ye shal surely perishe.
{8:20} As the nations whiche the Lorde destroyed before your face, euen so ye shall perishe, because ye woulde not be obedient vnto the voyce of ye Lord your God.
{9:1} Heare O Israel, thou passest ouer Iordane this day, to go in and possesse nations great and mightier then thy selfe, cities great and walled vp to heauen:
{9:2} A people great & tall, euen the children of the Anakims, whiche thou knowest of, & of whom thou hast heard say, who wyll stand before the children of Anac?
{9:3} Understande therefore this day, that the Lorde thy God is euen he whiche goeth ouer before thee as a consuming fire, he shall destroy them, and he shall bryng them downe before thy face: So thou shalt caste them out, and bryng them to naught quickly, as the Lorde hath sayde vnto thee.
{9:4} Speake not thou in thyne heart, after that the Lorde thy God hath cast them out before thee, saying, for my ryghteousnesse the Lorde hath brought me in, to possesse this lande: but for the wickednesse of these nations the Lord hath cast them out before thee.
{9:5} It is not for thy righteousnesse sake, or for thy right heart, that thou goest to possesse their lande: But for the wickednesse of these nations, the Lord thy God doth cast them out before thee, eue to perfourme the worde whiche the Lord thy God sware vnto thy fathers. Abraham, Isahac, and Iacob.
{9:6} Understand therfore that it is not for thy righteousnes sake, that the Lorde thy God doth geue thee this good lande to possesse it, seyng thou art a stifnecked people.
{9:7} Remember & forget not, howe thou prouokedst the Lorde thy God in the wildernesse, since the day that thou diddest depart out of the lande of Egypt, vntyll ye came vnto this place, ye haue rebelled agaynst the Lorde.
{9:8} Also in Horeb ye prouoked the Lord to anger, so that the Lorde was wroth with you, euen to haue destroyed you.
{9:9} When I was gone vp into the mount, to receaue the tables of stone, the tables of the couenaunt which the Lord made with you, and I abode in the mount fourtie dayes & fourtie nightes, whe I neither did eate bread nor drinke water.
{9:10} And the Lorde deliuered me two tables of stone, written with the finger of God, and in them was contayned all the wordes whiche the Lorde saide vnto you in the mount out of ye middes of fire, in the day when ye came together.
{9:11} And when the fourtie dayes and fourtie nightes were ended, the Lorde gaue me the two tables of stone, the tables of the couenaunt.
{9:12} And the Lord sayde vnto me: Arise, and get thee downe quickly from hence, for thy people which thou hast brought out of Egypt, haue marred all: They are turned at once out of the waye which I commaunded them, and haue made them a moulten image.
{9:13} Furthermore, the Lorde spake vnto me, saying: I haue seene this people, and beholde it is a stifnecked people.
{9:14} Let me alone, that I may destroy them, & put out the name of them from vnder heauen, and I wyll make of thee a mightie nation, & greater then they be.
{9:15} And I turned me, and came downe from the hyll, euen from the hyll that burnt with fire, and the two tables of the couenaunt were in my handes.
{9:16} And I loked, and beholde ye had sinned against the Lorde your God, and had made you a moulten calfe, and had turned at once out of the way whiche the Lorde had commaunded you.
{9:17} And I toke the two tables, and cast them out of my two handes, and brake them before your eyes.
{9:18} And I fell downe flat before the Lord euen as at the first time, & fourtie dayes and fourtie nightes I did neither eate bread nor drinke water, because of all your sinnes which ye sinned, in doyng wyckedly in the sight of the Lorde in that ye prouoked hym vnto wrath.
{9:19} (For I was afrayde, that for the wrath and fiercenes wherwith the Lord was moued agaynst you, he would haue destroyed you) But the Lorde heard me at that tyme also.
{9:20} The Lorde was very angry with Aaron also, euen to haue destroyed hym: and I made intercession for Aaron also the same tyme.
{9:21} And I toke your sinne, the calfe which ye had made, and burnt hym with fire, and stamped hym, and grounde hym very small, euen to dust: and I cast the dust therof into the brooke that descended out of the mount.
{9:22} Also at the burnyng place, at the place of temptyng, and at the sepulchres of lust, ye prouoked the Lorde to anger.
{9:23} Likewise when the Lorde sent you from Cades Barnea, saying, go vp and possesse the lande which I haue geuen you: you rebelled against the worde of the Lorde your God, and neither beleued him, nor hearkened vnto his voyce.
{9:24} You haue ben rebellious vnto the Lorde since the day that I knewe you.
{9:25} And I fell downe flat before the Lorde fourtie dayes & fourtie nightes, as I fell downe before: for the Lorde sayde, he woulde destroy you.
{9:26} I made intercession therfore vnto the Lord, and sayd: O Lord God, destroy not thy people and thyne inheritaunce whiche thou hast deliuered through thy great goodnesse, and whiche thou hast brought out of Egypt thorowe a myghtie hande.
{9:27} Remember thy seruauntes, Abraham, Asahac, and Iacob, and looke not vnto the stubbernesse of this people, nor to their wickednesse and sinne:
{9:28} Lest the lande whence thou broughtest them, say, The Lorde is not able to bryng them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, therefore hath he caryed them out to slay them in the wyldernesse.
{9:29} Beholde, they are thy people, & thyne inheritaunce, whiche thou broughtest out in thy myghtie power, and in thy stretched out arme.
{10:1} In the same season the Lorde sayde vnto me: hewe thee two tables of stone lyke vnto the first, and come vp vnto me into the mount, and make thee an arke of wood.
{10:2} And I wyll wryte in the tables, the wordes that were in the first tables whiche thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the arke.
{10:3} And I made an arke of Sittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone lyke vnto the first, and went vp into the mountayne, hauyng the two tables in myne hande.
{10:4} And he wrote in the tables according to the first wrytyng, the ten commaundementes whiche the Lord spake vnto you in the mount out of the myddes of the fire, in the day when you were gathered together: and the Lorde gaue them vnto me.
{10:5} And I departed, and came downe from the hyll, and put the tables in the arke whiche I had made, and there they be, as the Lorde commaunded me.
{10:6} And the chyldren of Israel toke their iourney from Beroth of the chyldren of Iakan to Mosera, where Aaron dyed and was buryed, and Eleazer his sonne became priest in his steade.
{10:7} From thence they departed vnto Gudgodah: and from Gudgodah to Iethebath, a lande whiche hath riuers of waters.
{10:8} The same season the Lorde seperated the tribe of Leui, to beare the arke of the couenaunt of the Lorde, and to stande before the Lorde, and to minister vnto hym, and to blesse in his name vnto this day.
{10:9} Wherefore the Leuites haue no part nor inheritaunce with their brethren: but the Lorde is their inheritaunce, as the Lorde thy God hath promised them.
{10:10} And I taryed in the mount, euen as at the first time, fourtie dayes and fourtie nyghtes: and the Lorde hearde me at that tyme also, and the Lorde would not destroy thee.
{10:11} And the Lorde sayde vnto me: Arise, and go foorth in the iourneys before the people, that they may go in and possesse the lande whiche I sware vnto their fathers to geue vnto them.
{10:12} And now Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to feare the Lorde thy God, and to walke in all his wayes, to loue hym, and to serue the Lord thy God with all thyne heart, and with all thy soule?
{10:13} Namely, that thou kepe the comaundementes of the Lorde, and his ordinaunces whiche I commaunde thee this day for thy wealth.
{10:14} Beholde, heauen and the heauen of heauens, is the Lordes thy God, and the earth with all that therin is.
{10:15} Notwithstandyng, the Lorde had a delight in thy fathers to loue them, and chose their seede after them, euen you aboue all nations, as thou seest this day.
{10:16} Circumcise therefore the foreskinne of your heart, and be no more stifnecked.
{10:17} For the Lorde your God, is God of Gods, and Lorde of Lordes, a great God, a mightie and a terrible, whiche regardeth no mans person, nor taketh rewarde.
{10:18} He doth right vnto the fatherlesse and wydowe, and loueth the straunger, to geue hym foode and rayment.
{10:19} Loue ye therfore the straunger also: for ye were straungers your selues in the lande of Egypt.
{10:20} Thou shalt feare the Lord thy God, and hym only shalt thou serue, to hym shalt thou cleaue, and sweare by his name.
{10:21} He is thy prayse, & thy God that hath done for thee these great and terrible thinges whiche thyne eyes haue seene.
{10:22} Thy fathers went downe into Egypt with threscore and ten persons: and nowe the Lorde thy God hath made thee & multiplied thee as the starres of heauen.
{11:1} Therefore thou shalt loue ye Lord thy God, & kepe his obseruannces, his ordinaunces, his lawes, & his commaudementes alway.
{11:2} Know you this day, (for I speake not to your chyldren which haue neither knowen nor seene) the chastisement of the Lord your God, his greatnesse, his mightie hande, and his stretched out arme,
{11:3} His miracles and his actes whiche he dyd in the middes of Egypt, euen vnto Pharao the king of Egypt, and vnto all his lande:
{11:4} And what he dyd vnto the hoast of Egypt, vnto their horses and charets: howe he brought the water of the red sea vpon them as they pursued you behinde, and how the Lord hath brought them to naught vnto this day:
{11:5} And what he did vnto you in the wildernesse, vntill ye came vnto this place:
{11:6} And what he dyd vnto Dathan and Abiram the sonnes of Eliab the sonne of Ruben: howe the earth opened her mouth and swalowed them, with their housholdes & their tentes, and all their substaunce that was in their possession, in the middes of Israel.
{11:7} Doubtlesse, your eyes haue seene all the great actes of the Lorde whiche he dyd.
{11:8} Therefore shall ye kepe all the commaundementes whiche I commaunde thee this day, that ye may be strong and go in and possesse the lande whyther ye go to possesse it:
{11:9} And that ye may prolong your dayes in the lande whiche the Lorde sware vnto your fathers, to geue vnto them and to their seede, a lande that floweth with mylke and honie.
{11:10} For the lande whyther thou goest to possesse it, is not as the lande of Egypt that ye came out of, where thou sowedst thy seede, and wateredst it with thy feete, as a garden of hearbes.
{11:11} But the lande whyther ye go ouer to possesse it, is a lande that hath hylles and valleys, and drinketh water of the rayne of heauen.
{11:12} This lande doth the Lorde thy God care for, and the eyes of the Lorde thy God are alwayes vpon it, from the beginning of the yere, vnto the ende of the yere.
{11:13} If you shall hearken therefore vnto my commaundementes which I commaunde you this day, that ye loue the Lorde your God, and serue hym with all your heart, and with all your soule:
{11:14} I also wyll geue rayne vnto your lande in due season, the first rayne and the latter, that thou mayest gather in thy corne, thy wine, and thyne oyle.
{11:15} And I will sende grasse in thy fieldes for thy cattel, that thou mayest eate and fyll thy selfe.
{11:16} But beware that your heart deceaue you not, and ye turne asyde, and serue straunge gods, and worship them:
{11:17} And then the Lorde beyng wroth agaynst you, shut vp the heauen that there be no rayne, and that your lande yelde not her fruite, and lest ye perishe quickly from of the good lande whiche the Lorde geueth you.
{11:18} Therefore shall ye put vp these my wordes in your heart & in your soule, and binde them for a signe vpon your hande, that they may be as a frontlet betweene your eyes.
{11:19} And ye shall teache them your chyldren, that they may talke of them when thou sittest in thyne house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou lyest downe, and when thou risest vp.
{11:20} Yea, and thou shalt wryte them vpon the doore postes of thyne house, and vpon thy gates:
{11:21} That your dayes may be multiplied, and the dayes of your chyldren, in the lande which the Lord sware vnto your fathers to geue them as long as the dayes of heauen last vpon the earth.
{11:22} For if ye kepe all these commaundementes whiche I commaunde you, so that ye do them: namely, that ye loue the Lorde your God, and walke in all his wayes, and cleaue vnto hym:
{11:23} Then wyll the Lord cast out all these nations before you, and ye shalbe the heyres of great nations, and of them that are mightier then your selues.
{11:24} All the places whereon the soles of your feete shall treade, shalbe yours: euen from the wyldernesse, and from Libanon, and fro the riuer Euphrates, euen vnto the vttermost sea shal your coast be.
{11:25} There shall no man be able to stande before you: for the Lord your God shall cast the feare and dread of you vpon all the lande that ye shall treade vpon, as he hath sayde vnto you.
{11:26} Beholde, I set before you this day, a blessing and a curse:
{11:27} A blessing, if ye obay the commaundementes of the Lord your God which I commaunde you this day:
{11:28} And a curse, if ye wyll not obay the commaundemeutes of the Lorde your God, but turne out of the way whiche I commaunde you this day, to go after straunge gods whiche ye haue not knowen.
{11:29} When the Lorde thy God therefore hath brought thee into the lande whyther thou goest to possesse it, thou shalt put the blessing vpon mount Garizim, and the curse vpon mount Ebal.
{11:30} Are not these mountaynes on the other side Iordane, on that part of the way where the sunne goeth downe, in the lande of the Chanaanites, whiche dwell in the playne ouer against Gilgal besyde the groue of Moreh?
{11:31} For ye shall passe ouer Iordane, to go in and possesse the lande whiche the Lorde your God geueth you, and ye shall possesse it, and dwell therein.
{11:32} Take heede therfore that ye do all the commaundementes and lawes whiche I set before you this day.
{12:1} These are the ordinaunces and lawes whiche ye shall obserue and do in the lande, whiche the Lorde God of thy fathers geueth thee to possesse it as long as ye liue vpon the earth.
{12:2} Ye shall destroy all places wherin the nations whiche ye shall possesse serued their gods, vpon hye mountaynes, on hylles, and vnder euery greene tree.
{12:3} You shall ouerthrowe their aulters, and breake their pillers, and burne their groues with fire, and you shall hewe downe the grauen images of the gods that they haue, and bryng the names of them to naught out of that place.
{12:4} Ye shall not do so vnto the Lorde your God:
{12:5} But ye shall seeke the place which the Lorde your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, and there to dwell, and thyther thou shalt come:
{12:6} And thyther ye shal bryng your burnt sacrifices, your offeringes, your tithes, and heaue offeringes of your hande, your vowes, your freewyll offeringes, and the first borne of your kyne, and of your sheepe.
{12:7} And there ye shall eate before the Lorde your God, and ye shall reioyce in all that ye put your hande vnto, both ye and your housholdes, wherin the Lord thy God hath blessed thee.
{12:8} Ye shall not do after all the thinges that we do here this day, euery man what seemeth hym good in his owne eyes.
{12:9} For ye are not yet come to rest, and to the inheritaunce whiche the Lord your God geueth you.
{12:10} But when ye go ouer Iordane, and dwell in the lande whiche the Lorde your God hath geuen you to inherite, and when he hath geuen you rest from al your enemies rounde about, and shal dwell in safetie:
{12:11} Then vnto the place which the Lord your God hath chosen to put his name there, ye shall bryng all that I commaunde you: namely, your burnt sacrifices, your offeringes, your tithes, the heaue offering of your hande, and all your speciall vowes whiche ye vowe vnto the Lorde.
{12:12} And ye shall reioyce before the Lorde your God, ye and your sonnes, and your daughters, your seruauntes, and your maydens, and the Leuite that is within your gates, forasmuche as he hah no part nor inheritauce with you.
{12:13} Take heede that thou offer not thy burnt offeringes in euery place that thou seest:
{12:14} But in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offeringes, and there thou shalt do al that I comaunde thee.
{12:15} Notwithstanding, thou mayest kyll and eate fleshe in all thy cities, whatsoeuer thy soule lusteth after, accordyng to the blessing of the Lorde thy God, whiche he hath geuen thee: both the vncleane and the cleane may eate therof, euen of the Roe bucke, and of the Hart.
{12:16} Only ye shall not eate the blood, but powre it vpon the earth as water.
{12:17} Thou mayest not eate within thy gates the tithe of thy corne, of thy wine, and of thy oyle, and the first borne of thy kine, and of thy sheepe, neither any of thy vowes which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offeringes, or heaue offering of thyne hande:
{12:18} But thou must eate them before the Lorde thy God, in the place whiche the Lorde thy God hath chosen, thou and thy sonne, & thy daughter, thy seruaunt, and thy mayde, and the Lenite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt reioyce before the Lorde thy God, in all that thou puttest thyne hande to.
{12:19} Beware that thou forsake not the Leuite, as long as thou liuest vpon the earth.
{12:20} If when the Lorde thy God shall enlarge thy border as he hath promised thee, thou say, I will eate flesh (because thy soule longeth to eate fleshe) thou mayest eate fleshe whatsoeuer thy soule lusteth.
{12:21} If the place whiche the Lorde thy God hath chosen to put his name there, be to farre from thee, then thou shalt kil of thy oxen and of thy sheepe which the Lord gath geuen thee, as I haue commaunded thee, and thou shalt eate in thyne owne citie whatsoeuer thy soule lusteth.
{12:22} And as the Roe bucke and the Hart is eaten, euen so thou shalt eate them: both the cleane and the vncleane shall eate of them.
{12:23} But be strong, that thou eate not the blood: for the blood is the life, and thou mayest not eate the life with the fleshe.
{12:24} Thou shalt not eate it, but powre it vpon the earth as water.
{12:25} Thou shalt not eate it, that it may go well with thee, and with thy chyldren after thee: But thou shalt do that whiche is ryght in the sight of the Lorde.
{12:26} But thy holy thynges whiche thou hast, and thy vowes, thou shalt take, and come vnto the place whiche the Lorde hath chosen.
{12:27} And thou shalt offer thy burnt offeringes, both fleshe and blood vpon the aulter of the Lorde thy God: and the blood of thyne offeringes shalbe powred out vpon the aulter of the Lord thy God, and thou shalt eate the fleshe.
{12:28} Take heede, & heare all these wordes which I commaunde thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy chyldren after thee for euer, if thou doest that whiche is good and ryght in the sight of the Lorde thy God.
{12:29} When the Lord thy God shall destroy the nations before thee whyther thou goest to possesse them, and thou succeedest in their inheritaunce, and dwellest in their lande:
{12:30} Beware that thou be not taken in a snare after them, after that they be destroyed before thee, and that thou aske not after their gods, saying: Howe do these nations serue their gods? I wyll do so likewise.
{12:31} Nay, thou shalt not do so vnto the Lorde thy God: for all abhominations, and that whiche the Lorde hateth, the same haue they done vnto their gods.
{12:32} For they haue burned both their sonnes and their daughters with fire before their gods. Therefore whatsoeuer I commaunde you, take heede ye do it: and put thou naught therto, nor take ought therefrom.
{13:1} If there aryse among you a prophete or a dreamer of dreames, and geue thee a signe, or a wonder.
{13:2} And that signe or wonder whiche he hath sayde come to passe, and then say: Let vs go after straunge gods (which thou hast not knowen) and let vs serue them:
{13:3} Hearken not thou vnto the wordes of that prophete or dreamer of dreames: For the Lorde thy God proueth you, to knowe whether ye loue the Lorde your God with all your heart and with all your soule.
{13:4} Ye shall walke after the Lorde your God, and feare him, kepe his commaundementes, and hearken vnto his voyce, you shall serue hym, & cleaue vnto hym.
{13:5} And that prophete or dreamer of dreames shal die ( because he hath spoken to turne you away from the Lorde your God whiche brought you out of the lande of Egypt, and deliuered you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out the way which the Lorde thy God commaunded thee to walke in) and therefore thou shalt put the euyll away from thee.
{13:6} If thy brother, the sonne of thy mother, or thine owne sonne, or thy daughter, or the wyfe that lieth in thy bosome, or thy frende whiche is as thyne owne soule vnto thee, entice thee secretely, saying: Let vs go and serue straunge gods (which thou hast not knowen, nor yet thy fathers)
{13:7} And they be any of the gods of the people whiche are rounde about you: whether they be nye vnto thee or farre of fro thee, from the one ende of the earth vnto the other:
{13:8} Thou shalt not consent vnto hym, nor hearken vnto hym, thyne eye shall not pitie hym, neither shalt thou haue compassion on hym, nor kepe hym secrete:
{13:9} But cause him to be slayne: Thine hande shalbe first vpon him to kill him, and then the handes of all the people.
{13:10} And thou shalt stone hym with stones that he dye: because he hath gone about to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God, whiche brought thee out of the lande of Egypt, and from the house of bondage.
{13:11} And all Israel shall heare and feare, and shall do no more any suche wickednesse, as this is among you.
{13:12} If thou shalt heare say in one of thy cities, whiche the Lorde thy God hath geuen thee to dwell in,
{13:13} That certaine men beyng the children of Belial, are gone out fro among you, and haue moued the inhabiters of their citie, saying: let vs go and serue straunge gods, whiche ye haue not knowen:
{13:14} Then thou must seeke, & make searche and enquire diligently: And behold, if it be true, & the thing of a suretie, that such ahbomination is wrought among you:
{13:15} Then thou shalt smyte the dwellers of that citie with the edge of the sworde, and destroy it vtterly, & all that is therin, and euen the very cattell therof, with the edge of the sworde:
{13:16} And gather all the spoyle of it into the middes of the streate therof, and burne with fire both the citie and all the spoyle therof euery whyt for the Lorde thy God: and it shalbe an heape for euer, and shall not be buylt agayne.
{13:17} And there shal cleaue naught of the damned thyng in thyne hande, that the Lorde may turne from the fiercenesse of his wrath, and shew thee mercy, and haue compassion on thee, and multiplie thee, as he hath sworne vnto thy fathers.
{13:18} Therefore shalt thou hearken vnto the voyce of the Lorde thy God, to kepe all his commaundementes whiche I commaunde thee this day, that thou do that whiche is ryght in the eyes of the Lorde thy God.
{14:1} Ye are the childre of the Lord your God: Ye shall not cut your selues, nor make you any baldnes betwene your eyes for ye dead man.
{14:2} For thou art an holye people vnto the Lorde thy God, and the Lorde hath chosen thee to be a seuerall people vnto hym selfe, aboue all the nations that are vpon the earth.
{14:3} Thou shalt eate no maner of abhomination.
{14:4} These are the beastes which ye shall eate of, Oxen, Sheepe, and Goates:
{14:5} Roe, Bucke, and Bugle, wilde Goate, Unicorne, wylde Oxen and Camoise,
{14:6} And all beastes that cleaue the hoofe, and cleaueth the clift into two clawes, and chewe the cud, them ye shall eate.
{14:7} Neuerthelesse, these ye shall not eate of them that chewe cud & of them that deuide and cleaue the hoofe only, the Camel, the Hare, and the Conie: for they chewe the cud, but deuide not the hoofe: therfore they are vncleane vnto you.
{14:8} And also the Swine, though he deuide the hoofe, yet he cheweth not cud, therefore is he vncleane vnto you: ye shall not eate of the fleshe of suche, nor touche the dead carkasse of them.
{14:9} These ye shall eate of all that are in the waters: All that haue finnes and scales shall ye eate:
{14:10} And whatsoeuer hath not finnes and scales, of that ye may not eate, but it is vncleane vnto you.
{14:11} Of all cleane byrdes ye shall eate.
{14:12} But these are they of whiche ye shall not eate: the Egle, the Goshauke, and the Ospray.
{14:13} The Glede, the Kite, and the Uulture after their kinde.
{14:14} And all kinde of Rauens.
{14:15} The Estritch, the Nightcrowe, the Cockowe, and the Sparowehauke after their kinde.
{14:16} The litle Owle, the great Owle, nor the Redshanke.
{14:17} The Pellicane, the Swanne, nor the Cormorant.
{14:18} The Storke, the Heron in his kinde, the Lapwing, the Backe.
{14:19} And let euery creeping thing that fleeth, be vncleane vnto you, and not be eaten of.
{14:20} But of all cleane foules ye may eate.
{14:21} Ye shall eate of nothyng that dyeth alone: But thou shalt geue it vnto the straunger that is in thy citie, that he eate it, or thou mayest sell it vnto a straunger: For thou art an holy people vnto the Lorde thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mothers milke.
{14:22} Thou shalt tythe all the increase of thy seede, that the fielde bringeth foorth yere by yere.
{14:23} And thou shalt eate before the Lorde thy God, in the place whiche he hath chosen & where he hath put his name, the tithe of thy corne, and of thy wine, and of thyne oyle, and the first borne of thy kine, and of thy sheepe: that thou mayest learne to feare the Lorde thy God alwayes.
{14:24} If the way be to long for thee, so that thou art not able to carie it, and if the place be farre from thee, whiche the Lorde thy God hath chosen to set his name there, and the Lorde thy God hath blessed thee:
{14:25} Then shalt thou make it in money, and take the money in thine hande, and go vnto the place which the Lorde thy God shall chose,
{14:26} And thou shalt bestowe that money for whatsoeuer thy soule lusteth after, for oxen and sheepe, wine and strong drinke, and for whatsoeuer thy soule desireth: and thou shalt eate there before the Lorde thy God, and be merie, both thou and thyne housholde.
{14:27} And the Leuite that is within thy gates, shalt thou not forsake, for he hath neither part nor inheritaunce with thee.
{14:28} At the ende of three yeres thou shalt bryng foorth all the tythes of thyne encrease the same yere, and lay it vp within thyne owne gates.
{14:29} And the Leuite whiche hath no part nor inheritaunce with thee, shal come, and the straunger, the fatherlesse, & the widowe whiche are within thy gates shall eate and be filled, that the Lorde thy God may blesse thee in al ye workes of thyne hande whiche thou doest.
{15:1} At the terme of seuen yeres, thou shalt make a freedome.
{15:2} And this is the maner of the freedome: Who so euer lendeth ought with his hande vnto his neighbour, may not aske agayne (that which he hath lent) of his neighbour or of his brother, because it is called the Lordes free yere:
{15:3} Yet of a straunger thou mayst call it home agayne: but he that is thy brother, hym shall thine hande remit.
{15:4} Neuerthelesse, there shalbe no begger among you: for the Lorde shall blesse thee in the lande which the Lorde thy God geueth thee for an inheritaunce:
{15:5} So that thou hearken vnto the voyce of the Lord thy God, to obserue and do all these commaundementes which I commaunde thee this day:
{15:6} For the Lorde thy God hath blessed thee, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt lende vnto many nations, but thou thy selfe shalt not borowe: And thou shalt raigne ouer many nations, and they shall not raigne ouer thee.
{15:7} If one of thy brethren among you be poore within any of thy gates in thy lande which the Lorde thy God geueth thee: thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut to thine hande from thy poore brother:
{15:8} But thou shalt open thine hande vnto hym, and lende hym sufficient for his neede which he hath.
{15:9} Beware that there be not a wicked thought in thine heart, that thou wouldest say, the seuenth yere, the yere of freedome is at hande: and therfore it greeueth thee to loke on thy poore brother, and geuest hym naught, and he then crye vnto the Lorde agaynst thee, and it be sinne vnto thee:
{15:10} Thou shalt geue hym, and let it not greeue thine heart to geue vnto hym: Because that for this thyng the Lorde thy God shall blesse thee in all thy workes, and in all that thou puttest thine hande to.
{15:11} The lande shall neuer be without poore: and therfore I comaunde thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hande vnto thy brother that is needy & poore in thy lande.
{15:12} If thy brother an Hebrue sell hym selfe to thee, or an Hebrue woman, and serue thee sixe yeres, in the seuenth yere thou shalt let hym go free from thee.
{15:13} And when thou sendest hym out free from thee, thou shalt not let hym go away emptie:
{15:14} But shalt geue hym of thy sheepe, of thy corne, and of thy wine, and geue hym of that wherwith the Lorde thy God hath blessed thee.
{15:15} And remember that thou wast a seruaunt in the lande of Egypt, and the Lorde thy God deliuered thee thence: and therfore I commaunde thee this thyng to day.
{15:16} And if he say vnto thee, I wyll not go away from thee: because he loueth thee and thine house, and is well at ease with thee:
{15:17} Then shalt thou take an aule, & nayle his eare to the doore therwith, and let hym be thy seruaunt for euer: And vnto thy mayde seruaunt thou shalt do likewise.
{15:18} And let it not greeue thine eye, when thou lettest him go out free fro thee, for he hath ben worth a double hired seruaunt to thee in his seruice sixe yeres: And the Lord thy God shall blesse thee in all that thou doest.
{15:19} All the first males that come of thy cattell and of thy sheepe, thou shalt halowe vnto the Lorde thy God: Thou shalt do no worke with the first borne bullocke, nor sheare the first gendred of thy sheepe.
{15:20} Thou shalt eate it before the Lorde thy God yere by yere, in the place which the Lorde shall choose, both thou and thy housholde.
{15:21} If there be any blemishe therin: as if it be lame, or blynde, or haue any other euyll fauourednesse, thou shalt not offer it vnto the Lorde thy God:
{15:22} But shalt eate it within thine owne gates, the vncleane and cleane person shal eate it alike, as the Roe & the Hart.
{15:23} Only eate not the blood therof: but powre it vpon the grounde as water.
{16:1} Obserue the moneth of newe corne, that thou mayest offer the Passouer vnto ye Lord thy God: For in the moneth when corne begynneth to rype, the Lorde thy God brought thee out of Egypt by nyght.
{16:2} Thou shalt therfore offer the Passouer vnto the Lorde thy God (of sheepe and oxen) in the place which the Lorde shall choose to put his name there.
{16:3} Thou shalt eate no leauened bread with it: but seuen dayes shalt thou eate vnleauened bread therwith, euen the bread of tribulation (for thou camest out of the lande of Egypt in haste) that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest out of the lande of Egypt, all the dayes of thy lyfe.
{16:4} And there shalbe no leauened bread 'seene in al thy coastes seuen dayes long, neither shall there remayne any thyng of the fleshe which thou offerest the first day at euen vntyll the mornyng.
{16:5} Thou mayest not offer the Passouer within any of thy gates which ye Lorde thy God geueth thee:
{16:6} But in the place which the Lorde thy God shal choose to set his name in, there thou shalt offer the Passouer at euen, about the goyng downe of the sunne, euen in the season that thou camest out of Egypt.
{16:7} And thou shalt roste and eate it in the place which the Lorde thy God hath chosen, and thou shalt returne on the morowe, and go vnto thy tentes.
{16:8} Sixe dayes thou shalt eate sweete bread, and the seuenth day shalbe a solempne assemblie before the Lorde thy God: thou shalt do no worke therin.
{16:9} Seuen weekes shalt thou number vnto thee, and begynne to number the seuen weekes, when thou begynnest to put the sicle to the corne:
{16:10} And kepe the feast of weekes vnto the Lorde thy God, with a free wyll offeryng of thine hande, which thou shalt geue vnto the Lord thy God, according as the Lord thy God hath blessed thee.
{16:11} And thou shalt reioyce before the Lord thy God, thou, and thy sonne, thy daughter, thy seruaunt, and thy mayde, & the Leuite that is within thy gates, and the straunger, the fatherlesse, and the widdowe that are among you, in the place which the Lorde thy God hath chosen, to put his name there.
{16:12} And remember that thou wast a seruaunt in Egypt: and thou shalt obserue and do these ordinaunces.
{16:13} Thou shalt also obserue the feast of tabernacles, seuen dayes after that thou hast gathered in thy corne & thy wine.
{16:14} And thou shalt reioyce in thy feast, thou and thy sonne, thy daughter, thy seruaunt, and thy mayde, the Leuite, the straunger, and the fatherlesse, & the widdowe, that are within thy gates.
{16:15} Seuen dayes shalt thou kepe a solempne feast vnto thy Lorde thy God, in ye place which the Lorde shall choose: for the Lord thy God shal blesse thee in all thy fruites, & in all ye workes of thine handes, therfore shalt thou be glad.
{16:16} Three tymes in the yere shall all thy males appeare before the Lorde thy God, in the place which he shall choose: In the feast of vnleauened bread, in the feast of weekes, and in the feast of tabernacles: And they shal not appeare before the Lorde emptie.
{16:17} Euery man shall geue accordyng to the gift of his hande, & accordyng to the blessyng of the Lorde thy God which he hath geuen thee.
{16:18} Iudges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy cities which the Lorde thy God geueth thee throughout thy tribes, and they shall iudge the people with iust iudgement.
{16:19} Wrest not thou the lawe, nor knowe any person, neither take any rewarde: for giftes do blinde the eyes of the wise, & peruert the wordes of the righteous.
{16:20} That which is iust and ryght shalt thou folowe, that thou mayst lyue, and enioy the lande which the Lorde thy God geueth thee.
{16:21} Thou shalt plant no groue of any trees neare vnto the aulter of the Lord thy God, which thou shalt make thee.
{16:22} Thou shalt set thee vp no piller: which the Lorde thy God hateth.
{17:1} Thou shalt offer vnto the Lorde thy God no oxe nor sheepe wherin is blemishe or any euyll fauourednesse: for that is an abhomination vnto the Lorde thy God.
{17:2} If there be founde among you within any of thy gates which the Lorde thy God geueth thee, man or woman that hath wrought wickednesse in the sight of the Lorde thy God, in transgressyng his couenaunt:
{17:3} And gone and serued straunge gods, and worshipped them, as the sunne or moone, or any of the hoast of heauen, which I haue not commaunded:
{17:4} And it is tolde thee, & thou hast hearde of it, then shalt thou enquire diligently: and if it be true, & the thyng of a suretie that such abhomination is wrought in Israel:
{17:5} Then shalt thou bryng foorth that man or that woman (which haue committed that wicked thyng) vnto the gates, and shalt stone them with stones tyll they dye.
{17:6} At the mouth of two or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death, dye: and at the mouth of one witnesse, let no man dye.
{17:7} The handes of the witnesses shalbe first vpon him, to kyll him, & afterward the handes of all the people: and thou shalt put the wicked away from thee.
{17:8} If there rise a matter to harde for thee in iudgement betweene blood and blood, betweene plea and plea, betweene plague and plague, and the matters come to strife within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee vp vnto the place whiche the Lorde thy God hath chosen,
{17:9} And come vnto the priestes the Leuites, and vnto the iudge that shalbe in those dayes, and aske: and they shall shewe thee the sentence of iudgement.
{17:10} And thou must do accordyng to that which they of that place (which the Lord had chosen) shewe thee, and thou shalt obserue to do accordyng to all that they enfourme thee:
{17:11} Accordyng to the sentence of the lawe which they tell thee, shalt thou do: and bowe not from that which they shewe thee, neither to the right hande nor to the left.
{17:12} And that man that wyll do presumptuously, and wyll not hearken vnto the priest (that standeth there before the Lorde thy God to minister) or vnto the iudge: that man shall dye, and thou shalt put away euyll from Israel.
{17:13} And all the people shall heare, & feare, and shall do no more presumptuously.
{17:14} When thou art come vnto the lande which the Lorde thy God geueth thee, and enioyest it, and dwellest therin, and if thou shalt say, I wyll set a king ouer me, lyke as all the nations that are about me:
{17:15} Then thou shalt make hym king ouer thee whom the Lorde thy God shall choose: Euen one from among thy brethren shalt thou make kyng ouer thee, and thou mayest not set a straunger ouer thee, which is not of thy brethren.
{17:16} But he shall not multiplie horses to hym selfe, nor bryng the people agayne to Egypt to increase the number of horses: forasmuch as the Lorde hath sayde vnto you, ye shall hencefoorth go no more agayne that way.
{17:17} Also he ought not to multiplie wyues to him selfe, lest his heart turne away, neither shall he gather hym siluer and golde to much.
{17:18} And when he is set vpon the seate of his kingdome, he shall write hym out a copie of this lawe in a booke before the priestes the Leuites:
{17:19} And it shalbe with hym, and he ought to reade therin all the dayes of his life, that he may learne to feare the Lorde his God, and to kepe all the wordes of this lawe and these ordinaunces, for to do them:
{17:20} And that his heart arise not aboue his brethren, and that he turne not from the commaundement to the right hand or to the left: but that he may prolong his dayes in his kyngdome, he and his children in the middes of Israel.
{18:1} The priestes of the Leuites, & all the tribe of Leui, must haue no part nor inheritaunce with Israel: but shall eate ye fierie offeringes of the Lorde, and his inheritaunce.
{18:2} Therfore shall they haue no inheritaunce among their brethren: but the Lorde he is their inheritaunce, as he hath sayde vnto them.
{18:3} And the priestes duetie of the people, and of them that offer, whether it be oxe or sheepe, they must geue vnto the priest the shoulder, & the two chekes, and the mawe.
{18:4} The first fruites also of thy corne, wine, and oyle, and the first of the fleece of thy sheepe shalt thou geue hym.
{18:5} For the Lorde thy God hath chosen hym out of all thy tribes, to stande and to minister in the name of the Lorde, he and his sonnes for euer.
{18:6} If a Leuite come out of any of thy cities of all Israel, where he is a soiourner, and come with all the lust of his heart vnto the place which the Lorde hath chosen:
{18:7} He shall minister in the name of the Lorde his God, as his other brethren the Leuites do which remayne there before the Lorde.
{18:8} And they shall haue lyke portions to eate, beside that which commeth of the sale of his patrimonie.
{18:9} When thou art come into the lande which the Lorde thy God geueth thee, thou shalt not learne to do after the abhominations of those nations.
{18:10} Let there not be founde among you any one that maketh his sonne or his daughter to go through the fire, or that vseth witchcraft, or a regarder of tymes, or that regardeth the fleeyng of fowles.
{18:11} Or a sorcerer, or a charmer, or that coucelleth with spirites, or a soothsayer, or that asketh counsayle of the dead.
{18:12} For all that do such thynges, are abhomination vnto the Lorde: and because of these abhominations, the Lorde thy God doth cast them out before thee.
{18:13} Thou shalt be perfect therfore in the sight of the Lorde thy God.
{18:14} For these nations which thou shalt possesse, hearken vnto regarders of tymes, and vnto sorcerers: but the Lord thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.
{18:15} The Lorde thy God wyll stirre vp vnto thee a prophete among you, euen of thy brethren like vnto me, vnto hym ye shall hearken,
{18:16} Accordyng to all that thou desiredst of the Lorde thy God in Horeb in the day of the assemblie, when thou saydest: Let me heare the voyce of my Lorde God no more, nor see this great fire any more, that I dye not.
{18:17} And the Lorde sayde vnto me: They haue well spoken.
{18:18} I wyll raise them vp a prophete from among their brethren lyke vnto thee, and wyll put my wordes in his mouth, and he shall speake vnto them all that I shall commaunde hym.
{18:19} And whosoeuer wyll not hearken vnto my wordes, which he shall speake in my name, I wyll require it of hym.
{18:20} But the prophete which shall presume to speake a worde in my name, which I haue not comaunded hym to speake, or that speaketh in the name of strauge gods, the same prophete shall dye.
{18:21} And if thou say in thine heart: howe shall we knowe the worde which the Lorde hath not spoken?
{18:22} Euen when a prophete speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing folowe not, nor come to passe: that is the thyng which the Lorde hath not spoken, but the prophete hath spoken it presumptuously: Thou shalt not therfore be afrayde of hym.
{19:1} When the Lord thy God hath rooted out the nations whose lande the Lorde thy God geueth thee, and thou succeedest in their inheritaunce, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses:
{19:2} Thou shalt seperate three cities for thee in the middes of the lande which the Lorde thy God geueth thee to possesse it:
{19:3} Thou shalt prepare the way, and deuide the coastes of thy lande which the Lorde thy God geueth thee to inherite, into three partes, that whosoeuer committeth murther, may flee thyther.
{19:4} For this cause must the slayer flee thyther, that he may lyue: Who so kylleth his neighbour ignorauntly, and hated hym not in tyme passed:
{19:5} And whe a man goeth vnto the wood with his neighbour to hewe wood, and as his hande fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut downe the tree, the head slippeth from the helue, and smyteth his neighbour that he dyeth: the same shall flee vnto one of the same cities, and lyue:
{19:6} Lest the auenger of the blood folowe after the slayer whyle his heart is hot, & ouertake hym because the wayes is long, and slay hym, and yet there is no cause worthy of death in hym, in as much as he hated hym not in tyme passed.
{19:7} Wherfore I commaunde thee, saying: Thou shalt appoynt out three cities for thee.
{19:8} And if the Lorde thy God enlarge thy coastes (as he hath sworne vnto thy fathers) and geue thee all the lande which he sayde he woulde geue vnto thy fathers:
{19:9} Thou shalt kepe all these commaundementes to do them, which I commaunde thee this day, that thou loue the Lorde thy God, and walke in his wayes euer: and adde three cities mo for thee beside these three,
{19:10} That innocent blood be not shed in thy lande, which the Lord thy God geueth thee to inherite, and so blood come vpon thee.
{19:11} But and if any man hate his neyghbour, and lay awayte for hym, and ryse agaynst hym, and smyte hym that he die, & then fleeth vnto any of these cities:
{19:12} The elders of his citie shall sende and fetch hym thence, and deliuer hym into the handes of the auenger of blood, that he may dye.
{19:13} Thine eye shall not spare hym, but thou shalt put away the crye of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.
{19:14} Thou shalt not remoue thy neyghbours marke, which they of olde time haue set in thine inheritaunce, that thou shalt inherite in the lande which the Lorde thy God geueth thee to enioy it.
{19:15} One witnesse shall not rise agaynst a man for any maner trespasse, or for any maner sinne, or for any maner fault that he offendeth in: but at the mouth of two witnesses or of three witnesses shall the matter be stablished.
{19:16} If a false witnesse rise vp agaynst a man, to accuse hym of trespasse:
{19:17} Then both the men which stryue together, shall stande before the Lorde, before the priestes and the iudges which shalbe in those dayes:
{19:18} And the iudges shall make diligent inquisition: and if the witnesse be founde false, and that he hath geuen false witnesse agaynst his brother:
{19:19} Then shall ye do vnto hym, as he had thought to do vnto his brother, & thou shalt put euyll away from the middes of thee.
{19:20} And other shall heare, and feare, and shall hencefoorth commit no more any such wickednesse among you.
{19:21} And thine eye shall haue no copassion, but lyfe for lyfe, eye for eye, toothe for toothe, hande for hande, foote for foote.
{20:1} When thou goest out to battayle agaynst thine enemies, & seest horses, and charettes, and people, mo then thou, be not afrayde of them: for the Lorde thy God is with thee, which brought thee out of the lande of Egypt.
{20:2} And when ye are come nye vnto battayle, ye priest shall come foorth to speake vnto the people,
{20:3} And shall say vnto them: Heare O Israel, you are come this day vnto battayle agaynst your enemies, let not your heartes faynt, neither feare, nor be amazed, nor a dread of them:
{20:4} For the Lord your God goeth with you, to fyght for you agaynst your enemies, and to saue you.
{20:5} And let the officers speake vnto the people, saying: If any man haue built a newe house, and haue not dedicate it: let hym go and returne to his house, lest he dye in the battayle, and another man dedicate it.
{20:6} And if any man haue planted a vineyarde, and haue not made it comon: let hym go and returne agayne vnto his house, lest he dye in the battayle, and another make it common,
{20:7} And if any man be betrouthed vnto a wyfe, and haue not taken her: let hym go and returne agayne vnto his house, lest he dye in the battayle, and another man take her.
{20:8} And let the officers speake further vnto the people, and say: If any man feare and be faynt hearted, let hym go & returne vnto his house, lest he make his brothers heart faynt as well as his.
{20:9} And when the officers haue made an ende of speakyng vnto the people, they shall make captaynes of the armie to gouerne the people.
{20:10} When thou commest nye vnto a citie to fyght agaynst it, offer them peace.
{20:11} And if they aunswere thee agayne peaceably, and open vnto thee, then let all the people that is founde therin, be tributaries vnto thee, and serue thee.
{20:12} And if they wyll make no peace with thee, but make warre agaynst thee, thou shalt besiege it.
{20:13} And when the Lorde thy God hath deliuered it into thine handes, thou shalt smyte all the males therof with the edge of the sworde:
{20:14} But the women, and the children, and the cattell, and all that is in the citie, and all the spoyle therof shalt thou take vnto thy selfe, and eate the spoyle of thine enemies, which the Lorde thy God hath geuen thee.
{20:15} Thus shalt thou do vnto all the cities which are a great way of from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.
{20:16} But of the cities of these nations which the Lorde thy God shall geue thee to inherite, thou shalt saue alyue nothyng that breatheth:
{20:17} But shalt destroy them without redemption, namely the Hethites, the Amorites, the Chanaanites, the Pherezites, the Heuites, and the Iebusites, as the Lorde thy God hath commaunded thee:
{20:18} That they teache you not to do after all their abhominations which they haue done vnto their Gods, and so ye shoulde sinne agaynst the Lorde your God.
{20:19} When thou hast besieged a citie long tyme, and made warre agaynst it to take it, destroy not the trees therof, that thou wouldest thrust an axe vnto them: but eate of them, and cut them not downe to further thee in thy siege: for the tree of the fielde is mans life.
{20:20} Only those trees which thou knowest to be vnfruitfull, those shalt thou destroy & cut downe, and make bulworkes agaynst the citie that maketh warre with thee, vntyll thou subdue it.
{21:1} If one be founde slayne in the lande which the Lord thy God geueth thee to possesse it, and lyeth in the fielde, and it is not knowen who hath slayne hym:
{21:2} Then thine elders and thy iudges shal come foorth, and measure vnto the cities that are rounde about hym that is slayne:
{21:3} And let the elders of that citie which is next vnto the slayne man, take out of the droue an heyffer that hath not ben put to labour, nor hath drawen in the yoke:
{21:4} And let the elders of that citie bring the heyffer vnto a harde & rough valley which is neither eared nor sowen, and stryke of the heyffers necke there in the valley:
{21:5} And the priestes the sonnes of Leui (whom the Lord thy God hath chosen to minister, and to blesse in the name of the Lorde) shall come foorth: and by their worde shall all strife and plague be tryed.
{21:6} And all the elders of the citie that come foorth to the slayne man, shall washe their handes ouer the heyffer that is beheaded in the valley,
{21:7} And shall aunswere, and say: Our handes haue not shed this blood, neither haue our eyes seene it.
{21:8} Be mercifull Lorde vnto thy people Israel which thou hast deliuered, and lay no innocent blood vnto thy people of Israels charge. And the blood shalbe forgeuen them.
{21:9} And so shalt thou put innocent blood from thee, when thou shalt haue done that which is ryght in the syght of the Lorde.
{21:10} When thou goest to warre agaynst thine enemies, and the Lorde thy God hath deliuered them into thine handes, & thou hast taken the captiue,
{21:11} And seest among the captiues a beautifull woman, and hast a desire vnto her, that thou wouldest haue her to thy wyfe:
{21:12} Thou shalt bryng her home to thine house, and she shall shaue her head, and shall pare her nayles,
{21:13} And put her rayment that she was taken in, from her, and let her remayne in thine house, and beweepe her father & her mother a moneth long: and after that shalt thou go in vnto her, and mary her, and she shalbe thy wyfe.
{21:14} And if thou haue no fauour vnto her, then let her go whither she lusteth, and sell her not for money, nor make marchaundize of her, because thou hast humbled her.
{21:15} If a man haue two wyues, one beloued, and another hated, and they haue borne hym children, both the loued and also the hated: If the first borne be the sonne of the hated:
{21:16} Then when the tyme commeth that he dealeth his goodes among his children, he may not make the sonne of the beloued first borne, before the sonne of the hated, which is in deede the first borne:
{21:17} But he shall knowe the sonne of the hated for the first borne, and geue hym dowble portion of all that he hath: For he is the first of his strength, and to hym belongeth the ryght of the first borne.
{21:18} If any man haue a sonne that is stubburne and disobedient, that he wyll not hearken vnto the voyce of his father and voyce of his mother, and they haue chastened hym, and he woulde not hearken vnto them:
{21:19} Then shall his father and his mother take hym, and bryng hym out vnto the elders of that citie, and vnto the gate of that same place,
{21:20} And say vnto the elders of the citie: This our sonne is stubburne and disobedient, and wyll not hearken vnto our voyce, he is a rioter & a drunkarde.
{21:21} And all the men of that citie shall stone hym with stones vnto death: And thou shalt put euyll away from thee, and all Israel shall heare, and feare.
{21:22} If a man haue committed a trespasse worthy of death, and is put to death for it, and thou hangest hym on tree.
{21:23} His body shall not remayne all nyght vpon the tree, but thou shalt bury hym the same day, for the curse of God is on hym that is hanged: Defile not thou thy lande which the Lorde thy God geueth thee to inherite.
{22:1} Thou shalt not see thy brothers oxe or sheepe go astray, and withdrawe thy selfe from them: but shalt bryng them agayne vnto thy brother.
{22:2} And if thy brother be not nye vnto thee, or if thou knowe hym not, then bryng it vnto thine owne house, and it shall remayne with thee vntyll thy brother aske after them, and then deliuer hym them agayne.
{22:3} In lyke maner shalt thou do with his asse, and so shalt thou do with his rayment: and with all lost thynges of thy brother, which he hath lost and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise, and thou mayest not hide it from them.
{22:4} Thou shalt not see thy brothers asse or oxe fall downe by the way, and withdrawe thy selfe from them: but shalt helpe hym to heaue them vp againe.
{22:5} The woman shall not weare that whiche parteyneth vnto the man, neither shall a man put on womans rayment: For all that do so, are abhomination vnto the Lorde thy God.
{22:6} If thou chaunce vpon a birdes nest by the way, in whatsoeuer tree it be, or on the grounde, whether they be young or egges, and the damme sittyng vpon the young, or on the egges: thou shalt not take the damme with the young:
{22:7} But shalt in any wyse let the damme go, & take the young to thee, that thou mayest prosper, and prolong thy dayes.
{22:8} When thou buyldest a newe house, thou shalt make a battlement on the roofe, that thou lade not blood vpon thyne house if any man fal from thence.
{22:9} Thou shalt not sowe thy vineyarde with diuers seedes: lest the fruite of the seede which thou hast sowen, and the fruite of thy vineyarde, be defyled.
{22:10} Thou shalt not plowe with an oxe and an asse together.
{22:11} Thou shalt not weare a garment made of wool and linnen together.
{22:12} Thou shalt not make thee gardes vppon the foure quarters of thy vesture wherewith thou couerest thy selfe.
{22:13} If a man take a wyfe, and when he hath lyen with her, hate her,
{22:14} And lay shamefull thynges vnto her charge, and bryng vp an euyll name vpon her, and say, I toke this wyfe, and when I came to her I founde her not a mayde:
{22:15} Then shall the father of the damsell & the mother, bryng foorth the tokens of the damsels virginitie vnto the elders of the citie in the gate,
{22:16} And the damsels father shall say vnto the elders: I gaue my daughter vnto this man to wyfe, and he hateth her,
{22:17} And lo, he layeth shamefull thynges vnto her charge, saying, I founde not thy daughter a mayde: and yet these are the tokens of my daughters virginitie. And they shall spreade the vesture before the elders of the citie.
{22:18} And the elders of that citie shall take that man, and chastise hym,
{22:19} And mearse hym in an hundred sides of syluer, and geue them vnto the father of the damsell, because he hath brought vp an euyl name vpon a mayde of Israel: And she shalbe his wyfe, and he may not put her away all his dayes.
{22:20} But and yf the thyng be of a suretie that the damsell be not founde a virgin:
{22:21} They shall bryng the damsell to the doore of her fathers house, and the men of that citie shall stone her with stones to death, because she hath wrought folly in Israel to play the whore in her fathers house: And so thou shalt put euyl from among you.
{22:22} If a man be founde lying with a woman that hath a wedded husband, they shall both dye, both the man that laye with the wyfe, and also the wyfe: and so thou shalt put away euill from Israel.
{22:23} If a mayde be betrouthed vnto an husbande, and then a man finde her in the towne, and lye with her:
{22:24} Ye shall bring them both out vnto the gates of the same citie, and shall stone them with stones to death: The damsell, because she cryed not beyng in the citie: And the man, because he hath humbled his neighbours wife: and thou shalt put away euyll from thee.
{22:25} But if a man finde a betrouthed damsell in the fielde, and force her, and lye with her: then the man that lay with her, shall dye alone.
{22:26} But vnto the damsell thou shalt do no harme, because there is in the damsell no cause of death: For as when a man ryseth against his neyghbour and slayeth hym: euen so is this matter.
{22:27} For he found her in the fieldes: and the betrouthed damsell cryed, & there was no man to succour her.
{22:28} If a man finde a mayde that is not betrouthed, and take her, and lye with her, and they be founde:
{22:29} Then the man that lay with her, shall geue vnto the damsels father fiftie sicles of siluer, and she shall be his wyfe, because he hath humbled her: and he may not put her away all his dayes.
{22:30} No man shall take his fathers wife, nor vnheale his fathers couering.
{23:1} None that is hurt by burstyng, or hath his priuie members cut of, shal come into the congregation of ye Lord.
{23:2} And a bastarde shall not come into the congregation of the Lorde: no not in the tenth generation he shall not enter into the congregation of the Lorde.
{23:3} The Ammonites and the Moabites shall not come into the congregation of the Lorde, no not in the tenth generation, nor they shall neuer come into the congregation of the Lorde:
{23:4} Because they met you not with bread and water in the way, when ye came out of Egypt, and because they hyred against thee Balaam the sonne of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.
{23:5} Neuerthelesse, the Lorde thy God woulde not hearken vnto Balaam: but the Lord thy God turned the curse to a blessing vnto thee, because the Lord thy God loued thee.
{23:6} Thou shalt not seeke their peace nor wealth all thy dayes, for euer.
{23:7} Thou shalt not abhorre an Edomite, for he is thy brother: neither shalt thou abhorre an Egyptian, because thou wast a straunger in his lande.
{23:8} The children that are begotten of the, shal come into the congregation of the Lorde in the thirde generation.
{23:9} When thou goest out with the hoast against thyne enemies, kepe thee from all wickednesse.
{23:10} If there be among you any man that is vncleane, by the reason of vncleannesse that chaunceth hym by nyght: let him go out of the hoast, and not come in agayne into the hoast.
{23:11} But at euen let hym washe hym selfe with water: and then when the sunne is downe, let hym come into the hoast agayne.
{23:12} Thou shalt haue a place also without the hoast, whyther thou shalt resort to.
{23:13} And thou shalt haue a paddle staffe vpon thy weapon: and when thou wilt ease thy selfe, digge therwith, and turne and couer that which is departed from thee.
{23:14} For the Lorde thy God walketh in the middes of thyne hoast, to ryd thee, and to set thyne enemies before thee: Therfore shall the place of thyne hoast be pure; that he see do vncleane thyng in thee, and so turne him selfe from thee.
{23:15} Thou shalt not deliuer vnto his maister, the seruaunt whiche is escaped from his maister vnto thee.
{23:16} He shall dwell with thee euen among you, in what place he hym selfe liketh best, in one of thy cities where it is good for hym, and thou shalt not vexe hym.
{23:17} There shalbe no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor whore keper of the sonnes of Israel.
{23:18} Thou shalt neither bryng the hyre of a whore, nor the pryce of a dogge into the house of the Lorde thy God, in any maner of bowe: for eue both of them are abhomination vnto the Lord thy God.
{23:19} Thou shalt not hurt thy brother by vsurie of money, nor by vsurie of corne, nor by vsurie of any thyng that he may be hurt withall.
{23:20} Unto a straunger thou mayest lend vpon vsurie, but not vnto thy brother: that the Lord thy God may blesse thee in all that thou settest thyne hande to in the lande whyther thou goest to possesse it.
{23:21} When thou hast vowed a vowe vnto the Lorde thy God, thou shalt not flacke to pay it: For the Lorde thy God wyll surely require it of thee, and it shalbe sinne in thee.
{23:22} If thou shalt leaue bowyng, it shalbe no sinne in thee.
{23:23} But that whiche is once gone out of thy lippes, thou must kepe and do, accordyng as thou hast vowed vnto the Lorde thy God of a freewyll, and as thou hast spoken with thy mouth.
{23:24} When thou commest into thy neighbours vineyarde, thou mayest eate grapes thy belly ful at thine owne pleasure: but thou shalt put none in thy vessell.
{23:25} Euen so, when thou commest into thy neighbours corne, thou mayest plucke the eares with thyne hande: but thou shalt not moue a sickle vnto thy neyghbours corne.
{24:1} When a man hath taken a wife and maried her, if she finde no fauour in his eyes, because he hath spyed some vncleannes in her: then let hym wryte her a byll of deuorcement, and put it in her hande, and sende her out of his house:
{24:2} And when she is departed out of his house, let her go and be another mans wyfe.
{24:3} And if the seconde husbande hate her, let him write her also a letter of deuorcement, and put it in her hande, and sende her out of his house: Or if the seconde man dye whiche toke her to wyfe,
{24:4} Her first man whiche sent her away, may not take her agayne to be his wyfe after that she is defiled: For that is abhomination in the sight of the Lorde, and thou shalt not cause the lande to sinne, whiche the Lorde thy God shall geue thee to inherite.
{24:5} When a man taketh a newe wyfe, he shall not go a warfare, neither shalbe charged with any businesse: but shalbe free at home one yere, and reioyce with his wyfe whiche he hath taken.
{24:6} No man shall take the neather or the vpper mylstone to pledge: for then he shall hurt a mans life.
{24:7} If any man be founde stealing any of his brethren the chyldren of Israel, and abuseth hym, or selleth hym: the thiefe shall dye, and thou shalt put euill away from the middest of thee.
{24:8} Take heede to thy selfe as concerning the plague of leprosie, that thou obserue diligently, and ye shall do according to all that the priestes the Leuites shall teache you: euen as I commaunded them, so ye shall obserue to do.
{24:9} Remember what the Lorde thy God dyd vnto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come out of Egypt.
{24:10} When thou doest lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetche a pledge from thence:
{24:11} But shalt stande without, and the man that borowed it of thee, shall bring the pledge out of the doores vnto thee.
{24:12} Furthermore, if it be a poore body, thou shalt not sleepe with his pledge:
{24:13} But deliuer hym the pledge agayne when the sunne goeth downe, that he may sleepe in his owne raiment, & blesse thee: And it shalbe righteousnes vnto thee before the Lorde thy Lorde.
{24:14} Thou shalt not oppresse an hyred seruaunt that is needie and poore, whether he be of thy brethre, or of the straungers that are in thy lande within thy gates:
{24:15} But shalt geue him his hyre the same day, & let not the sunne go downe theron, for he is needie, and therwith sustayneth his life: lest he crye against thee vnto the Lorde, and it be sinne vnto thee.
{24:16} The fathers shall not be put to death for the chyldren, nor the chyldren for the fathers: but euery man shalbe put to death for his owne sinne.
{24:17} Thou shalt not peruert the ryght of the strauger, nor of the fatherlesse, nor take a wydowes rayment to pledge:
{24:18} But remember that thou wast a seruaunt in Egypt, and howe the Lorde thy God deliuered thee thence: And therfore I commaunde thee to do this thyng.
{24:19} When thou cuttest downe thyne haruest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheafe in the fielde, thou shalt not go agayne to set it: But it shalbe for the straunger, the fatherlesse, and the wydowe: that the Lorde thy God may blesse thee in all the workes of thyne hande.
{24:20} When thou beatest downe thine oliue tree, thou shalt not search ye boughes agayne, to gather vp that thou leftest behinde thee: but it shalbe for the strauger, the fatherlesse, and the wydowe.
{24:21} When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyarde, thou shalt not gather the grapes cleane after thee: but leaue them for the straunger, the fatherlesse, and the wydowe.
{24:22} And remember that thou also wast a seruaunt in the lande of Egypt: & therfore I comaunde thee to do this thing.
{25:1} If there be strife betweene men, they shall come vnto the lawe, and let the Iudges geue sentence betwene them: and iustifie the righteous, & condemne the vngodly.
{25:2} And if any man be vngodly, and worthy of strypes, then let the Iudge cause him to lye downe and to be beaten before his face, accordyng to his trespasse, vnto a certayne number.
{25:3} Fourtie stripes he shall geue hym, and not passe: lest if he shoulde exceede, and beate hym aboue that with many stripes, thy brother should appeare despised and vile before thyne eyes.
{25:4} Thou shalt not moosell the oxe that treadeth out the corne.
{25:5} If brethren dwell together, and one of them dye, and haue no chylde, the wyfe of the dead shall not marry without vnto a straunger: but his kinsman shall go in vnto her, & take her to wife, and occupie the rowme of his kinsman.
{25:6} And the eldest sonne whiche she beareth, shall succeede in the name of his brother whiche is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel.
{25:7} And if the man wyll not take his kinswoman, then let her go vp to the gate vnto the elders, and say: My kinsman refuseth to stirre vp vnto his brother a name in Israel, neither wyll he marry me.
{25:8} Then the elders of his citie shall call hym, and commune with hym: and if he stande and say, I wyll not take her:
{25:9} Then shall his kinswoman come vnto hym in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe of his foote, and spit in his face, and aunswere, and say: So shal it be done vnto that man, that doth not buylde vp his brothers house.
{25:10} And his name shalbe called in Israel, the vnshodhouse.
{25:11} If when men striue together one with another, the wife of the one drawe neare for to ryd her husbande out of the handes of hym that smyteth hym, and put foorth her hande and take hym by the secretes:
{25:12} Thou shalt cut of her hande, and let not thyne eye pitie her.
{25:13} Thou shalt not haue in thy bagge two maner of wayghtes, a great and a small:
{25:14} Neither shalt thou haue in thine house diuers measures, a great and a small.
{25:15} But thou shalt haue a right and iust waight, and a perfect and a iust measure shalt thou haue: that thy dayes may be lengthed in the lande which the Lorde thy God geueth thee.
{25:16} For all that do such thynges, and all that do vnright, are abhomination vnto the Lorde thy God.
{25:17} Remember what Amalech dyd vnto thee by the way, when ye were come out of Egypt.
{25:18} Howe he met thee by the way, and smote the hyndmost of you, all that were feeble and came behynde, when thou wast faynted and weerie, and he feared not God.
{25:19} Therfore when the Lorde thy God hath geuen thee rest from all thine enemies rounde about, in the lande which the Lord thy God geueth thee to inherite and possesse: see that thou put out the remembraunce of Amalech from vnder heauen, and forget not.
{26:1} When thou art come into the lande which the Lord thy God geueth thee to inherite, and hast enioyed it, & dwellest therin:
{26:2} Take of the first of all the fruite of the earth, and bryng it out of the lande that the Lorde thy God geueth thee, and put it in a basket, and go vnto the place whiche the Lorde thy God shall chose to set his name in it.
{26:3} And thou shalt come vnto the priest that shalbe in those dayes, and say vnto hym: I knowledge this day vnto the Lorde thy God, that I am come vnto the countrey whiche the Lorde sware vnto our fathers for to geue vs.
{26:4} And the priest shall take the basket out of thyne hande, and set it downe before the aulter of the Lorde thy God.
{26:5} And thou shalt aunswere and say before the Lorde thy God: The Syrians went about to destroy my father, and he went downe into Egypt, and so soiourned there with a fewe folke, and grewe there vnto a nation great, mightie, and full of people.
{26:6} And the Egyptians vexed vs, and troubled vs, and laded vs with most cruel bondage.
{26:7} And when we cryed vnto the Lorde God of our fathers, the Lorde hearde our voyce, and loked on our aduersitie, labour, and oppression.
{26:8} And the Lorde brought vs out of Egypt, in a mightie hand, and a stretched out arme, and in great terriblenesse, and signes, and wonders.
{26:9} And he hath brought vs into this place, and hath geuen vs this lande that floweth with mylke and hony.
{26:10} And nowe lo, I haue brought the first fruites of the lande whiche thou O Lord hast geuen me: And thou shalt set it before the Lorde thy God, and worship before the Lorde thy God,
{26:11} And reioyce in all the good thynges whiche the Lorde thy God hath geuen vnto thee and vnto thyne house, thou and the Leuite, and the straunger that it among you.
{26:12} When thou hast made an ende of tithing all the tithes of thyne encrease the thirde yere, which is the yere of tithing: thou shalt geue it vnto the Leuite, the straunger, the fatherlesse, and the wydowe, that they may eate within thy gates, and fill them selues:
{26:13} And thou shalt say before the Lord thy God: I haue brought the halowed thinges out of thine house, and haue geuen them vnto the Leuite, the straunger, the fatherlesse, and the wydowe, according to all thy commaundementes whiche thou hast commaunded me: I haue not transgressed thy commaundementes, nor forgotten them.
{26:14} I haue not eaten therof in my mournyng, nor suffred ought to perishe thorowe vnclennesse, nor geuen ought therof for the dead: but haue hearkened vnto the voyce of the Lorde my God, and haue done after all that thou hast commaunded me.
{26:15} Loke downe therfore from thy holy habitation, euen from heauen, and blesse thy people Israel, and the lande which thou hast geuen vs, as thou swarest vnto our fathers a land that floweth with mylke and honye.
{26:16} This day the Lord thy God hath commaunded thee to do these ordinaunces and lawes: kepe thou them, & do them, with all thine heart, and all thy soule.
{26:17} Thou hast set vp the Lord this day to be thy God, & to walke in his wayes, and to kepe his ordinaunces, his commaundementes, and his lawes, and to hearken vnto his voyce.
{26:18} And the Lorde hath set thee vp this day, to be a seuerall people vnto hym, as he hath promised thee, and that thou kepe his commaundementes:
{26:19} And to make thee hye aboue all nations whiche he hath made, in prayse, in name, and honour, and that thou mayest be an holy people vnto the Lord thy God, as he hath sayde.
{27:1} And Moyses with the elders of Israel commaunded the people, saying: Kepe al ye commaundements which I commaunde you this day.
{27:2} And in that day when you shall passe ouer Iordane vnto the lande whiche the Lord thy God geueth thee, thou shalt set thee vp great stones, and plaster them with plaster:
{27:3} And wryte vpon them all the wordes of this lawe when thou art come ouer, because thou art come into the lande whiche the Lord thy God geueth thee, a lande that floweth with mylke and honie, as the Lorde God of thy fathers hath promised thee.
{27:4} Therfore when ye be come ouer Iordane, ye shal set vp these stones which I commaunde you this day in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster.
{27:5} And there shalt thou buylde vnto the Lorde thy God an aulter of stones, and lift vp no iron vpon them.
{27:6} Thou shalt make the aulter of the Lorde thy God of whole stones, and offer burnt offeringes thereon vnto the Lorde thy God.
{27:7} And thou shalt offer peace offeringes, and shalt eate there, and reioyce before the Lorde thy God.
{27:8} And thou shalt wryte vpon the stones all the wordes of this lawe, manifestly and well.
{27:9} And Moyses and the priestes the Leuites spake vnto all Israel, saying: Take heede and heare O Israel, this day thou art become the people of the Lorde thy God.
{27:10} Thou shalt hearken therfore vnto the voyce of the Lorde thy God, and do his commaundementes, and his ordinaunces which I commaunde thee this day.
{27:11} And Moyses charged the people the same day, saying:
{27:12} These shall stande vpon mount Garizim to blesse the people, when ye are come ouer Iordane, Simeon, Leui, Iuda, Isachar, Ioseph, & Beniamin.
{27:13} And these shall stande vpon mount Ebal to curse, Ruben, Gad, Aser, Zabulon, Dan, Nephthali.
{27:14} And the Leuites shall aunswere and say vnto all the men of Israel with a loude voyce:
{27:15} Cursed be the man that maketh any carued or moulten image, an abhomination vnto the Lorde, the worke of the handes of the craftesman, and putteth it in a secrete place: and all the people shall aunswere and say, Amen.
{27:16} Cursed be he that curseth his father and his mother: and all the people shall say, Amen.
{27:17} Cursed be he that remoueth his neighbours marke: and all the people shall say, Amen.
{27:18} Cursed be he that maketh the blynde to go out of his way: and all the people shall say, Amen.
{27:19} Cursed be he that hindreth the ryght of the straunger, fatherlesse, and widdowe: & all the people shall say, Amen.
{27:20} Cursed be he that lyeth with his fathers wyfe, and vnhealeth his fathers couering: and all the people shall say, Amen.
{27:21} Cursed be he yt lieth with any maner of beast: & all the people shal say, Amen.
{27:22} Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or ye daughter of his mother: and al the people shal say, Amen.
{27:23} Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in lawe: and al the people shall say, Amen.
{27:24} Cursed be he that smyteth his neighbour secretly: and all the people shall say, Amen.
{27:25} Cursed be he that taketh a rewarde to slay the soule of innocent blood, and all the people shall say, Amen.
{27:26} Cursed be he that continueth not in all the wordes of this lawe to do them, and all the people shall say, Amen.
{28:1} If thou shalt hearken diligently vnto the voyce of the Lord thy God, and obserue and do all his commaudementes which I commaunde thee this day: the Lorde wyll set thee on hye aboue all nations of the earth.
{28:2} And all these blessinges shall come on thee and ouertake thee, if thou shalt hearken vnto the voyce of the Lord thy God.
{28:3} Blessed shalt thou be in the citie, and blessed in the fielde
{28:4} Blessed shalbe the fruite of thy body, and the fruite of thy grounde, and the fruite of thy cattell, the increase of thy kine, and the flockes of thy sheepe.
{28:5} Blessed shalbe thy basket & thy store.
{28:6} Blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out, & blessed when thou commest in.
{28:7} The Lord shall geue ouer thyne enemies that ryse agaynst thee, that they may fall before thy face: They shall come out against thee one way, and flee before thee seuen wayes.
{28:8} The Lord shall commaunde the blessing vpon thee in thy storehouses, and in all that thou settest thyne hande to, and wyll blesse thee in the lande whiche the Lorde thy God geueth thee.
{28:9} The Lorde shall make thee an holy people vnto him self, as he hath sworne vnto thee: if thou shalt kepe the commaundementes of the Lorde thy God, and walke in his wayes.
{28:10} And all nations of the earth shall see that the name of the Lorde is called vpon ouer thee, and they shalbe afraide of thee.
{28:11} And the Lord shall make thee plenteous in goodes, in the fruite of thy body, in the fruite of thy cattell, & in the fruite of thy grounde, in the lande whiche the Lorde sware vnto thy fathers to geue thee.
{28:12} The Lorde shall open vnto thee his good treasure, euen the heauen to geue rayne vnto thy land in due season, & to blesse all thy labours of thy hande: And thou shalt lende vnto many nations, but shalt not borowe thy selfe.
{28:13} And the Lorde shall make thee chiefest, and not the lowest, and thou shalt be aboue only, and not beneath: if that thou hearken vnto the commaundementes of the Lorde thy God which I commaunde thee this day, to kepe and to do them:
{28:14} And see that thou bow not aside from any of these wordes whiche I commaund thee this day, either to the right hande or to the left, that thou wouldest go after straunge gods to serue them.
{28:15} But and if thou wilt not hearken vnto the voyce of the Lorde thy God, to kepe and to do all his commaundementes and his ordinaunces whiche I commaunde thee this day, all these curses shal come vpon thee and ouertake thee.
{28:16} Cursed shalt thou be in the citie, and cursed in the fielde.
{28:17} Cursed shalbe thy basket & thy store.
{28:18} Cursed shalbe the fruite of thy body, and the fruite of thy lande, and the increase of thy kine, and the flockes of thy sheepe.
{28:19} Cursed shalt thou be when thou goest in, and cursed when thou goest out.
{28:20} The Lorde shal sende vpon thee cursing, destruction, and rebuke, in all that thou settest thine hand to and that thou doest, vntyll he destroy thee, and bryng thee to naught quickly, because of the wickednesse of thyne inuentions, and because thou hast forsaken me.
{28:21} The Lorde shall make the pestilence cleaue vnto thee, vntyll he haue consumed thee from of the lande whyther thou goest to enioy it.
{28:22} The Lorde shall smyte thee with swelling, with feuers, heate, burnyng, and with the sworde, with blasting and mildeawe: and they shall folowe thee vntyll thou perishe.
{28:23} And the heauen that is ouer thy head shalbe brasse, and the earth that is vnder thee, iron.
{28:24} The Lorde shall turne the rayne of the lande vnto powder and dust, euen from heaue shal they come downe vpon thee, vntill thou be brought to naught.
{28:25} And the Lorde shall cause thee to fall before thine enemies: Thou shalt come out one way agaynst them, and flee seuen wayes before them, & shalbe scattered among al the kingdomes of ye earth.
{28:26} And thy carkasse shalbe meate vnto all maner foules of the ayre, and vnto the beastes of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.
{28:27} The Lorde wyll smyte thee with the botch of Egypt, and the emarodes, scab, and itche, that thou mayest not be healed therof.
{28:28} And the Lorde shall smyte thee with madnesse, and blyndnesse, and dasing of heart.
{28:29} Thou shalt grope at noone dayes as the blinde gropeth in darknesse, & shal not prosper in thy wayes: Thou shalt be oppressed with wrong, & be poulled euermore, & no man shall succour thee.
{28:30} Thou shalt be betrouthed vnto a wyfe, and another man shall lye with her: Thou shalt buylde an house, and not dwell therein: thou shalt also plant a vineyarde, and shalt not gather the grapes.
{28:31} Thine oxe shalbe slayne before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eate thereof: Thyne asse shalbe violently taken away euen before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee agayne: Thy sheepe shalbe geuen vnto thyne enemies, and no man shall rescue them.
{28:32} Thy sonnes and thy daughters shall be geuen vnto another nation, and thine eyes shall see it, and dase vpon them all the day long: and there shalbe no might in thyne hande.
{28:33} The fruite of thy lande and all thy labours, shall a nation whiche thou knowest not, eate: and thou shalt continuallye suffer violence, and be oppressed alway:
{28:34} So that thou shalt be cleane beside thy self, for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
{28:35} The Lorde shall smyte thee in the knees and legges with a mischeuous botch that can not be healed, euen from the sole of thy foote, vnto the top of thy head.
{28:36} The Lord shall bryng thee and thy kyng whiche thou shalt set ouer thee, vnto a nation whiche neither thou nor thy fathers haue knowen, that there thou mayest serue straunge gods, euen wood and stone.
{28:37} And thou shalt be wondred at, spoken of, and iested at among al nations whyther the Lorde shall carry thee.
{28:38} Thou shalt carry muche seede out into the fielde, and shalt gather but litle in: for the grashoppers shall destroy it.
{28:39} Thou shalt plant a vineyarde and dresse it, but shalt neither drinke of the wine, neither gather the grapes: for the wormes shall eate it.
{28:40} Thou shalt haue oliue trees throughout al thy coastes, but shalt not annoynt thy selfe with the oyle, for thine oliues shall fall downe.
{28:41} Thou shalt beget sonnes and daughters, but shalt not haue them: for they shalbe carryed away captiue.
{28:42} All the trees and fruite of thy lande shall wormes consume.
{28:43} The straunger that is among you, shall clyme aboue thee vp on hye: and thou shalt come downe beneath alowe.
{28:44} He shall lende thee, and thou shalt not lende him: he shalbe the head, and thou shalt be the tayle.
{28:45} Moreouer, all these curses shall come vpon thee, and shall folowe thee, and ouertake thee tyll thou be destroyed: because thou hearkenedst not vnto the voyce of the Lorde thy God to kepe his commaundementes, and his ordinaunces whiche he commaunded thee.
{28:46} And they shalbe vpon thee for signes and wonders, & vpon thy seede for euer.
{28:47} Because thou seruedst not the Lorde thy God with ioyfulnesse, and with a good heart, when thou haddest aboundaunce of all thinges.
{28:48} Therfore shalt thou serue thyne enemie whiche the Lorde shall sende vpon thee, in hunger, and thirst, in nakednes, and in neede of all thyng: and he shall put a yoke of iron vpon thy necke, vntyll he haue brought thee to naught.
{28:49} And the Lorde shall bryng a nation vpon thee from a farre, and from the ende of the worlde, as swyft as an eagle fleeth, a nation whose tongue thou shalt not vnderstande:
{28:50} A nation of a shamelesse and cruell countenaunce, whiche shall not regarde the person of the olde, nor haue compassion on the young:
{28:51} The same shall eate the fruite of thy cattell, and the fruite of thy lande, vntill he haue destroyed thee: and shall leaue thee neither corne, wyne, nor oyle, neither the encrease of thy kine, nor the flockes of thy sheepe, vntyll he haue brought thee to naught:
{28:52} And he shall kepe thee in, in all the cities, vntyll he haue cast downe thy hye walles and strong holdes, wherin thou trustedst, throughout all the lande: And he shall besiege thee in al thy cities thorowout all the lande whiche the Lorde thy God hath geuen thee.
{28:53} And thou shalt eate the fruite of thine owne body, the fleshe of thy sonnes, and of thy daughters, which the Lord thy God hath geuen thee, in that straitnesse and siege, wherewith thyne enemie shall inclose thee.
{28:54} So that it shall greeue the man (that is tender and exceeding delicate among you) to loke on his brother, and vpon his wyfe that lieth in his bosome, and on the remnaunt of his chyldren which he hath yet left,
{28:55} For feare of geuyng vnto any of them of the fleshe of his chyldren, whom he shall eate: because he hath nothyng left hym in that straitnesse and siege, wherwith thine enemie shall besiege thee in all thy cities.
{28:56} Yea, and the woman that is so tender and delicate, that she dare not aduenture to set the sole of her foote vpon the grounde, for softnesse and tendernesse, shalbe greeued to loke on her husbande that lieth in her bosome, & on her sonne, and on her daughter,
{28:57} And on her afterbyrth that is come out from betweene her feete, and her chyldren whiche she shall beare: For when all thinges lacke, she shall eate them secretly, duryng the siege & straitnesse wherewith thyne enemies shall besiege thee in thy cities.
{28:58} If thou wylt not kepe and do all the wordes of this lawe that are written in this booke, and feare this glorious and fearefull name, The Lorde thy God:
{28:59} The Lord wyll sende vnto thee and thy seede, great plagues, and of long continuaunce, euyll sicknesses, and of long duraunce:
{28:60} Moreouer, he will bryng vpon thee all the diseases of Egypt, and those whiche thou wast afrayde of shall cleaue vnto thee.
{28:61} And all maner sicknesses, and all maner plagues whiche are not written in the booke of this lawe, wyll the Lorde bryng vpon thee, vntyll he bryng thee to naught.
{28:62} And ye shalbe lefte fewe in number, where before ye were as the starres of heauen in multitude: because thou wouldest not hearken vnto the voyce of the Lorde thy God.
{28:63} And it shall come to passe, that as the Lord reioyced ouer you, to do you good, and to multiplie you: euen so he will reioyce ouer you, to destroy you, & to bring you to naught, and ye shalbe wasted from of the lande whyther thou goest to enioy it.
{28:64} And the Lord shal scatter thee among all nations, from the one ende of the worlde vnto the other: and there thou shalt serue straunge gods, whiche thou nor thy fathers haue knowen, euen wood and stone.
{28:65} And among these nations thou shalt finde no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foote haue rest: But the Lorde shal geue thee there an vnquiet heart, and dasing eyes, and sorowe of minde.
{28:66} And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee, and thou shalt feare both day and nyght, and shalt haue none assurannce of thy lyfe.
{28:67} In the morning thou shalt say, would God it were nyght: And at nyght thou shalt say, would God it were mornyng, for feare of thyne heart whiche thou shalt feare, and for the sight of thyne eyes whiche thou shalt see.
{28:68} And the Lorde shall bryng thee into Egypt agayne with shippes by the way whiche I sayde to thee, thou shalt see it no more againe: And there ye shalbe solde vnto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall bye you.
{29:1} These are the wordes of the couenaunt which the Lorde commaunded Moyses to make with the children of Israel in the lande of Moab, besyde the appoyntment which he made with them in Horeb.
{29:2} And Moyses called all Israel, & sayde vnto them: Ye haue seene all that the Lorde did before your eyes in the lande of Egypt, vnto Pharao and vnto all his seruauntes, and vnto all his lande,
{29:3} The great temptations which thine eyes haue seene, those great miracles and wonders:
{29:4} And yet the Lorde hath not geuen you an heart to perceaue, and eyes to see, and eares to heare, vnto this day.
{29:5} And I haue led you fourtie yeres in the wildernesse: and your clothes are not waxed olde vpon you, and thy shoe is not waxed olde vpon thy foote.
{29:6} Ye haue eaten no bread, nor drunke wine or strong drynke: that ye myght knowe howe that I am the Lorde your God.
{29:7} And ye came vnto this place, and Sehon the kyng of Hesbon, and Og the kyng of Basan came out agaynst vs vnto battayle, and we smote them,
{29:8} And toke their lande, and gaue it for an inheritaunce vnto the Rubenites and Gadites, and to the halfe tribe of Manasse.
{29:9} Kepe therfore the wordes of this couenaunt, and do them, that ye may vnderstande all that ye ought to do.
{29:10} Ye stande this day euery one of you before the Lorde your God: your captaynes, your tribes, your elders, your officers, and all the men of Israel:
{29:11} Your childre also, your wiues, and the straunger that is in thine hoast, from the hewer of thy wood, vnto the drawer of thy water:
{29:12} That thou shouldest go into the couenaunt of the Lorde thy God, and into his othe which the Lorde thy God maketh with thee this day:
{29:13} For to make thee a people vnto hym selfe, and that he may be vnto thee a God, as he hath sayde vnto thee, and as he hath sworne vnto thy fathers, Abraham, Isahac, and Iacob.
{29:14} I make not this bonde and this othe with you only:
{29:15} But both with hym that standeth here with vs this day before the Lorde our God, and also with hym that is not here with vs this day.
{29:16} For ye knowe howe we haue dwelt in the lande of Egypt, and howe we came through the myddes of the nations which ye passed by:
{29:17} And ye haue seene their abhominations, and their idols, wood and stone, siluer and golde, which were among them.
{29:18} Lest there be among you man or woman, kinrede or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the Lorde our God, to go and serue the gods of these nations: and lest there be among you some roote that beareth gall and wormewood.
{29:19} So that when he heareth the wordes of this othe, he blesse hym selfe in his heart, saying: I shall haue peace, I wyll walke in the meanyng of myne owne heart: to put the drunken to the thirstie.
{29:20} And so the Lorde wyll not consent to be mercifull vnto hym, but then the wrath of the Lorde and his gelousie shall smoke agaynst that man: and all the curses that are written in this booke shall lyght vpon hym, and the Lorde shal do out his name from vnder heaue.
{29:21} And the Lorde shall seperate hym vnto euyll, out of all the tribes of Israel, accordyng vnto all the curses of the couenaunt that are written in the booke of this lawe.
{29:22} So that the generatio to come of your children that shall ryse vp after you, and the straunger that shall come from a farre lande, shall say, when they see the plagues of that lande, and the diseases wherwith the Lorde hath smitten it:
{29:23} Howe all the lande is burnt vp with brimstone and salt, and that it is neither sowen, nor beareth, nor any grasse groweth therin, lyke as in the place of ye ouerthrowyng of Sodome, Gomor, Adama, and Zeboim, which the Lorde ouerthrewe in his wrath and anger.
{29:24} Euen then shal all nations say: Wherfore hath the Lord done on this fashion vnto this lande? O howe fierse is this great wrath?
{29:25} And men shall say: Because they haue forsaken the couenaunt of the Lorde God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the lande of Egypt.
{29:26} For they went and serued straunge gods, and worshipped them, gods which they knewe not, and which had geuen them nothyng.
{29:27} And the wrath of the Lorde waxed hot agaynst this lande, to bryng vpon it all the curses that are written in this booke.
{29:28} And the Lorde cast them out of their lande in anger, wrath, and great indignation, and cast them into a straunge lande, as this day beareth witnesse.
{29:29} The secretes of the Lorde our God are opened vnto vs, and to our children for euer, that we may do all the wordes of this lawe.
{30:1} When all these wordes are come vpon thee, the blessyng and the curse whiche I haue set before thee, thou shalt turne vnto thine heart, among all the nations whyther the Lorde thy God hath dryuen thee,
{30:2} And come agayne vnto the Lorde thy God, and hearken vnto his voyce in all these thynges that I commaunde thee this day, thou, and thy children, with all thine heart, and all thy soule:
{30:3} And the Lorde thy God wyll turne thy captiuitie and haue compassion vpon thee, and wyll turne and fetche thee agayne from all the nations among which the Lord thy God had scattered thee.
{30:4} Though thou wast cast vnto the extreme partes of heauen: euen from thence wyll the Lorde thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:
{30:5} And the Lorde thy God wyll bryng thee into the lande whiche thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt enioy it: And he wyll shewe thee kindnesse, and multiplie thee aboue thy fathers.
{30:6} And the Lorde thy God wyll circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seede, that thou mayest loue the Lorde thy God, with all thine heart, and all thy soule, that thou mayest lyue.
{30:7} And the Lorde thy God wyll put all these curses vpon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, and that persecute thee.
{30:8} But thou shalt turne, and hearken vnto the voyce of the Lorde, and do all his commaundementes which I commaunde thee this day:
{30:9} (And the Lorde thy God wyll make thee plenteous in al the workes of thine hande, in the fruite of thy body, and in the fruite of thy cattell, and in the fruite of thy lande, for thy wealth: For the Lorde wyll turne agayne and reioyce ouer thee to do thee good, as he reioyced ouer thy fathers.
{30:10} If thou hearken only vnto the voyce of the Lorde thy God, to kepe his commaundementes and his ordinaunces which are written in the booke of this lawe, and if thou turne vnto the Lorde thy God with all thine heart and all thy soule.)
{30:11} For the commaundement which I comaunde thee this day, is not hidden from thee, neither farre of.
{30:12} It is not in heauen, that thou needest to say: Who shall go vp for vs to heauen, and bryng it vnto vs, that we may heare it, and do it?
{30:13} Neither is it beyonde the sea, that thou shouldest say: Who shall go ouer the sea for vs, and bryng it vnto vs, that we may heare it, and do it?
{30:14} But the worde is very nye vnto thee, euen in thy mouth, and in thine heart, that thou do it.
{30:15} Beholde I haue set before thee this day, lyfe and good, death and euyll:
{30:16} For where as I commaunde thee this day, to loue the Lorde thy God, to walke in his wayes, and to kepe his commaundementes, his ordinaunces, and his lawes, yf thou so do thou shalt lyue and multiplie, and the Lorde thy God shall blesse thee in the lande whyther thou goest to possesse it.
{30:17} But and yf thine heart turne away, so that thou wylt not heare, but shalt go astray and worship straunge gods, and serue them:
{30:18} I pronounce vnto you also this day, that ye shall surely perishe, and that ye shall not prolong your dayes vpon the lande whyther thou passest ouer Iordane to go and possesse it.
{30:19} I call heauen and earth to recorde this day agaynst you, that I haue set before you, lyfe and death, blessyng and cursyng: Therfore choose lyfe, that both thou and thy seede may lyue:
{30:20} That thou mayest loue the Lord thy God, and be obedient to his voyce, and cleaue vnto hym: For he is thy life, & the length of thy dayes, that thou mayest dwell vpon the earth, which the Lord sware vnto thy fathers, Abraham, Isahac, and Iacob, to geue them.
{31:1} And Moyses went and spake these wordes vnto all Israel,
{31:2} And sayd vnto them: I am an hundred and twentie yeres olde this day, and can no more go out and in: Also the Lorde hath sayd vnto me, Thou shalt not go ouer this Iordane.
{31:3} The Lorde thy God he wyll go ouer before thee, and he wyll destroy these nations before thee, and thou shalt possesse them: And Iosuah he shall go before thee, as the Lorde hath sayde:
{31:4} And the Lorde shall do vnto them, as he dyd to Sehon and Og kynges of the Amorites, and vnto the lande of them whom he destroyed.
{31:5} And the Lorde shall geue them ouer before your face, that ye may do vnto them accordyng vnto all the comaundementes which I haue comaunded you.
{31:6} Plucke vp your heartes therfore, and be strong, dreade not, nor be afrayde of them: for the Lorde thy God hym selfe doth go with thee, he shall not fayle thee, nor forsake thee.
{31:7} And Moyses called vnto Iosuah, and sayd vnto him in the sight of all Israel: Be strong & of good courage, for thou must go with this people vnto the lande which the Lord hath sworne vnto their fathers to geue them, and thou shalt geue it them to inherite.
{31:8} And the Lorde he doth go before thee, he shalbe with thee, he shall not fayle thee, neither forsake thee: feare not therfore, nor be discomfyted.
{31:9} And Moyses wrote this lawe, and deliuered it vnto the priestes the sonnes of Leui which bare the arke of the testament of the Lorde, and vnto all the elders of Israel.
{31:10} And Moyses comaunded them, saying: Euery seuenth yere, in the solempnitie of the free yere, euen in the feast of tabernacles,
{31:11} When all Israel is come to appeare before the Lorde thy God in the place which he hath chosen: thou shalt reade this lawe before all Israel, that they may heare it.
{31:12} Gather the people together, men, women, and children, and the straunger that is within thy gates, that they may heare, and learne, and feare the Lorde your God, and kepe and obserue all the wordes of this lawe,
{31:13} And that their children which knowe nothyng, may heare, and learne to feare the Lorde your God, as long as ye lyue in the lande whyther ye go ouer Iordane to possesse it.
{31:14} And the Lorde sayde vnto Moyses: Beholde, thy dayes are come that thou must dye: Call Iosuah therfore, and stande ye in the tabernacle of the congregatio, that I may geue him a charge. And Moyses and Iosuah went & stood in the tabernacle of the congregation.
{31:15} And the Lorde appeared in the tabernacle, euen in the piller of the cloude: and the piller of the cloude stoode ouer the doore of the tabernacle.
{31:16} And the Lorde sayde vnto Moyses: Beholde, thou shalt sleepe with thy fathers, and this people wyll ryse vp, and go a whoryng after straunge gods of the lande whyther they go, and wyll forsake me, and breake the appoyntmet which I haue made with them.
{31:17} And then my wrath wyll waxe hot against them in that day, & I wil forsake them, & wyll hide my face from them, and they shalbe consumed, and much aduersitie and tribulations shall come vpon them, so that then they wyll say: Are not these troubles come vpon me, because God is not with me?
{31:18} And I also wyll surely hyde away my face in that day, for all the euyls sake which they shall haue wrought, in that they are turned vnto straunge gods.
{31:19} Nowe therfore write ye this song for you, and teache it the children of Israel, and put it in their mouthes, that this song may be my witnesse agaynst the children of Israel.
{31:20} For I wyll bryng them into the lande which I sware vnto their fathers, that floweth with mylke and honye: and they shall eate, and fyll them selues, and waxe fat, and turne vnto strauge gods, and serue them, and blaspheme me, and breake my couenaunt.
{31:21} And when much mischiefe and tribulation is come vpon them, this song shall aunswere them as a witnesse: For it shall not be forgotten out of the mouthes of their seede: for I knowe their imagination, which they go about euen nowe, before I haue brought the into the lande which I sware.
{31:22} Moyses therfore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
{31:23} And he gaue Iosuah the sonne of Nun a charge, and sayde: Be bolde and strong, for thou shalt bryng the children of Israel into the lande which I sware vnto them: & I wil be with thee.
{31:24} And when Moyses had made an ende of writing the wordes of this lawe in a booke, vntyll he had finished them,
{31:25} Moyses commaunded the Luites, which bare the arke of the couenaunt of the Lorde, saying:
{31:26} Take ye the booke of this lawe, and put it in the syde of the arke of the couenaunt of the Lorde your God, that it may be there for a witnesse agaynst thee.
{31:27} For I knowe thy rebellion and thy stiffe necke: whyle I am yet alyue with you this day, ye haue ben disobedient vnto the Lorde, and howe much more after my death?
{31:28} Gather vnto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speake these wordes in their eares, and call heauen and earth to recorde against them.
{31:29} For I am sure, that after my death ye will vtterly be corrupt, and turne from the way which I haue commaunded you: and tribulation wyll come vpon you in the latter dayes, because ye shall haue wrought wickednesse in the syght of the Lorde, to prouoke hym through the workes of your handes.
{31:30} And Moyses spake in the eares of all the congregation of Israel the wordes of this song, vntyll he had ended them.
{32:1} Heare O ye heauens, and I shal speake, and let the earth heare the wordes of my mouth.
{32:2} My doctrine shal drop as doth the rayne: and my speache shall flowe as doth the deawe, as the shoure vpon the hearbes, and as the droppes vpon the grasse.
{32:3} For I wyll publishe the name of the Lord: Ascribe ye honour vnto our God.
{32:4} Perfect is the worke of the most mightie God, for all his wayes are iudgement: He is a God of trueth, without wickednesse, righteous and iust is he.
{32:5} Frowardly haue they done agaynst hym by their vices, not beyng his owne children, but a wicked and frowarde generation.
{32:6} Do ye so rewarde the Lord, O foolishe nation and vnwise? Is not he thy father that hath bought thee? Hath he nat made thee, and ordeyned thee?
{32:7} Remember the dayes of the worlde that is past, consider the yeres of so many generations: Aske thy father, and he wyll shewe thee, thy elders, and they wyll tell thee.
{32:8} When the most hyest deuided to the nations their inheritaunce, and when he seperated the sonnes of Adam, he put the borders of the nations accordyng to the number of the children of Israel:
{32:9} For the Lordes part is his people, and Iacob is the portion of his inheritauce.
{32:10} He founde hym in a desert lande, in a voyde grounde, and in a roaryng wildernesse: He led hym about, he gaue hym vnderstandyng, and kept hym as the apple of his eye.
{32:11} As an Egle that stirreth vp her nest, and flittereth ouer her young, & spreadeth her wynges, taketh them, and beareth them on her wynges:
{32:12} The Lorde alone was his guyde, and there was no straunge god with hym.
{32:13} He caryed hym vp to the hygh places of the earth, that he myght eate the encrease of the fieldes: And he fed hym with honye out of the rocke, and with oyle out of the most harde stone:
{32:14} With butter of kine, and mylke of the sheepe, with fat of the lambes, and fat of rammes and hee goates, with the fat of the most plenteous wheate, and that thou myghtest drynke the most pure blood of the grape.
{32:15} But he that shoulde haue ben vpright, when he waxed fat, spurned with his heele: Thou art well fed, thou art growen thicke, thou art euen laden with fatnesse: And he forsoke God his maker, and regarded not the God of his saluation.
{32:16} They prouoked hym to anger with straunge gods, euen with abhominations prouoked they hym.
{32:17} They offered vnto deuils, and not to God: euen to gods whom they knewe not, to newe gods that came newly vp, whom their fathers feared not.
{32:18} Of God that begat thee thou art vnmyndfull, and hast forgotten God that made thee.
{32:19} The Lorde therfore sawe it, and was angry: because of the prouokyng of his sonnes and his daughters.
{32:20} And he sayde: I wyll hyde my face from them, and wil see what their ende shalbe: For they are a very frowarde generation, childre in whom is no faith.
{32:21} They haue angred me with that which is no god, and prouoked me with their vanities: And I also wyll prouoke them with those whiche are no people, I wyll anger them with a foolishe nation.
{32:22} For fire is kindled in my wrath, and burneth vnto the bottome of hell, and hath consumed the earth with her increase, and set a fire the botomes of the mountaynes.
{32:23} I wyll heape mischiefes vpon them, & wyll destroy them with mine arrowes.
{32:24} They shalbe burnt with hunger, and consumed with heate, and with bitter destruction: I wyll also sende the teeth of beastes vpon them, with the furiousnesse of serpentes in the dust.
{32:25} Withoutforth shall the sworde robbe them of their children, and within in the chamber feare: both young men & young women, and the suckelynges, with the men of gray heades.
{32:26} I haue sayde, I wyll scatter them abrode, and make the remembraunce of them to ceasse from among men:
{32:27} Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemie, lest their aduersaries should vtterly withdrawe the selues, and lest they shoulde say: our hye hande hath done all this, and not the Lorde.
{32:28} For it is a nation voyde of counsayle, neither is there any vnderstandyng in them.
{32:29} O that they were wyse, and vnderstoode this, that they woulde consider their latter ende.
{32:30} Howe shoulde one chase a thousande, & two put ten thousand to flyght, except their maker had solde them, and except the Lorde had shut them vp?
{32:31} For their god is not as our God: our enemies also them selues are iudges.
{32:32} For their vine is of the vineyarde of Sodome, & of the fieldes of Gomorra: their grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters be bitter.
{32:33} Their vine is the poyson of dragons, and the cruell gall of aspes.
{32:34} Is not this layde in store with me, and sealed vp among my treasures?
{32:35} Uengeaunce is myne, and I wyll rewarde, their feete shall slyde in due tyme: For the day of their destruction is at hande, and the thynges that shall come vpon them, make haste.
{32:36} For the Lord shal iudge his people, and haue compassion on his seruautes, when he seeth that their power is gone, and that they be in a maner shut vp, or brought to naught and forsaken.
{32:37} And he shall say: Where are their gods, their god in whom they trusted?
{32:38} The fat of whose sacrifices they dyd eate, & dranke the wine of their drinke offerynges: let them ryse vp, and helpe you, and be your protection.
{32:39} See nowe howe that I, I am God, and there is none but I: I kyll, and wyll make alyue: I wounde, and wyll heale, neither is there any that can delyuer out of my hande.
{32:40} For I wyll lift vp myne hande to heauen, and wyll say: I lyue euer.
{32:41} If I whet the edge of my sworde, and mine hande take holde to do iustice, I wyl recompence vengeaunce on mine enemies, and wyll rewarde them that hate me.
{32:42} I wyll make myne arrowes drunke with blood, and my sworde shal deuour fleshe, & that for the blood of the slayne, and for their captiuitie, sence the begynnyng of the wrath of the enemie.
{32:43} Prayse ye heathen his people, for he wyll auenge the blood of his seruautes, and will auenge him of his aduersaries, and wyll be mercifull vnto his lande, and to his people.
{32:44} And Moyses came and spake all the wordes of this song in the eares of the people, he & Iosuah the sonne of Nun.
{32:45} And Moyses spake all these wordes vnto the ende, to al the people of Israel,
{32:46} And sayde vnto them: Set your heartes vnto all the wordes which I testifie vnto you this day, and ye shall commaunde them vnto your children, that they may obserue and do all the wordes of this lawe.
{32:47} And let it not be a vayne worde vnto you: for in it is your lyfe, and through this worde ye shall prolong your dayes in the lande whyther ye go ouer Iordane to possesse it.
{32:48} And the Lorde spake vnto Moyses the same day, saying:
{32:49} Get thee vp into this mountayne Abarim, vnto mount Nebo, which is in the lande of Moab, ouer agaynst Iericho, and beholde the lande of Chanaan which I geue vnto the children of Israel to possesse:
{32:50} And dye in the mount whiche thou goest vnto, and thou shalt be gathered vnto thy people, as Aaron thy brother dyed in mount Hor, and was gathered vnto his people:
{32:51} Because ye trespassed agaynst me among the children of Israel at the waters of stryfe at Cades in the wildernesse of Zin: for ye sanctified me not among the children of Israel.
{32:52} Thou shalt therfore see the lande before thee, and shalt not go thyther vnto the lande which I geue the children of Israel.
{33:1} This is the blessyng wherwith Moyses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death, and sayde:
{33:2} The Lorde came from Sinai, and rose vp from Seir vnto them, and appeared from mount Pharan, & he came with ten thousande of saintes, and in his ryght hand a lawe of fire for them.
{33:3} And he loued the people, all his saintes also are in thy handes: They were smitten to go after thy feete, and to receaue of thy wordes.
{33:4} Moyses gaue vs a lawe for an inheritaunce of the congregation of Iacob:
{33:5} And he was in Israel king, when the heades of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.
{33:6} Let Ruben lyue, and not dye, and be fewe in number.
{33:7} This same also happen to Iuda: And he sayde: Heare Lorde the voyce of Iuda, & bryng him vnto his people: his handes shalbe good enough for hym, yf thou helpe hym agaynst his enemies.
{33:8} And vnto Leui he sayde: Thumim and Urim shalbe with thee, and with euery one that is godly in thee: Thou dyddest proue hym also in the temptation, & striuedst with hym at the waters of stryfe.
{33:9} He that hath sayde vnto his father & to his mother (I haue not seene hym) and he that knewe not his brethren, nor knewe his owne children, those are they that haue obserued thy worde, and shall kepe thy couenaunt.
{33:10} They shall teache Iacob thy iudgementes, and Israel thy lawe: They shall put incense before thy nose, and the burnt sacrifice vpon thine aulter.
{33:11} Blesse Lorde his first fruites, and accept the worke of his handes: smyte the loynes of the that rise agaynst him, and of them that hate hym, that they ryse not agayne.
{33:12} And of Beniamin he sayde: The beloued of the Lorde shall dwell in safetie vpon hym, and the Lorde shall couer hym all the day long, and he shall dwell betweene his shoulders.
{33:13} And of Ioseph he sayde: Blessed of the Lorde is his lande for the fruites of heauen, through the deawe & springes that lye beneath,
{33:14} And for the sweete fruites of the increase of the sunne, and rype fruites of the moone:
{33:15} For the first fruites of the principall mountaynes, and for the fruites that the hylles bryng foorth for euer:
{33:16} And for the fuites of the earth, and fulnesse therof: and for the good wyll of hym that dwelt in the bushe, shall the blessing come vpon the head of Ioseph, and vpon the toppe of the head of hym that was seperated from among his brethren.
{33:17} His first borne oxe hath beautie, and his hornes are as the hornes of an vnicorne, and with them he shall trouble the nations together, euen vnto the endes of the worlde: These are also ten thousandes of Ephraim, and the thousandes of Manasses.
{33:18} And vnto Zabulon he sayde: Reioyce Zabulon in thy goyng out, and thou Isachar in thy tentes.
{33:19} They shall call the people vnto the hyll, & there they shall offer offeringes of righteousnesse: For they shall sucke of the aboundaunce of the sea, and of treasure hyd in the sande.
{33:20} And vnto Gad he sayde: Blessed be he that inlarged Gad: he dwelleth as a Lion that catcheth for a pray the arme with the head.
{33:21} He loked to hym selfe at the beginning, because there was a portion of the lawgeuer hid, & he came with the heades of the people, and executed the ryghteousnesse of the Lorde, and his iudgementes with Israel.
{33:22} And vnto Dan he sayde: Dan is a Lions whelpe, he shal leape fro Basan.
{33:23} And vnto Nephthali he sayde: O Nephthali, satisfied with Gods fauour, and full with the blessing of the Lorde, possesse thou the west and the south.
{33:24} And to Aser he sayde: Aser shalbe blessed with children, he shalbe acceptable vnto his brethren, and shall dyp his foote in oyle.
{33:25} Thy shoes shalbe iron and brasse, and thy strength shall continue as long as thou lyuest.
{33:26} There is none lyke vnto the God of Israel, which though he syt vpon the heauen as vpon an horse yet is he thine helper, whose glorie is in the celestiall places.
{33:27} The eternall God is thy refuge, and vnder the armes of the euerlastyng God shalt thou lyue: He shall cast out the enemie before thee, and say, destroy them.
{33:28} Israel then shall dwell in safetie and alone, and the fountayne of Iacob shalbe vpon a lande of corne and wine, and his heauens shall drop the deawe.
{33:29} Happy art thou O Israel, who is like vnto thee O people, that art saued in the Lorde which is the shielde of thy helpe and sworde of thy glorie? Thine enemies haue lost their strength to thee warde, and thou shalt treade vpon their hye places.
{34:1} And Moyses went from the playne of Moab, vp into mount Nebo, and vnto the top of the hyll that is ouer agaynst Iericho: And the Lord shewed hym all the lande of Gilead, euen vnto Dan:
{34:2} And all Nephthali, and the lande of Ephraim, & Manasse, and all the lande of Iuda, euen vnto the vtmost sea:
{34:3} And the south, and the playne of the valley of Iericho, the citie of palme trees euen vnto Zoar.
{34:4} And the Lorde sayd vnto hym: This is the lande which I sware vnto Abraham, Isahac, and Iacob, saying, I wyll geue it vnto thy seede: I haue caused thee also to see it with thine eies, but thou shalt not go ouer thyther.
{34:5} So Moyses the seruaunt of the Lord dyed there in the lande of Moab, accordyng to the worde of the Lorde.
{34:6} And he buryed hym in a valley, in the lande of Moab, ouer agaynst the house of Peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre vnto this day.
{34:7} Moyses was an hundred and twentie yeres olde when he dyed: his eye was not dymme, nor his naturall force abated.
{34:8} And the children of Israel wept for Moyses in the playne of Moab thirtie dayes: And the dayes of weepyng and mournyng for Moyses were ended.
{34:9} And Iosuah the sonne of Nun was ful of the spirite of wisdome, for Moyses had put his handes vpon hym: And the children of Israel were obedient vnto hym, and dyd as the Lorde commaunded Moyses.
{34:10} And there arose not a prophete since in Israel, lyke vnto Moyses whom the Lorde knewe face to face,
{34:11} Accordyng vnto all the miracles and wonders which the Lorde sent hym to do in the lande of Egypt before Pharao and all his seruauntes, and before all his lande,
{34:12} And accordyng to all that mightie hande, and all the great feare which Moyses shewed in the syght of all Israel.
