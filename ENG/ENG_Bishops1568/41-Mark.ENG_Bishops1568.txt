{1:1} The begynnyng of the Gospel of Iesu Christ, the sonne of God.
{1:2} As it hath ben written in the prophetes: Beholde, I sende my messenger before thy face, whiche shall prepare thy waye before thee.
{1:3} A voyce of hym that crieth in the wyldernesse: Prepare ye the waye of the Lorde, and make his pathes strayght.
{1:4} Iohn did baptize in the wyldernesse, and preached the baptisme of repentaunce, for the remission of sinnes.
{1:5} And all the land of Iurie, and they of Hierusalem, went out vnto hym, and were all baptized of hym in the ryuer of Iordane, confessyng their synnes.
{1:6} Iohn was clothed with Camelles heere, and with a girdle of a skynne about his loynes: and he did eate locustes and wylde hony.
{1:7} And preached, saying: He that is stronger then I, commeth after me, whose shoe latchet I am not worthy to stowpe downe, and vnloose.
{1:8} I haue baptized you with water: but he shal baptize you with the holy ghost.
{1:9} And it came to passe in those dayes, that Iesus came fro Nazareth, of Galilee, & was baptized of Iohn in Iordane.
{1:10} And assone as he was come vp out of the water, he sawe heauen open, & the spirite descending vpon him like a doue.
{1:11} And there came a voyce from heauen: Thou art my deare sonne, in whom I am well pleased.
{1:12} And immediatly the spirite driueth hym into wyldernesse.
{1:13} And he was there in the wyldernesse fourtie dayes, and was tempted of Satan, & was with wylde beastes. And the Angels ministred vnto hym.
{1:14} After that Iohn was deliuered to prison Iesus came into Galilee, preachyng the Gospell of the kyngdome of God,
{1:15} And saying: The tyme is come, and the kyngdome of God is at hande: repent, and beleue the Gospell.
{1:16} As he walked by the sea of Galilee, he sawe Simon, and Andrewe his brother, castyng nettes into the sea (for they were fysshers.)
{1:17} And Iesus saide vnto them: Folowe me, and I wyll make you to become fysshers of men.
{1:18} And strayghtway they forsoke their nettes, and folowed hym.
{1:19} And when he had gone a litle further thence, he saw Iames the sonne of Zebedee, and Iohn his brother, which also were in the shippe, mendyng their nettes.
{1:20} And anone he called them: And they lefte their father Zebedee in the shippe with the hired seruauntes, and folowed hym.
{1:21} And they came into Capernaum, & strayghtway, on the Sabboth dayes, he entred into the synagogue, & taught.
{1:22} And they were astonyed at his learnyng: For he taught them, as one that had aucthoritie, & not as the Scribes.
{1:23} And there was in their synagogue, a man vexed with an vncleane spirite, & he cried,
{1:24} Saying: Alas, what haue we to do with thee, thou Iesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy vs? I knowe thee what thou art, euen that holy one of God.
{1:25} And Iesus rebuked hym, saying: holde thy peace, and come out of hym.
{1:26} And when the vncleane spirite hadde torne hym, & cryed with a loude voyce, he came out of hym.
{1:27} And they were all amased, insomuch that they demaunded one of another among them selues, saying: What thing is this? What newe doctrine is this? For with aucthoritie commaunded he the fowle spirites, and they obeyed him.
{1:28} And immediatly his fame spread abrode throughout all the region borderyng on Galilee.
{1:29} And foorthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entred into the house of Simon, and Andrewe, with Iames, and Iohn.
{1:30} But Simons wyues mother lay sicke of a feuer: & anone they tell hym of her.
{1:31} And he came, & toke her by the hande, and lyft her vp: and immediatly the feuer forsoke her, and she ministred vnto them.
{1:32} And at euen, when the sonne was downe, they brought vnto hym all that were diseased, and them that were vexed with deuyls:
{1:33} And all the citie was gathered together at the dore.
{1:34} And he healed many, that were sicke of diuers diseases, and caste out many deuyls: and suffred not the deuyls to speake, because they knewe hym.
{1:35} And in the mornyng, before day, Iesus, when he was rysen vp, departed, and went out into a solitarie place, and there prayed.
{1:36} And Simon, & they that were with hym, folowed after hym:
{1:37} And when they had founde hym, they sayde vnto hym: all men seke for thee.
{1:38} And he saide vnto them: let vs go into the nexte townes, that I may preache there also: for, therfore am I come.
{1:39} And he preached in their synagogues, in all Galilee, and cast the deuyls out.
{1:40} And there came a leper to hym, besechyng him, and knelyng downe to him, and saying vnto hym: If thou wylt, thou canst make me cleane.
{1:41} And Iesus had compassion on hym, and put foorth his hande, touched hym, and sayth vnto hym: I wyll, be thou cleane.
{1:42} And assoone as he had spoken, immediatly the leprosie departed from hym, and he was made cleane.
{1:43} And after he had geuen hym a strayte commaundement, he sent hym away foorthwith.
{1:44} And sayth vnto hym: See thou saye nothing to any man, but get thee hence, shew thy selfe to the priest, and offer for thy clensyng those thinges which Moyses commaunded, for a witnesse vnto them.
{1:45} But he, assoone as he was departed, began to tell many thynges, and to publishe the saying: insomuch, that Iesus could no more openly enter into the citie, but was without in desert places: And they came to him from euery quarter.
{2:1} After a fewe dayes also, he entred into Capernaum agayne, and it was noysed yt he was in the house.
{2:2} And anone many were gathered together, in somuch that nowe there was no rowme to receaue them, no, not so muche as about the dore: and he preached the word vnto them.
{2:3} And they came vnto hym, bryngyng one sicke of the paulsie, whiche was borne of foure men.
{2:4} And when they coulde not come nye vnto hym for prease, they vncouered the roofe of the house that he was in: And whe they had broken vp the roofe, they dyd with cordes let downe the bedde, wherin the sicke of the paulsie lay.
{2:5} When Iesus sawe their fayth, he saide vnto the sicke of the paulsie: Sonne, thy synnes be forgeuen thee.
{2:6} But there were certayne of the scribes syttyng there, and reasonyng in theyr heartes:
{2:7} Why doeth he thus speake blasphemies? Who can forgeue sinnes, but God only?
{2:8} And immediatly, when Iesus perceaued in his spirite, that they so reasoned within them selues, he saith vnto them: why reason ye suche thynges in your heartes?
{2:9} Whether is it easyer to say to the sicke of the paulsie, thy synnes be forgeuen thee: or to say, aryse, take vp thy bedde, and walke?
{2:10} But that ye may know, that the sonne of man hath power in earth to forgeue synnes (He spake vnto the sicke of the paulsie)
{2:11} I saye vnto thee, aryse, and take vp thy bedde, and get thee hence vnto thine house.
{2:12} And immediatly he arose, toke vp the bedde, and went foorth before them all: insomuch that they were all amazed, & glorified God, saying: we neuer sawe it on this fashion.
{2:13} And he went againe vnto the sea: and all the people resorted vnto him, and he taught them.
{2:14} And as Iesus passed bye, he sawe Leui the sonne of Alphee, sittyng at the receipt of custome, and sayde vnto hym: folowe me. And he arose, and folowed hym.
{2:15} And it came to passe, that when Iesus sate at meate in his house, many publicanes and sinners sate also together at meate with Iesus and his disciples: for there were many that folowed him.
{2:16} And when the scribes and pharisees sawe hym eate with publicanes and sinners, they saide vnto his disciples: howe is it that he eateth and drynketh with publicanes and synners?
{2:17} When Iesus hearde that, he saide vnto them: They that be whole, haue no nede of the phisition, but they that are sicke: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentaunce.
{2:18} And the disciples of Iohn, & the Pharisees dyd fast. And they come, and say vnto him: Why do ye disciples of Iohn, and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
{2:19} And Iesus sayde vnto them: Can the chyldren of the brydechaumber fast, whyle the brydegrome is with them? As long as they haue the brydegrome with them, they can not fast.
{2:20} But the dayes wyll come, when the brydegrome shalbe taken awaye from them, and then shall they fast in those dayes.
{2:21} No man also soweth a peece of newe cloth, vnto an olde garment: otherwayes, his newe peece taketh awaye from the olde, and so the rent is made worse.
{2:22} And no man powreth newe wine into olde vessels: els the newe wine doth burst the vessels, and the wine runneth out, and the vessels are marred: But newe wine, must be put into newe vessels.
{2:23} And it came to passe, that he went thorowe the corne fieldes on the Sabboth dayes, and his disciples began by ye way to plucke the eares of corne.
{2:24} And the pharisees sayde vnto hym: Beholde, why do they on the Sabboth dayes, that which is not lawfull?
{2:25} And he sayde vnto them: Haue ye neuer read what Dauid did, when he had nede, and was an hungred, both he, and they that were with hym?
{2:26} Howe he went into the house of God in the dayes of Abiathar the hye prieste, and dyd eate the shewe bread, which is not lawfull to eate, but for the priestes, and gaue also to them which were with hym?
{2:27} And he sayde vnto them: The Sabboth was made for man, and not man for the Sabboth.
{2:28} Therfore is the sonne of man, Lorde also of the Sabboth.
{3:1} And he entred agayne into the synagogue, & a man was there whiche had a wythered hande:
{3:2} And they watched hym, whether he woulde heale hym on the Sabboth daye, that they myght accuse hym.
{3:3} And he saide vnto the man which had the wythered hande: Aryse, and stande in the myddes.
{3:4} And he saide vnto them: Is it lawful to do good on the Sabboth dayes, or to do euyl? to saue lyfe, or to kyll? But they helde their peace.
{3:5} And when he had loked rounde about on them with anger, mournyng for the hardnesse of their heartes, he sayth to the man: stretch foorth thyne hande. And he stretched it out: And his hande was restored, euen as whole as the other.
{3:6} And the pharisees departed, and strayghtway gathered a councell, with the Herodians, agaynst hym, that they myght destroy hym.
{3:7} But Iesus auoyded, with his disciples, to the sea: And a great multitude folowed hym from Galilee, and from Iurie,
{3:8} And from Hierusalem, & from Idumea, and from beyonde Iordane, and they that dwelled about Tyre & Sidon, a great multitude of men: Which, whe they had hearde what thynges he dyd, came vnto hym.
{3:9} And Iesus comaunded his disciples, that a shippe shoulde wayte on hym, because of the people, leste they shoulde thronge hym.
{3:10} For he had healed many: insomuche, that they preassed vpon him for to touch hym, as many as had plagues.
{3:11} And when the vncleane spirites sawe hym, they fell downe before hym, and cryed, saying: Thou art the sonne of God.
{3:12} And he straytely charged them, that they shoulde not make hym knowen.
{3:13} And he went vp into a mountayne, & called vnto him whom he woulde: and they came vnto hym.
{3:14} And he ordeyned twelue, that they shoulde be with him, and that he might sende them foorth to preache,
{3:15} And that they myght haue power to heale sicknesses, and to cast out deuyls.
{3:16} And he gaue vnto Simon to name, Peter.
{3:17} And he called Iames the sonne of Zebedee, and Iohn, Iames brother (and gaue them to name Boanarges, which is to say, the sonnes of thunder.)
{3:18} And Andrewe, and Philip, and Bartholomewe, and Matthewe, and Thomas, and Iames the sonne of Alphee, and Thaddeus, and Simon Cananite,
{3:19} And Iudas Iscariot, which also betrayed hym. And they came into the house:
{3:20} And the people assembled together agayne, so that they had no leysure so much as to eate bread.
{3:21} And when they that belonged vnto hym, hearde of it, they went out to laye handes vpon hym: For they sayde, he is madde.
{3:22} And the scribes whiche came downe from Hierusalem, sayde: He hath Beelzebub, and by the chiefe deuyll, casteth he out deuyls.
{3:23} And he called them vnto hym, & sayde vnto them in parables: Howe can Satan driue out Satan?
{3:24} And yf a realme be deuided agaynst it selfe, that realme can not endure.
{3:25} And yf a house be deuided agaynst it selfe, that house can not continue.
{3:26} And yf Satan make insurrection agaynst him selfe & be deuided, he can not continue, but hath an ende.
{3:27} No man can enter into a strong mans house, and take away his goodes, except he first bynde the strong man, and then spoyle his house.
{3:28} Ueryly I say vnto you, al sinnes shalbe forgeuen vnto the chyldren of men, & blasphemies wherewith so euer they haue blasphemed:
{3:29} But he that speaketh blasphemie agaynst the holy ghoste, hath neuer forgeuenesse, but is in daunger of eternall dampnation.
{3:30} For they sayde: he hath an vncleane spirite.
{3:31} There came also his mother, and his brethren, and stoode without, and sent vnto hym, to call hym out.
{3:32} And the people sate about him, & saide vnto hym: Beholde, thy mother and thy brethren seke for thee without.
{3:33} And he aunswered them, saying: who is my mother, and my brethren?
{3:34} And when he had loked rounde about on his disciples, which sate in compasse about hym, he sayde: Beholde my mother, and my brethren.
{3:35} For whosoeuer doeth the wyl of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
{4:1} And he began agayne to teache by the sea syde: And ther gathered vnto hym much people, so greatly, that he entred into a shippe, and sate in the sea: and all the people was by the sea syde on the shore:
{4:2} And he taught them many thinges by parables, and sayde vnto them in his doctrine.
{4:3} Hearken: Beholde, there went out a sower to sowe:
{4:4} And it fortuned as he sowed, that some fell by the way syde, and the fowles of the ayre came, and deuoured it vp.
{4:5} Some fell on stonie grounde, where it had not muche earth: and immediatly sprange vp, because it had not deapth of earth.
{4:6} But assoone as the sonne was vp, it caught heate: and because it hadde not roote, it wythered away.
{4:7} And some fell among thornes: and the thornes grewe vp, and choked it, and it gaue no fruite.
{4:8} And some fell vpon good grounde, and dyd yelde fruite, that sprang vp, and grewe, and brought foorth, some thirtie folde, and some sixtie folde, and some an hundred folde.
{4:9} And he saide vnto them: He that hath eares to heare, let hym heare.
{4:10} And when he was alone, they that were about hym, with the twelue, asked of hym the parable.
{4:11} And he sayde vnto them: To you it is geuen to knowe the misterie of the kingdome of God: But vnto them that are without, all thynges are done by parables,
{4:12} That when they see, they may see and not discerne: and whe they heare, they may heare and not vnderstande, lest at any tyme, they shoulde turne, and their sinnes shoulde be forgeuen them.
{4:13} And he sayde vnto them: Knowe ye not this parable? And howe then wyll ye knowe all other parables?
{4:14} The sower, soweth the worde.
{4:15} And they that receaued seede by the way side, are those where the worde is sowe: but when they haue hearde, Satan cometh immediatly, and taketh away the word that was sowen in their heartes.
{4:16} And lykewyse they that receaue seede into the stonie grounde, are they, which when they haue hearde the worde, at once receaue it with gladnesse.
{4:17} Yet haue no roote in them selues, and so endure but a tyme: and anone when trouble and persecution aryseth for the wordes sake, immediatlye they are offended.
{4:18} And those be they that receaue seede among thornes: and those I saye are such as heare the worde,
{4:19} And the cares of this worlde, and the deceytfulnesse of ryches, and the lustes of other thynges enter in, and choke the worde, and it is made vnfruitefull.
{4:20} And they whiche receaue seede into good grounde, are suche as heare the worde, and receaue it, so that one corne doth bryng foorth thirtie, some sixtie, some an hundred.
{4:21} And he saide vnto them: Is the candle lyghted to be put vnder a busshell, or vnder the table? And not to be put on a candelsticke?
{4:22} For there is nothing so priuie that shal not be opened: neither hath it ben so secrete, but that it shall come abrode.
{4:23} If any man haue eares to heare, let hym heare.
{4:24} And he sayde vnto them, take heede what ye heare: With what measure ye meate, with the same shall it be measured to you agayne. And vnto you that heare, shall more be geuen.
{4:25} For vnto hym that hath, shall it be geuen: and from hym that hath not, shalbe taken away, euen that which he hath.
{4:26} And he sayde, so is the kyngdome of God: euen as yf a man shoulde sowe seede in the grounde,
{4:27} And shoulde slepe, and ryse vp nyght and day, and the seede shoulde spryng & growe vp, he knoweth not howe.
{4:28} For the earth bringeth foorth fruite of her selfe, first the blade, then the eare, after that, the full corne in the eare.
{4:29} But when the fruite is brought foorth, anone he thrusteth in the sickle, because the haruest is come.
{4:30} And he sayde: Wherevnto shall we lyken the kyngdome of God? Or with what comparyson shall we compare it?
{4:31} It is like a grayne of mustarde seede, whiche when it is sowen in the earth, is lesse then all seedes that be in the earth.
{4:32} When it is sowen, it groweth vp, and is greater then all hearbes, and beareth great braunches, so that the fowles of the ayre may make their nestes vnder the shadowe of it.
{4:33} And with many such parables preached he the worde vnto them, as they were able to heare it.
{4:34} But without parable spake he nothing vnto them. But when they were alone, he expounded all thynges to his disciples.
{4:35} And the same day, when euen was come, he saide vnto them: Let vs passe ouer vnto the other syde.
{4:36} And they left the people, and toke him, euen as he was in the shippe. And there were also with him, other litle shippes.
{4:37} And there arose a great storme of wynde, and the waues dasshed into the shippe, so that it was nowe full.
{4:38} And he was in the sterne a slepe on a pelowe. And they awaked hym, and sayde vnto hym: Maister, carest thou not that we peryshe?
{4:39} And he arose, and rebuked the wynde, and saide vnto the sea, peace and be styll. And the wynde ceassed, & there folowed a great calme.
{4:40} And he sayde vnto them: why are ye so fearefull? Howe is it, that ye haue no fayth?
{4:41} And they feared exceadyngly, and sayde one to another: Who is this? For both wynde and sea obey hym.
{5:1} And they came ouer to the other syde of the sea, into the countrey of the Gadarenites.
{5:2} And when he was come out of the shippe, immediatly there met hym from among the tombes, a man possessed of an vncleane spirite:
{5:3} Which had his abidyng among the tombes: And no man coulde bynde him, no not with cheynes,
{5:4} Because, that when he was often bounde with fetters and cheynes, he plucked the cheynes a sunder, and brake the fetters in peeces: Neither coulde any man tame hym.
{5:5} And alwayes, nyght and day, he was in the mountaynes, and in the tombes, crying, and beatyng hym selfe with stones.
{5:6} But when he had spied Iesus a farre of, he ranne, and worshypped hym,
{5:7} And cried with a loude voyce, & sayde: what haue I to do with thee Iesus thou sonne of the most hyest God? I require thee in the name of God, that thou torment me not.
{5:8} (For he sayde vnto hym: come out of the man thou foule spirite.)
{5:9} And he asked hym, what is thy name? And he aunswered and sayd vnto hym: my name is legion, for we are many.
{5:10} And he prayed hym instantly, that he woulde not sende them away, out of the countrey.
{5:11} But there was there, nye vnto the mountaynes, a great hearde of swyne feedyng.
{5:12} And all the deuyls besought hym, saying: sende vs into the swyne, that we may enter into them.
{5:13} And anone Iesus gaue them leaue. And the vncleane spirites went out, and entred into the swyne: And the hearde ran headlong into the sea, (they were about two thousande,) & were drowned in the sea.
{5:14} And the swyneheardes fled, and tolde it in the citie, and in the countrey. And they went out for to see what was done:
{5:15} And came to Iesus, and sawe hym that was vexed with the fiende, and had the legion, syt, both clothed, and in his right mynde: & they were afraide.
{5:16} And they that sawe it, tolde them, howe it came to passe to hym that was possessed with the deuyll: and also of the swyne.
{5:17} And they beganne to pray hym, that he woulde depart out of their coastes.
{5:18} And when he was come into the shippe, he that had ben possessed with the deuyll, prayed hym, that he myght be with hym.
{5:19} Howebeit, Iesus woulde not suffer hym, but sayde vnto hym: go home to thy frendes, and shewe them howe great thynges the Lorde hath done for thee, and howe he had compassion on thee.
{5:20} And he departed, and beganne to publyshe in the ten cities, howe great thynges Iesus had done for hym: and all men dyd maruayle.
{5:21} And when Iesus was come ouer agayne by shippe, vnto the other syde, much people gathered vnto hym, and he was nye vnto the sea.
{5:22} And beholde, there came one of the rulers of the synagogue, whose name was Iairus: and when he sawe hym, he fell downe at his feete,
{5:23} And besought hym greatly, saying: my young daughter lieth at poynt of death, I pray thee come and lay thy hande on her, that she may be safe, and lyue.
{5:24} And he went with hym, and much people folowed him, and thronged him.
{5:25} And there was a certayne woman, which had ben diseased of an issue of blood twelue yeres,
{5:26} And had suffred many thynges, of many phisitions, and had spent all that she had, and felt none amendemet at all, but rather the worse.
{5:27} When she had hearde of Iesus, she came in the prease behynde hym, and touched his garment.
{5:28} For she sayde: yf I may but touche his clothes, I shalbe whole.
{5:29} And strayghtway the fountayne of her blood was dryed vp: & she felt in her body, that she was healed of ye plague.
{5:30} And Iesus immediatly, knowyng in hym selfe, that vertue proceaded from hym, turned hym about in the prease, and sayde: who touched my clothes?
{5:31} And his disciples sayde vnto hym: thou seest the people thrust thee, & askest thou, who dyd touche me?
{5:32} And he loked rounde about, for to see her that had done this thyng.
{5:33} But the woman, fearyng & tremblyng, knowyng what was done within her, came, and fell downe before hym, and tolde hym all the trueth.
{5:34} And he sayde vnto her: Daughter thy fayth hath saued thee, go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
{5:35} Whyle he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogues house, certayne, which sayde: thy daughter is dead, why diseasest thou the maister any further?
{5:36} Assoone as Iesus hearde the worde that was spoken, he sayde vnto the ruler of the synagogue, be not afrayde, only beleue.
{5:37} And he suffred no man to folowe him, saue Peter, and Iames, and Iohn the brother of Iames.
{5:38} And he came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sawe the tumult, and them that wept & wayled greatly.
{5:39} And went in, and sayde vnto them: why make ye this a doe, and wepe? the damsell is not dead, but slepeth.
{5:40} And they laught hym to scorne: But he put them all out, and taketh the father and the mother of the damsell, and them that were with hym, and entreth in where the damsell laye,
{5:41} And taketh the damsell by the hande, and sayth vnto her. Talitha cumi, which is, yf one do interprete it, damsell (I say vnto thee) aryse.
{5:42} And strayghtway the damsell arose, and walked: For she was of the age of twelue yeres. And they were astonyed out of measure.
{5:43} And he charged them straytly, that no man shoulde knowe of it: and commaunded to geue her meate.
{6:1} And he departed thence, & came into his owne countrey, and his disciples folowed him.
{6:2} And when the sabboth day was come, he beganne to teache in the synagogue: And many that hearde hym, were astonyed, and sayde: from whence hath he these thynges? And what wisdome is this that is geuen vnto hym? and such myghtie workes that are wrought by his handes?
{6:3} Is not this the carpenter Maries sonne, the brother of Iames & Ioses, and of Iuda and Simon? and are not his sisters here with vs? And they were offended at hym.
{6:4} Iesus sayde vnto them, that a prophete is not without honour, but in his owne countrey, and among his owne kynne, and in his owne house.
{6:5} And he coulde there shewe no mightie worke: but layde his handes vpon a fewe sicke folke, and healed them.
{6:6} And he marueyled, because of their vnbeliefe. And he went about by the townes that lay on euery syde, teachyng.
{6:7} And he called the twelue, and beganne to sende them foorth, two and two, and gaue the power ouer vncleane spirites.
{6:8} And commaunded them, that they shoulde take nothyng in their iourney, saue a staffe only: no scrippe, no bread, no money in their purse.
{6:9} But shoulde be shoed with sandales: And that they shoulde not put on two coates.
{6:10} And he sayde vnto them: Whersoeuer ye enter into an house, there abyde tyll ye depart thence.
{6:11} And whosoeuer shall not receaue you nor heare you, when ye depart thence, shake of the dust that is vnder your feet, for a witnesse vnto them: I say veryly vnto you, it shalbe easyer for the Sodomites and the Gomorrheans in the day of iudgement, then for that citie.
{6:12} And they went out, & preached, that men should repent.
{6:13} And they cast out many deuyls, and annoynted many that were sicke, with oyle, and healed them.
{6:14} And king Herode hearde of hym for his name was spread abrode: And he sayde, Iohn Baptist is rysen agayne from the dead, and therefore myghtie workes do shewe foorth them selues in hym.
{6:15} Other saide, it is Elias. Some saide, it is a prophete, or as one of the prophetes.
{6:16} But when Herode hearde of hym, he saide: It is Iohn, whom I beheaded, he is rysen from death agayne.
{6:17} For Herode himselfe had sent foorth, and layde handes vpon Iohn, & bounde hym in pryson, for Herodias sake, his brother Philippes wyfe, because he had maryed her.
{6:18} For Iohn sayde vnto Herode: It is not lawful for thee to haue thy brothers wyfe.
{6:19} Therefore Herodias layde wayte for hym, and woulde haue kylled hym: but she coulde not.
{6:20} For Herode feared Iohn, knowyng that he was a iuste man and an holye, and gaue hym reuerence: and when he hearde hym, he dyd many thynges, and hearde hym gladly.
{6:21} And whe a conuenient day was come, that Herode on his birth daye made a supper to the lordes, hye captaynes, and chiefe estates of Galilee.
{6:22} And when the daughter of the same Herodias came in, and daunced, and pleased Herode, and them that sate at boorde also, the kyng said vnto the damsell: Aske of me what thou wylt, and I wyll geue it thee.
{6:23} And he sware vnto her: Whatsoeuer thou shalt aske of me, I wyll geue it thee, euen vnto the one halfe of my kingdome.
{6:24} And she went foorth, & sayde vnto her mother: What shall I aske? She saide, Iohn Baptistes head.
{6:25} And she came in strayghtwaye, with haste, vnto the kyng, and asked, saying: I wyll, that thou geue me by and by in a charger, the head of Iohn Baptist.
{6:26} And the kyng was sory, howebeit, for his othes sake, & for their sakes whiche sate at supper also, he woulde not caste her of.
{6:27} And immediatlye the kyng sent the hangman, and commaunded his head to be brought in: And he went, and beheaded hym in the pryson,
{6:28} And brought his head in a charger, & gaue it to the damsell, and the damsell gaue it to her mother.
{6:29} And when his disciples hearde of it, they came, and toke vp his body, and layed it in a tombe.
{6:30} And the Apostles gathered themselues together vnto Iesus, and tolde hym all thynges, both what they had done, and what they had taught.
{6:31} And he sayde vnto them: Come ye alone out of the way, into ye wyldernesse, and rest awhyle: For there were many commers and goers, and they had no leysure, so much as to eate.
{6:32} And he wet by shippe out of the way, into a desert place.
{6:33} And the people spyed them, when they departed, and many knewe hym, and ranne a foote thyther, out of all cities, & came thyther before them, and came together vnto hym.
{6:34} And Iesus went out, and sawe much people, and had compassion on them, because they were lyke sheepe, not hauyng a sheepheard: And he began to teache them many thynges.
{6:35} And when the day was nowe farre spent, his disciples came vnto hym, saying: This is a desert place, & nowe the tyme is farre passed:
{6:36} Let them departe, that they may go into the countrey rounde about, and into the townes, and bye them bread: for they haue nothyng to eate.
{6:37} He aunswered and sayde vnto them: geue ye them to eate. And they saide vnto him: Shall we go and bye two hundred penyworth of bread, & geue them to eate?
{6:38} He sayde vnto them: Howe many loaues haue ye, go loke? And when they had searched, they sayde, fyue, and two fisshes.
{6:39} And he commaunded them, to make them all sit downe by companies vpon the greene grasse.
{6:40} And they sate downe, here a rowe, and there a rowe, by hundredes, & by fifties.
{6:41} And when he had take the fiue loaues and the two fisshes, and loked vp to heauen, he blessed, and brake the loaues, & gaue them to his disciples to set before them: and the two fisshes deuided he among them all.
{6:42} And they all did eate, & were satisfied.
{6:43} And they toke vp twelue baskets full, of the fragmentes, & of the fisshes.
{6:44} And they that dyd eate, were about fyue thousande men.
{6:45} And straightway, he constrayned his disciples to go into the shippe, and to go ouer the sea before, vnto Bethsaida, whyle he sent away the people.
{6:46} And assoone as he had sent them away, he departed into a mountayne to pray.
{6:47} And when euen was come, the ship was in the myddes of the sea, and he alone on the lande.
{6:48} And he sawe them troubled in rowyng (for the wynde was contrary vnto them:) And about the fourth watche of the nyght, he came vnto them, walking vppon the sea, and woulde haue passed by them.
{6:49} But when they sawe hym walkyng vpon the sea, they supposed it had ben a spirite, and cryed out.
{6:50} For they all sawe him, & were afraide. And anone he talked with them, & saide vnto them: Be of good cheare, it is I, be not afrayde.
{6:51} And he went vp vnto them into the shippe, and the wynde ceassed, and they were sore amased in themselues beyond measure, and marueyled.
{6:52} For they vnderstoode not the miracle of the loaues, because their heart was hardened.
{6:53} And when they had passed ouer, they came into the lande of Genezareth, and drewe vp into the hauen.
{6:54} And assoone as they were come out of the shippe, straightway they knew him,
{6:55} And ranne foorth throughout all the region rounde about, & began to carry about in beddes those that were sicke, thither, where they heard that he was.
{6:56} And whethersoeuer he entred, into townes, cities, or villages, they layde the sicke folkes in the streates, & prayed him that they myght touche and it were but the hemme of his garment: And as many as touched it, were made whole.
{7:1} And the pharisees came together vnto hym, & certayne of the scribes which came from Hierusalem.
{7:2} And whe they sawe some of his disciples eate bread with common that is to say, with vnwasshen hands, they founde fault.
{7:3} For the pharisees and all the Iewes, except they wasshe their handes oft, eate not, obseruing the traditions of ye elders.
{7:4} And when they come from the market, except they wasshe, they eate not. And many other things there be, which they haue taken vpon them to obserue as the wasshyng of cuppes and pottes, and brasen vessels, and of tables.
{7:5} Then asked hym the pharisees and scribes: Why walke not thy disciples accordyng to the traditio of the elders, but eate bread with vnwasshen handes?
{7:6} He aunswered, and sayde vnto them, that Esaias hath prophesied well of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoreth me with their lippes, but their heart is farre from me.
{7:7} Howebeit, in vayne do they worship me, teachyng doctrines, the commaundementes of men.
{7:8} For ye laye the commaundement of God apart, and obserue the tradition of me: as the wasshing of pottes & cuppes. And many other such like thinges ye do.
{7:9} And he sayde vnto them: Well, ye cast asyde the commaundement of God, to mayntayne your owne tradition.
{7:10} For Moyses sayde, Honor thy father and thy mother: and, who so curseth father or mother, let him dye the death.
{7:11} But ye say, yf a man shall say to father or mother Corban (that is, by the gyft) that is offred of me, thou shalt be helped.
{7:12} And so ye suffer hym no more to do ought for his father or his mother.
{7:13} And make the worde of God of none effect, through your tradition, which ye haue ordeyned. And many such thinges do ye.
{7:14} And when he had called all the people vnto hym, he saide vnto them: Hearken vnto me, euery one of you, and vnderstande.
{7:15} There is nothyng without a man, that can defyle hym, when it entreth into hym: But the thynges whiche proceade out of a man, those are they that defyle the man.
{7:16} If any man haue eares to heare, let hym heare.
{7:17} And when he came into the house, away from the people, his disciples asked hym of the similitude.
{7:18} And he sayde vnto them: Are ye also so without vnderstandyng? Do ye not yet perceaue, that whatsoeuer thing fro without, entreth into a man, it can not defyle hym,
{7:19} Because it entreth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purgyng all meates?
{7:20} And he sayde: That which commeth out of a man, defyleth the man.
{7:21} For from within, euen out of the heart of men, proceade euyll thoughtes, adulterie, fornication, murther,
{7:22} Theft, couetousnes, wickednes, deceit, wantonnes, a wicked eye, blasphemies, pride, foolyshnes.
{7:23} All these euyll thynges come fro within, and defyle a man.
{7:24} And from thence he rose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, & entred into an house, and woulde that no man shoulde haue knowen: but he coulde not be hyd.
{7:25} For a certayne woman, whose young daughter hadde an vncleane spirite, assoone as she hearde of hym, came, & fell at his feete.
{7:26} The woman was a Greke, out of the nation of Syrophenissa: & she besought hym, that he woulde cast out the deuyll from her daughter.
{7:27} But Iesus saide vnto her, let the children first be fedde: For it is not meete to take the chyldrens bread, and to caste it vnto litle dogges.
{7:28} She aunswered, and saide vnto hym, euen so Lorde: neuerthelesse, the litle dogges also eate vnder the table, of the chyldrens crumbes.
{7:29} And he sayde vnto her: For this saying, go thy way, the deuyll is gone out of thy daughter.
{7:30} And when she was come home to her house, she founde that the deuyll was departed, and her daughter lying on the bedde.
{7:31} And he departed agayne from the coastes of Tyre and Sidon, & came vnto the sea of Galilee, through the middes of the coastes of the ten cities.
{7:32} And they brought vnto hym one that was deafe, and had an impediment in his speache: and they prayed him to put his hande vpon hym.
{7:33} And when he had taken hym asyde from the people, he put his fyngers into his cares, and dyd spyt, and touched his tongue,
{7:34} And loked vp to heauen, and syghed, and sayde vnto him Ephphatha, that is to say, be opened.
{7:35} And straightway his eares were opened, and the stryng of his tongue was loosed, and he spake playne.
{7:36} And he commaunded them, that they shoulde tell no man: But the more he forbad them, so much the more a great deale they published it.
{7:37} And were beyonde measure astonyed, saying: He hath done all thynges well, he hath made both the deafe to heare, and the dumbe to speake.
{8:1} In those dayes, when there was a very great company, and had nothyng to eate, Iesus called his disciples to him, & saide vnto them:
{8:2} I haue compassio on the people, because they haue nowe ben with me three dayes, and haue nothyng to eate:
{8:3} And yf I sende them away fastyng to their owne houses, they shall faynt by the way: for diuers of them came fro farre.
{8:4} And his disciples aunswered hym: From whence can a man satisfie these men with bread here in the wildernesse?
{8:5} And he asked the: Howe many loaues haue ye? They sayde, seuen.
{8:6} And he commaunded the people to sit downe on the grounde: And he toke the seuen loaues, and when he had geuen thankes, he brake, and gaue to his disciples, to set before them: And they dyd set them before the people.
{8:7} And they hadde a fewe small fysshes: And when he had blessed, he commaunded them also to be set before them.
{8:8} So they dyd eate, and were suffised: And they toke vp of the broken meate that was left, seuen baskettes full.
{8:9} And they that had eaten, were about foure thousand: And he sent the away.
{8:10} And anone he entred into a shippe, with his disciples, and came into the parties of Dalmanutha.
{8:11} And the Pharisees came foorth, and began to dispute with hym, sekyng of him a signe from heauen, tempting him.
{8:12} And when he had sighed depely in his spirite, he sayth: Why doth this generatio seke a signe? Ueryly I say vnto you, there shall no signe be geue vnto this generation.
{8:13} And he lefte them, and went into the ship agayne, & departed ouer the water.
{8:14} And they had forgotten to take bread with them neither had they in the ship with them more then one loafe.
{8:15} And he charged the, saying: Take heede, beware of the leuen of the pharisees, and of the leuen of Herode.
{8:16} And they reasoned among them selues, saying: We haue no bread.
{8:17} And Iesus knewe it, and sayth vnto them: Why reason ye, because ye haue no bread? Perceaue ye not yet, neither vnderstande? Haue ye your heart yet hardened?
{8:18} Haue ye eyes, and see not? and haue ye eares & heare not? Do ye not remember?
{8:19} When I brake fyue loaues among fyue thousande men, howe many baskettes full of broken meate toke ye vp? They say vnto hym, twelue.
{8:20} When I brake seuen among foure thousande, howe many baskettes of the leauynges of the broken meate toke ye vp? They sayde, seuen.
{8:21} And he sayde vnto them: Howe happeneth it, that ye do not vnderstande?
{8:22} And he came to Bethsaida, & they brought a blynde man vnto hym, and desired hym to touche hym.
{8:23} And he caught the blinde by the hand, and led him out of the towne: and whe he had spyt in his eyes, & put his handes vpon him, he asked him if he saw ought.
{8:24} And he loked vp, & saide, I see men: for I perceiue the walke as they were trees.
{8:25} After that, he put his handes agayne vpon his eyes, & made hym see: And he was restored, & saw euery man clearely.
{8:26} And he sent hym home to his house, saying: neither go into the towne, nor tell it to any in the towne.
{8:27} And Iesus went out, & his disciples, into the townes that long to Cesarea Philippi: And by the way he asked his disciples, saying vnto them: Whom do men say that I am?
{8:28} And they aunswered: Some saye that thou art Iohn Baptist, and some saye, Elias: Agayne, some saye that thou art one of the prophetes.
{8:29} And he sayde vnto them: But whom say ye that I am? Peter aunswereth, & saith vnto him: Thou art very Christe.
{8:30} And he charged them, that they should tell no man of hym.
{8:31} And he began to teache them, howe that the sonne of man must suffer many thynges, & be reproued of the elders, and of the hie priestes, & scribes, and be killed, and after three dayes, aryse agayne.
{8:32} And he spake that saying openly: And Peter toke hym asyde, and began to rebuke hym.
{8:33} But he turned about, and loked on his disciples, and rebuked Peter, saying, go after me Sata: for thou sauerest not the thinges that be of God, but the thinges that be of men.
{8:34} And when he had called the people vnto hym, with his disciples also, he said vnto them: Whosoeuer wyll folow me, let hym forsake hym selfe, and take vp his crosse, and folowe me.
{8:35} For whosoeuer wyll saue his life, shall lose it: But whosoeuer shall lose his life, for my sake & the Gospels, the same shall saue it.
{8:36} For what shall it profite a man, yf he wynne all the worlde, and lose his owne soule?
{8:37} Or what shall a man geue, for a raunsome of his soule?
{8:38} Whosoeuer therfore shalbe ashamed of me, and of my wordes, in this adulterous and synnefull generation: of hym also shall the sonne of man be ashamed, when he commeth in the glorie of his father, with the holy Angels.
{9:1} And he saide vnto them: Ueryly I say vnto you, ther be some of them that stande here, whiche shall not taste of death, tyll they haue seene ye kyngdome of God come, with power.
{9:2} And after sixe dayes, Iesus taketh Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and leadeth them vp into an hye mountayne, out of the way, alone: and he was transfigured before them.
{9:3} And his rayment dyd shyne, & became very whyte, euen as snowe: so whyte, as no fuller can make vpon the earth.
{9:4} And there appeared vnto them Elias, with Moyses: And they talked with Iesu.
{9:5} And Peter aunswered, and sayth to Iesu: Maister, here is good beyng for vs, let vs make also three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moyses, and one for Elias.
{9:6} For he wist not what he saide, for they were afrayde.
{9:7} And there was a cloude that shadowed them: and a voyce came out of the cloude, saying, This is my beloued sonne, heare hym.
{9:8} And sodenly, when they had loked rounde about, they sawe no man, more then Iesus only, with them.
{9:9} And as they came downe from the hyll, he charged them, that they should tell no man those thynges that they had seene, tyll the sonne of man were rysen from the dead agayne.
{9:10} And they kept that saying with them, and demaunded one of another, what the rysing from the dead againe, should meane?
{9:11} And they asked hym, saying: Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?
{9:12} He aunswered, and sayde vnto them: Elias veryly when he commeth firste, restoreth all thynges: And the sonne of man, as it is written of hym, shall suffer many thynges, & be set at naught.
{9:13} But I saye vnto you, that Elias is come, & they haue done vnto him whatsoeuer they would, as it is writte of him.
{9:14} And when he came to his disciples, he sawe much people about them, and the scribes disputyng with them.
{9:15} And strayghtway all the people, whe they behelde hym, were amased, & ran to hym, and saluted hym.
{9:16} And he asked the scribes, what dispute ye with them?
{9:17} And one of the companie aunswered, & sayde: Maister, I haue brought vnto thee my sonne, whiche hath a dumbe spirite:
{9:18} And whensoeuer he taketh hym, he teareth hym, & he fometh, and gnasheth with his teeth, & pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples, that they should cast hym out, and they coulde not.
{9:19} He aunswereth hym, and sayth: O faythlesse nation, howe long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? Bryng hym vnto me.
{9:20} And they brought him vnto him: And when he sawe hym, strayghtway the spirite tare hym: And he fell downe on the grounde, wallowyng and fomyng.
{9:21} And he asketh his father, howe longe it is a go sence this came vnto hym? And he sayde, of a chylde.
{9:22} And oft tymes it hath cast hym into the fire, and into the water, to destroye hym: But yf thou canst do any thyng, haue mercy on vs, and helpe vs.
{9:23} Iesus sayde vnto hym: this thyng yf thou cans beleue, all thynges are possible to hym that beleueth.
{9:24} And strayghtwaye the father of the childe cryed with teares, saying: Lorde I beleue, helpe thou mine vnbeliefe.
{9:25} When Iesus sawe that the people came runnyng together, he rebuked the foule spirite, saying vnto hym: Thou dumbe and deafe spirite, I charge thee come out of hym, and enter no more into hym.
{9:26} And the spirite, when he had cryed and rent him sore, came out of hym: and he was as one that had ben dead, insomuch that many sayde, he is dead.
{9:27} But Iesus caught hym by the hande, and lyft hym vp: and he rose.
{9:28} And whe he was come into the house, his disciples asked hym secretely: Why coulde not we cast hym out?
{9:29} And he saide vnto them: This kynde can come foorth by nothing, but by prayer and fastyng.
{9:30} And they departed thence, and toke their iorney thorowe Galilee: and he would not yt any man should knowe it.
{9:31} For he taught his disciples, and sayde vnto them: The sonne of man, shalbe deliuered into the handes of men, & they shall kyll him: and, after that he is kylled, he shall ryse agayne the thirde day.
{9:32} But they vnderstoode not that saying, and were afrayde to aske hym.
{9:33} And he came to Capernaum: And when he was come into the house, he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among your selues by the way?
{9:34} And they helde their peace: For by the way, they had reasoned among them selues, who shoulde be the chiefest.
{9:35} And when he was set downe, he called the twelue to hym, and sayde vnto them: If any man desire to be first, the same shalbe last of al, & seruaut vnto al.
{9:36} And he toke a young childe, & set him in the myddes of them: and when he had taken hym in his armes, he sayde vnto them.
{9:37} Whosoeuer receaueth any such a young chylde in my name, receaueth me: And whosoeuer receaueth me, receaueth not me, but hym that sent me.
{9:38} Iohn aunswered him, saying: Maister, we sawe one caste out deuylles in thy name, & he foloweth not vs: and we forbad him, because he foloweth vs not.
{9:39} But Iesus sayde, forbyd hym not: For there is no man, whiche, yf he do a miracle in my name, can lyghtly speake euyll of me.
{9:40} For he that is not against vs, is on our part.
{9:41} Whosoeuer shall in my name geue you a cup of colde water to drynke, because ye belong to Christe: veryly I say vnto you, he shall not lose his rewarde.
{9:42} And whosoeuer shall offende one of these litle ones, that beleue in me, it were better for him, if a mylstone were hanged about his necke, and he were cast into the sea.
{9:43} And yf thy hande offende thee, cut it of: It is better for thee to enter into lyfe maymed, then hauyng two handes, to go into hell, into fire that neuer shalbe quenched:
{9:44} Where their worme dyeth not, & the fire goeth not out.
{9:45} And yf thy foote offende thee, cut it of: It is better for thee to go halt into lyfe, then hauyng two feete, to be cast into hell, into fire that neuer shalbe queched:
{9:46} Where their worme dyeth not, and the fire goeth not out.
{9:47} And if thine eye offend thee, plucke it out: It is better for thee to go into the kyngdome of God with one eye, then hauing two eyes, to be cast into hell fire:
{9:48} Where their worme dyeth not, and the fire goeth not out.
{9:49} Euery man shalbe salted with fire: and euery sacrifice shalbe seasoned with salt.
{9:50} Salt is good: But if the salt be vnsauerie, with what thyng shall you season it? Haue salt in your selues, and haue peace among your selues, one with an other.
{10:1} And when he rose from thence, he went into the coastes of Iurie, through the region that is beyonde Iordane: And the people resorted vnto hym a freshe, and as he was wont, he taught them agayne.
{10:2} And the pharisees came, and asked hym: Is it lawfull for a man to put away his wyfe? temptyng hym.
{10:3} And he aunswered, and sayde vnto them: What did Moyses commaunde you to do?
{10:4} And they sayde: Moyses suffred to write a booke of diuorcement, and to put her away.
{10:5} And Iesus aunswered, and sayde vnto the: For the hardnesse of your heart, he wrote this precept vnto you.
{10:6} But from the begynnyng of the creation, God made them male & female.
{10:7} And sayde for this cause shall a man leaue his father and mother, and byde by his wyfe:
{10:8} And they twayne shalbe one fleshe. So then are they no more twayne, but one fleshe.
{10:9} Therfore, what God hath coupled together, let not man seperate.
{10:10} And in the house, his disciples asked hym agayne, of the same matter.
{10:11} And he sayth vnto them: Whosoeuer putteth away his wyfe, & maryeth another, committeth adulterie agaynst her.
{10:12} And yf a woman put away her husbande, and be maryed to another, she committeth adulterie.
{10:13} And they brought young chyldren to hym, that he shoulde touche them: And his disciples rebuked those that brought them.
{10:14} But when Iesus sawe it, he was sore displeased, and sayde vnto them: Suffer the young children to come vnto me, forbyd them not: For of such, is the kyngdome of God.
{10:15} Ueryly I say vnto you, whosoeuer doth not receaue ye kingdome of God as a young childe, he shall not enter therin.
{10:16} And when he had taken them vp in his armes, he put his handes vpon the, and blessed them.
{10:17} And when he was gone foorth into the way, there came one runnyng, and kneeled to hym, and asked hym: good Maister, what shall I do, that I may inherite eternall lyfe?
{10:18} Iesus sayde vnto hym: Why callest thou me good? There is no man good but one, which is God.
{10:19} Thou knowest the commaundementes: Thou shalt not commit adulterie, Thou shalt not kyll, Thou shalt not steale, Thou shalt not beare false witnesse, Thou shalt defraude no man, Honour thy father and mother.
{10:20} He aunswered, and sayde vnto hym: Maister, all these haue I obserued from my youth.
{10:21} Iesus behelde hym, and loued hym, and sayde vnto hym, one thyng thou lackest: Go thy way, sell whatsoeuer thou hast, and geue to the poore, & thou shalt haue treasure in heauen, and come folowe me, and take vp the crosse.
{10:22} But he was discomforted because of that saying, and went away mournyng: for he had great possessions.
{10:23} And when Iesus had loked rounde about, he sayde vnto his disciples: Howe hardly shall they that haue riches, enter into the kyngdome of God?
{10:24} And the disciples were astonyed at his wordes. But Iesus aunswereth agayne, and sayth vnto them: Children, howe harde is it for the that trust in ryches, to enter into ye kyngdome of God.
{10:25} It is easier for a camel to go thorowe the eye of a needle, then for the riche to enter into the kyngdome of God.
{10:26} And they were astonyed out of measure, saying betwene them selues: who then can be saued?
{10:27} Iesus loked vpon them, & sayde: with men it is vnpossible, but not with God: for with God all thynges are possible.
{10:28} And Peter began to say vnto him: Lo, we haue forsaken all, & haue folowed thee.
{10:29} Iesus aunswered, & sayde: Ueryly I say vnto you, there is no man that hath forsaken house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wyfe, or chyldren, or landes, for my sake and the Gospels,
{10:30} But he shall receaue an hundreth folde nowe at this present, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and chyldren, and landes, with persecutions, and in the worlde to come, eternall lyfe.
{10:31} But many that are first, shalbe last: and the last, first.
{10:32} And they were in the way, goyng vp to Hierusalem: And Iesus went before them, and they were amazed, and folowed, and were afrayde. And Iesus toke the twelue agayne, and beganne to tell them what thynges shoulde happen vnto hym.
{10:33} Beholde, we go vp to Hierusalem, and the sonne of man shalbe delyuered vnto the hye priestes, & vnto the scribes and they shall condenme hym to death, and shall delyuer hym to the Gentiles.
{10:34} And they shall mocke hym, & scourge hym, spit vpon hym, and kyll hym: And the thirde day he shall ryse agayne.
{10:35} And Iames and Iohn, the sonnes of Zebedee, came vnto hym, saying: Maister, we would that thou shouldest do for vs, whatsoeuer we desyre.
{10:36} He sayde vnto them: What woulde ye, that I shoulde do for you?
{10:37} They sayde vnto hym: graunt vnto vs, that we may sit, one on thy ryght hande, and the other on thy left hande, in thy glory.
{10:38} But Iesus sayde vnto them, Ye wote not what ye aske: Can ye drynke of the cuppe that I drynke of? and be baptized with the baptisme that I am baptized with?
{10:39} And they sayde vnto hym: that we can. Iesus sayde vnto them: ye shall in deede drynke of the cup that I drynke of, and with the baptisme that I am baptized withall, shall ye be baptized:
{10:40} But to syt on my ryght hande, and on my left hande, is not myne to geue, but vnto them, for whom it is prepared.
{10:41} And when the ten hearde it, they began to disdaine at Iames and Iohn.
{10:42} But Iesus, when he had called them to hym, sayde vnto them: ye knowe, that they which seeme to beare rule among the Gentiles, raigne as Lordes ouer them: And they that be great among them, exercise aucthoritie vpon them.
{10:43} Neuerthelesse, so shall it not be among you: but whosoeuer of you, wyll be great among you, shalbe your minister:
{10:44} And whosoeuer of you wyll be the chiefest, shalbe seruaunt of all.
{10:45} For the sonne of man also came not to be ministred vnto: but to minister, & to geue his lyfe, a raunsome for many.
{10:46} And they came to Hierico: And as he went out of ye citie of Hierico with his disciples, and a great number of people, blynde Bartimeus the sonne of Timeus, sate by the hye wayes syde beggyng.
{10:47} And when he hearde that it was Iesus of Nazareth, he beganne to cry, and say: Iesus, thou sonne of Dauid, haue mercy on me.
{10:48} And many rebuked hym, that he shoulde holde his peace: But he cryed the more a great deale, thou sonne of Dauid haue mercy on me.
{10:49} And Iesus stoode styll, and commaunded hym to be called. And they called the blynde, saying vnto hym: Be of good comfort, ryse, he calleth the.
{10:50} And he threwe away his cloke, & rose, and came to Iesus.
{10:51} And Iesus aunswered, and sayde vnto hym: what wylt thou that I do vnto thee? The blynde sayde vnto hym: Maister, that I myght see.
{10:52} Iesus sayde vnto hym: Go thy way, thy fayth hath saued thee. And immediatly he receaued his sight, & folowed Iesus in the way.
{11:1} And when they came nye to Hierusalem, vnto Bethphage & Bethanie, at the mount of Oliues, he sendeth foorth two of his disciples,
{11:2} And sayth vnto them. Go your way into the towne, that is ouer against you: And assoone as ye be entred into it, ye shall fynde a colte bounde, wheron neuer man sate: loose hym, and bryng hym hyther.
{11:3} And yf any man say vnto you, why do ye so? Say ye, that the Lorde hath neede of hym: and strayghtway he wyll sende hym hyther.
{11:4} And they went their way, and founde the colt tyed by the doore without, in a place where two wayes met: and they loosed hym.
{11:5} And diuers of them that stoode there, sayde vnto them: What do ye loosyng the colte?
{11:6} And they sayde vnto them, euen as Iesus had commaunded: And they let them go.
{11:7} And they brought the colt to Iesus, and cast their garmentes on hym, and he sate vpon hym.
{11:8} And many spred their garmentes in the way: Other cut downe braunches of the trees, & strawed the in the way.
{11:9} And they that went before, and they that folowed, cryed, saying, Hosanna, blessed is he that commeth in the name of the Lorde.
{11:10} Blessed be the kyngdome, that commeth in the name of hym that is Lorde of our father Dauid: Hosanna in the hiest.
{11:11} And the Lorde entred into Hierusalem, and into the temple: And when he had loked rounde about, vpon all thynges, and nowe the euen tyde was come, he went out vnto Bethanie with the twelue.
{11:12} And on the morowe, when they were come out from Bethanie, he hungred.
{11:13} And when he had spyed a fygge tree a farre of, hauyng leaues, he came to see if he myght fynde any thyng theron: And when he came to it, he founde nothyng but leaues: for the tyme of figges was not yet.
{11:14} And Iesus aunswered, and sayde vnto the fygge tree: neuer man eate fruite of thee hereafter, whyle the worlde standeth. And his disciples hearde it.
{11:15} And they came to Hierusalem: And Iesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that solde and bought in the temple, & ouerthrewe the tables of the money chaungers, and the seates of them that solde doues:
{11:16} And woulde not suffer, that any man shoulde cary a vessell through ye temple.
{11:17} And he taught, saying vnto them: Is it not written, My house shalbe called the house of prayer vnto all nations? But ye haue made it a denne of thieues.
{11:18} And the scribes & hye priestes hearde it, and sought howe to destroy hym: For they feared hym, because all the people was astonyed at his doctrine.
{11:19} And when euen was come, Iesus went out of the citie.
{11:20} And in the mornyng, as they passed by, they sawe the fygge tree dryed vp by the rootes.
{11:21} And Peter remembred, and sayde vnto hym: Maister, beholde, the fygge tree which thou cursedst, is withered away.
{11:22} And Iesus aunswered, and sayde vnto them: haue fayth in God.
{11:23} For, veryly I say vnto you, that whosoeuer shall say vnto this mountayne: Be thou remoued, and be thou cast into the sea, & shall not doubt in his heart, but shall beleue yt those thynges which he sayth shall come to passe, whatsoeuer he sayth, shalbe vnto hym.
{11:24} Therfore I say vnto you, what thynges so euer ye desyre when ye pray, beleue that ye receaue them, & ye shall haue them.
{11:25} And when ye stande & pray, forgeue, yf ye haue ought agaynst any man: that your father also which is in heauen, may forgeue you your trespasses.
{11:26} But yf you do not forgeue: neither wyll your father, which is in heauen, forgeue you your trespasses.
{11:27} And they came agayne to Hierusalem: And as he walked in the temple, there came to hym the hye priestes, and the scribes, and the elders.
{11:28} And say vnto him: By what auctoritie doest thou these thynges? & who gaue thee this auctoritie, to do these thynges?
{11:29} Iesus aunswered, & sayde vnto them: I wyll also aske of you one question: and aunswere me, and I wyll tell you by what auctoritie I do these thynges.
{11:30} The baptisme of Iohn, whether was it from heauen, or of men? Aunswere me.
{11:31} And they reasoned with them selues, saying, yf we shall say from heauen: he wyll say, why then dyd ye not beleue hym?
{11:32} But yf we shal say, of men, we feare the people. For all men counted Iohn, that he was a very prophete.
{11:33} And they aunswered, and sayde vnto Iesus: we can not tell. And Iesus aunswered and sayde vnto them: neither wyll I tell you by what auctoritie I do these thynges.
{12:1} And he beganne to speake vnto them by parables. A certayne man planted a vineyarde, and compassed it about with an hedge, and ordeyned a wynepresse, and built a towre, and let it out vnto husbande men: and went into a straunge countrey.
{12:2} And when the tyme was come, he sent to the husbande men a seruaunt, that he myght receaue of the husbandmen, of the fruite of the vineyarde.
{12:3} And they caught hym, and beat hym, and sent hym away emptie.
{12:4} And moreouer, he sent vnto them another seruaunt: and at hym they cast stones, and brake his head, and sent him away agayne, all to reuiled.
{12:5} And agayne, he sent another, and hym they kylled: and many other, beatyng some, and kyllyng some.
{12:6} And so, when he had yet but one beloued sonne, he sent hym also at the last vnto them, saying: they wyll stande in awe of my sonne.
{12:7} But the husbandmen saide amongest them selues: this is the heyre, come, let vs kyll him, and the inheritaunce shalbe ours.
{12:8} And they toke hym, and kylled hym, and cast hym out of the vineyarde.
{12:9} What shall therfore, the Lorde of the vineyarde do? He shal come, and destroy the husbandmen, and wyll geue the vineyarde vnto other.
{12:10} Haue ye not read this Scripture? The stone which the builders dyd refuse, is become the chiefe stone of the corner:
{12:11} This is the Lordes doyng, and it is marueylous in our eyes.
{12:12} They went about also to take hym, and feared the people: For they knewe, that he had spoken the parable agaynst them. And they left hym, and went their way.
{12:13} And they sent vnto hym, certayne of the pharisees, and of the Herodians to take hym in his wordes.
{12:14} And assoone as they were come, they sayde vnto hym: Maister, we knowe that thou art true, & carest for no man, for thou considerest not the persons of men, but teachest the way of god truely: Is it lawfull to pay tribute to Caesar, or not?
{12:15} Ought we to geue, or ought we not to geue? But he seeyng their hypocrisie, sayde vnto them: Why tempt ye me? Bryng me a penie, that I may see it.
{12:16} And they brought it: And he sayth vnto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they sayde vnto hym: Caesars.
{12:17} And Iesus aunswered, and sayde vnto them: Geue to Caesar the thynges that belong to Caesar: and to God, the thynges which pertayne to God. And they marueyled at hym.
{12:18} There came also vnto hym, the Saducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and they asked hym, saying:
{12:19} Maister, Moyses wrote vnto vs, yf any mans brother dye, and leaue his wyfe behynde hym, & leaue no chyldren: that his brother shoulde take his wyfe, and rayse vp seede vnto his brother.
{12:20} There were seuen brethren: and the first toke a wyfe, and when he dyed, left no seede behynde hym.
{12:21} And the seconde toke her, and dyed, neither left any seede: And the thirde lykewyse.
{12:22} And seuen had her, and left no seede behynde them: Last of all, the wyfe dyed also.
{12:23} In the resurrection therfore, when they shall rise agayne, whose wyfe shall she be of them? for seuen had her to wife.
{12:24} And Iesus aunswered, and sayde vnto the: Do ye not therfore erre, because ye vnderstande not the Scriptures, neither the power of God?
{12:25} For when they shall ryse agayne from the dead, they neither marry, nor are geuen in maryage: but are as the Angels which are in heauen.
{12:26} As touchyng the dead, that they ryse agayne: haue ye not read in the booke of Moyses, howe in the bushe, God spake vnto him, saying: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob?
{12:27} He is not the God of the dead, but God of the lyuyng. Ye therefore do greatly erre.
{12:28} And when there came one of the scribes, & had heard them disputyng together, and perceaued that he had aunswered them well, he asked him: which is the first of all the comaundementes.
{12:29} Iesus aunswered hym, the first of all the commaundementes is: Heare O Israel, The Lorde our God, is one Lorde:
{12:30} And thou shalt loue the Lorde thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy mynde, and with all thy strength. This is the first commaundement.
{12:31} And the seconde is lyke vnto this: Thou shalt loue thy neyghbour as thy selfe. There is none other commaundement greater then these.
{12:32} And the scribe sayde vnto hym: well maister, thou hast sayde the trueth, for there is one God, & there is none but he.
{12:33} And to loue hym with all the heart, and with all the vnderstandyng, & with all the soule, and with all the strength, and to loue a mans neyghbour as hym selfe, is greater then all the burnt offerynges and sacrifices.
{12:34} And when Iesus sawe that he aunswered discretely, he sayde vnto hym: Thou art not farre from the kingdome of God. And no man after that, durst aske hym any question.
{12:35} And Iesus aunswered and sayde, teachyng in the temple: howe say the scribes that Christe is ye sonne of Dauid?
{12:36} For Dauid hym selfe, inspired with the holy ghost, sayde: The Lorde saide to my Lorde, sit on my right hande, tyll I make thyne enemies thy footestoole.
{12:37} Dauid hym selfe calleth hym Lorde: and howe is he then his sonne? And much people hearde hym gladly.
{12:38} And he sayde vnto them in his doctrine, beware of the scribes, whiche desire to go in long clothyng, and salutations in the market places,
{12:39} And the chiefe seates in the congregations, and the vppermost rowmes at feastes,
{12:40} Which deuoure widdowes houses, & vnder a pretence, make long prayers: These shal receaue greater dampnatio.
{12:41} And when Iesus sate ouer agaynst the treasurie, he behelde howe the people put money into the treasurie: And many that were rich, cast in much.
{12:42} And there came a certayne poore widdowe, & she threwe in two mites, which make a farthyng.
{12:43} And he called vnto hym his disciples, and sayth vnto them: Ueryly I say vnto you, that this poore widdowe hath cast more in, then all they which haue cast into the treasurie.
{12:44} For they all, dyd cast in of their superfluitie: but she, of her pouertie, dyd cast in all that she had, euen all her lyuyng.
{13:1} And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples sayde vnto hym: Maister, see what stones, & what buildynges are here.
{13:2} And Iesus aunswered, & sayde vnto hym: Seest thou these great buildynges? There shall not be left one stone vpon another, that shall not be throwen downe.
{13:3} And as he sate vpon the mount of Oliues, ouer agaynst the temple, Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and Andrewe, asked hym, secretely:
{13:4} Tell vs, when shall these thynges be? And what shalbe the signe when all these thynges shalbe fulfylled?
{13:5} And Iesus aunswered them, and began to say: take heede, lest any man deceaue you.
{13:6} For many shall come in my name, saying I am Christe: and shall deceaue many.
{13:7} When ye shall heare of warres, and tidynges of warres, be ye not troubled: For such thynges must nedes be, but the ende is not yet.
{13:8} For there shall nation aryse agaynst nation, and kyngdome agaynst kyngdome: And there shalbe earthquakes in diuers places, and famine shall there be, and troubles. These are the begynnyng of sorowes.
{13:9} But take ye heede to your selues: For they shall deliuer you vp to councels, and to synagogues, and ye shalbe beaten, yea, and shalbe brought before rulers & kynges for my sake, for a testimoniall vnto them.
{13:10} And the Gospel must first be published among all nations.
{13:11} But when they leade you, and present you, be not carefull aforehande, neither take thought what ye shall speake: but whatsoeuer is geuen you in the same houre, that speake ye. For it is not ye that speake, but the holy ghost.
{13:12} The brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the sonne: and the chyldren shall ryse agaynst their fathers and mothers, and shall put them to death.
{13:13} And ye shalbe hated of all men for my names sake: But who so endureth vnto the ende, the same shalbe safe.
{13:14} Moreouer, when ye see the abhomination of desolation, wherof is spoken by Daniel the prophete, stande where it ought not (let hym that readeth vnderstande) then let them that be in Iurie, flee to the mountaynes:
{13:15} And let hym that is on ye house toppe, not go downe into the house, neither enter therin, to fetch any thyng out of his house.
{13:16} And let hym that is in the fielde, not turne backe agayne vnto the thynges which he left behynde hym, for to take his garmente with hym.
{13:17} Wo shalbe then to them that are with chylde, and to them that geue sucke in those dayes.
{13:18} But pray ye that your flyght be not in the Wynter:
{13:19} For there shalbe in those dayes such tribulation, as was not from the begynnyng of creatures, which God created, vnto this tyme, neither shalbe.
{13:20} And except that the Lorde shoulde shorten those dayes, no fleshe shoulde be saued: But for the electes sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened those dayes.
{13:21} And then, yf any man say to you, lo here is Christe, lo he is there, beleue not.
{13:22} For false Christes, and false prophetes shall ryse, and shall shewe signes and wonders, to deceaue, yf it were possible, euen the elect.
{13:23} But take ye heede: Beholde, I haue shewed you all thynges before.
{13:24} Moreouer, in those dayes, after that tribulation, the sunne shall waxe darke, and the moone shall not geue her light.
{13:25} And the starres of heauen, shall fall: and the powers which are in heauen, shalbe shaken.
{13:26} And then shall they see the sonne of man commyng in the cloudes, with great power and glory.
{13:27} And then shall he sende his Angels, and shall gather together his elect, from the foure wyndes, from the ende of the earth, to the vtmost part of heauen.
{13:28} Learne a parable of the fygge tree. When his braunche is yet tender, and hath brought foorth leaues, ye knowe that sommer is neare:
{13:29} So ye in lyke maner, when ye see these thynges come to passe, vnderstand, that he is nye, euen at the doores.
{13:30} Ueryly I say vnto you, that this generation shall not passe, tyll all these thynges be done.
{13:31} Heauen and earth shall passe away, but my wordes shall not passe away.
{13:32} But of that day and tyme knoweth no man: no not the Angels which are in heauen, neither the sonne him selfe, saue the father only.
{13:33} Take heede, watche and pray: for ye knowe not when the tyme is.
{13:34} As a man which is gone into a straunge countrey, and hath left his house, and geuen auctoritie to his seruauntes, and to euery man his worke, and commaunded the porter to watche:
{13:35} Watche ye therfore, (for ye knowe not whe the maister of the house wyl come, at euen, or at mydnyght, whether at the cocke crowyng, or in the dawnyng.)
{13:36} Lest yf he come sodenly, he fynde you slepyng.
{13:37} And that I say vnto you, I say vnto all, watche.
{14:1} After two dayes was the feaste of the Passouer, & of vnleuened bread. And the hye priestes and the scribes, sought howe they myght take him by craft, and put hym to death.
{14:2} But they sayde: not in the feast day, lest any busines arise among the people.
{14:3} And when he was at Bethanie, in the house of Simon the leper, euen as he sate at meate, there came a woman hauyng an alabaster boxe of very precious oyntment, called Narde pisrike, and she brake the boxe, and powred it on his head.
{14:4} And there were some, that had indignation within them selues, and sayde: what neded this waste of oyntment?
{14:5} For it myght haue ben solde for more then three hundred pence, and haue ben geuen to the poore. And they grudged agaynst her.
{14:6} And Iesus sayde: let her alone, why trouble ye her? She hath done a good worke on me.
{14:7} For ye haue poore with you alwayes, and whensoeuer ye wyll, ye may do the good: but me haue ye not alwayes.
{14:8} She hath done that she coulde: she came aforehande, to annoynt my body to the burying.
{14:9} Ueryly I say vnto you, whersoeuer this Gospel shalbe preached, throughout the whole worlde, this also that she hath done, shalbe rehearsed, in remembraunce of her.
{14:10} And Iudas Iscariot, one of the twelue, went away vnto ye hye priestes, to betray hym vnto them.
{14:11} When they hearde that, they were glad, and promised that they woulde geue hym money. And he sought howe he myght conueniently betray hym.
{14:12} And the first day of vnleuened bread, when they dyd sacrifice the Passouer, his disciples sayde vnto hym: Where wylt thou that we go and prepare, that thou mayest eate the Passouer?
{14:13} And he sendeth foorth two of his disciples, and sayth vnto them: Go ye into the citie, & there shall meete you a man bearing a pitcher of water, folowe him.
{14:14} And whyther soeuer he goeth in, say ye to the good man of the house, the maister sayth: Where is the ghest chaumber, where I shall eate the Pasouer with my disciples?
{14:15} And he wyll shewe you a large vpper chaumber, paued and prepared: there make redy for vs.
{14:16} And his disciples went foorth, & came into the citie, & founde as he had sayd vnto them: & they made redy the Passouer.
{14:17} And when it was nowe euen tyde, he came with the twelue.
{14:18} And as they sate at boord & dyd eate, Iesus sayde: Ueryly I say vnto you, one of you, that eateth with me, shall betray me.
{14:19} And they began to be sory, and to say to hym one by one, is it I? And another sayde, is it I?
{14:20} He aunswered and sayde vnto them: It is one of the twelue, euen he that dyppeth with me in the platter.
{14:21} The sonne of man truely goeth as it is written of hym: but wo to that man by whom the sonne of man is betrayed. Good were it for that man, yf he had neuer ben borne.
{14:22} And as they dyd eate, Iesus toke bread: and whe he had blessed, he brake it and gaue to them, and sayde: Take, eate, this is my body.
{14:23} And he toke the cup, and when he had geuen thankes, he toke it to them: and they all dranke of it.
{14:24} And he sayde vnto them: This is my blood, of the newe Testament, which is shed for many.
{14:25} Ueryly I say vnto you, I wyll drinke no more of the fruite of the vine, vntyll that day, that I drinke it newe in the kyngdome of God.
{14:26} And when they had praysed God, they went out into ye mount of Oliues.
{14:27} And Iesus sayth vnto them: All ye shalbe offended because of me this nyght. For it is written: I wyll smyte the sheepehearde, and the sheepe shalbe scattered.
{14:28} But after that I am risen agayne, I wyll go into Galilee before you.
{14:29} Peter sayde vnto hym: And though all men be offended, yet wyll not I.
{14:30} And Iesus sayth vnto hym: Ueryly I say vnto thee, that this day, euen, in this night, before the cocke crowe twise, thou shalt deny me three tymes.
{14:31} But he spake more vehemently: no, yf I shoulde dye with thee, I wyll not deny thee. Likewise also sayde they all.
{14:32} And they came into a place which was named Gethsemani, and he sayth to his disciples: Sit ye heare, whyle I shall pray.
{14:33} And he taketh with hym, Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and began to waxe abasshed, and to be in an agonie.
{14:34} And sayth vnto them: My soule is heauie, euen vnto the death, tarry ye here and watche.
{14:35} And he went foorth a litle, and fell flat on the grounde, and prayed: that yf it were possible, the houre myght passe from hym.
{14:36} And he sayde: Abba father, all thynges are possible vnto thee, take away this cup from me. Neuerthelesse, not that I wyll: but that thou wylt, be done.
{14:37} And he came & founde them slepyng, and sayth vnto Peter: Simon, slepest thou? Couldest not thou watche one houre?
{14:38} Watche ye, and pray, lest ye enter into temptation: the spirite truely is redy, but the fleshe is weake.
{14:39} And agayne he went asyde, & prayed, and spake the same wordes.
{14:40} And he returned, and founde them a slepe agayne. For their eyes were heauie: neither wist they what to aunswere hym.
{14:41} And he came the thirde tyme, & sayde vnto them: slepe hencefoorth, and take your ease, it is inough: The houre is come, beholde, the sonne of man is betrayed into the handes of sinners.
{14:42} Ryse vp, let vs go: Lo, he that betrayeth me, is at hande.
{14:43} And immediatly whyle he yet spake, commeth Iudas, which was one of the twelue, and with hym a great number of people, with swordes & staues, from the hye priestes, and scribes, and elders.
{14:44} And he that betrayed hym, had geuen them a general token, saying: Who soeuer I do kysse, that same is he, take hym, and leade hym away warely.
{14:45} And assoone as he was come, he goeth strayghtway to hym, and sayth vnto hym: Maister, Maister, and kissed hym.
{14:46} And they layde their handes on hym, and toke hym.
{14:47} And one of them that stoode by, drewe out a sworde, & smote a seruaunt of the hye priest, and cut of his eare.
{14:48} And Iesus aunswered, and saide vnto them: Ye be come out as vnto a thiefe with swordes and with staues, for to take me.
{14:49} I was dayly with you in the temple, teachyng, and ye toke me not, but these thynges come to passe, that the Scriptures shoulde be fulfylled.
{14:50} And they all forsooke hym, & ranne away.
{14:51} And there folowed hym, a certayne young man, clothed in lynnen vpon the bare: and the young men caught hym.
{14:52} And he left his lynnen garment, and fled from them naked.
{14:53} And they ledde Iesus away to the hyest priest, and with hym came all the hye priestes, and the elders, and the scribes.
{14:54} And Peter folowed hym a great way of, euen tyl he was come into the palace of the hye priest, and he sate with the seruauntes, and warmed hym selfe at the fyre.
{14:55} And the hye priestes, and all the councell sought for witnesse agaynst Iesus, to put hym to death, and founde none.
{14:56} For many bare false witnesse agaynst hym, but their witnesse agreed not together.
{14:57} And there arose certayne, and brought false witnesse agaynst hym, saying.
{14:58} We hearde hym say: I wyll destroy this temple that is made with handes, and within three dayes I wyll buylde another, made without handes.
{14:59} But yet their witnesse agreed not together.
{14:60} And the hye priest stoode vp amongest them, and asked Iesus, saying: Aunswerest thou nothyng? Howe is it that these beare witnesse agaynst thee?
{14:61} But he helde his peace, & aunswered nothyng. Agayne, the hyest priest asked hym, and sayde vnto hym: Art thou Christe, the sonne of the blessed?
{14:62} And Iesus sayde, I am: And ye shall see the sonne of man sittyng on the ryght hande of power, and commyng in the cloudes of heauen.
{14:63} Then the hye priest rent his clothes, and sayde: What neede we any further witnesses?
{14:64} Ye haue hearde blasphemie: what thinke ye? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death.
{14:65} And some began to spyt at hym, and to couer his face, and to beate hym with fistes, and to say vnto hym, prophecie. And the seruauntes dyd beate hym with roddes.
{14:66} And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there came one of the wenches of the hyest priest:
{14:67} And when she sawe Peter warmyng hym selfe, she loketh on hym, and sayth: And thou also wast with Iesus of Nazareth.
{14:68} And he denyed, saying: I knowe hym not, neither wote I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porche, and the cocke crewe.
{14:69} And a damsell, when she sawe hym agayne, began to say to the that stoode by, this is one of them.
{14:70} And he denyed it agayne. And anone after, they that stoode by, sayde agayne to Peter: Surely, thou art one of the, for thou art of Galilee, and thy speache agreeth therto.
{14:71} But he began to curse, and to sweare, saying: I knowe not this man of whom ye speake.
{14:72} And the seconde tyme the cocke crewe, & Peter remembred the worde that Iesus sayde vnto hym, before the cocke crowe twise, thou shalt deny me three tymes: And he began to weepe.
{15:1} And anone in the dawnyng, the hye priestes held a councel, with the elders, and the scribes, and the whole congregation, and bound Iesus, and ledde hym away, and deliuered hym to Pilate.
{15:2} And Pilate asked hym: Art thou the kyng of the Iewes? And he aunswered and sayde vnto hym: thou sayest it?
{15:3} And the hye priestes accused hym of many thynges.
{15:4} So Pilate asked hym agayne, saying: Aunswerest thou nothyng? Beholde, howe many thynges they witnesse agaynst thee.
{15:5} Iesus yet aunswered nothyng, so that Pilate marueyled.
{15:6} At that feast, Pilate dyd delyuer vnto them a prisoner, whomsoeuer they woulde desire.
{15:7} And there was one, that was named Barabbas, which lay bounde, with them that made insurrection: Which men had committed murther also in the insurrection.
{15:8} And the people crying aloude, began to desire hym that he woulde do, according as he had euer done vnto them.
{15:9} Pilate aunswered them, saying: Wyll ye that I let loose vnto you the kyng of the Iewes?
{15:10} For he knewe, that the hye priestes had delyuered hym of enuie.
{15:11} But the hye priestes moued the people, that he shoulde rather delyuer Barabbas vnto them.
{15:12} Pilate aunswered agayne, and sayde vnto them: What wyll ye then that I do vnto hym, whom ye call the kyng of the Iewes?
{15:13} And they cryed agayne, crucifie hym.
{15:14} Pilate sayde vnto them: What euyll hath he done? And they cryed the more feruently, crucifie hym.
{15:15} And so Pilate, wyllyng to content the people, let loose Barabbas vnto them, and deliuered vp Iesus, when he had scourged hym, for to be crucified.
{15:16} And the souldiers led hym away, into the hall, called Prætorium, and called together the whole bande of souldiers:
{15:17} And they clothed hym with purple, and they platted a crowne of thornes, and crowned hym withall,
{15:18} And began to salute hym: Hayle kyng of the Iewes.
{15:19} And they smote hym on the head with a reede, & did spit vpon him, and bowed their knees, and worshipped hym.
{15:20} And when they had mocked hym, they toke the purple of hym, and put his owne clothes on hym, and led hym out to crucifie hym.
{15:21} And they compelled one that passed by, called Simon of Cyrene (commyng out of the fielde, the father of Alexander and Rufus) to beare his crosse.
{15:22} And they brought hym to a place named Golgotha, which is, if a man interprete it, the place of dead mens sculles.
{15:23} And they gaue hym to drynke, wyne myngled with myrre: but he receaued it not.
{15:24} And when they had crucified hym, they parted his garmentes, castyng lottes vpon them, what euery man shoulde take.
{15:25} And it was the thyrde houre, and they crucified hym.
{15:26} And the title of his cause was written: THE KYNG OF THE IEWES.
{15:27} And they crucifed with hym two thieues: the one on the ryght hande, and the other on his left.
{15:28} And the Scripture was fulfylled which sayth: He was counted among the wycked.
{15:29} And they that went by, rayled on him, wagging their heades, and saying: A wretche, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three dayes,
{15:30} Saue thy selfe, and come downe from the crosse.
{15:31} Lykewyse also mocked hym the hye priestes among them selues, with the scribes, and sayde: He saued other men, hym selfe he can not saue.
{15:32} Let Christe the kyng of Israel descende nowe from the crosse, that we may see, and beleue. And they that were crucified with hym, checked hym also.
{15:33} And when the sixth houre was come, darknesse arose ouer all the earth, vntill the nynth houre.
{15:34} And at the nynth houre, Iesus cryed with a loude voyce, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, yf one interprete it, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
{15:35} And some of them that stoode by, whe they hearde that, sayde: Beholde, he calleth for Elias.
{15:36} And one ran, and fylled a spunge full of vineger, and put it on a reede, & gaue hym to drynke, saying: let hym alone, let vs see whether Elias wyll come and take hym downe.
{15:37} But Iesus cryed with a loude voyce, and gaue vp the ghost.
{15:38} And the vayle of the temple dyd rent in two peeces, from the toppe to the bottome.
{15:39} And when the Centurion, which stoode before hym, sawe, that he so cryed, and gaue vp the ghost, he sayde: Truely this man was the sonne of God.
{15:40} There were also women a good way of, beholdyng hym: among whom was Marie Magdalene, and Marie the mother of Iames the litle, and of Ioses, and Salome.
{15:41} Which also when he was in Galilee, had folowed hym, and ministred vnto hym: and many other women, which came vp with hym vnto Hierusalem.
{15:42} And nowe when the euen was come, (because it was the day of preparyng, that goeth before the Sabboth)
{15:43} Ioseph of the citie of Aramathia, a noble councellour, which also loked for the kyngdome of God, came, and went in boldely vnto Pilate, and begged of hym the body of Iesu.
{15:44} And Pilate marueyled that he was alredy dead: and called vnto hym the Centurion, and asked of hym, whether he had ben any whyle dead.
{15:45} And when he knewe the trueth of the Centurion, he gaue the body to Ioseph.
{15:46} And he bought a lynnen cloth, & toke hym downe, and wrapped hym in the lynnen cloth, & layde him in a sepulchre, that was hewe out of the rocke, & roulled a stone vnto the doore of ye sepulchre.
{15:47} And Marie Magdalene, and Marie Ioses, behelde where he was layde.
{16:1} And whe the Sabboth day was past, Marie Magdalen and Marie the mother of Iames, & Salome, bought sweete smellynge oyntmentes, that they myght come and annoynt hym.
{16:2} And early in the mornyng, the first day of the Sabbothes, they came vnto the sepulchre, when the sunne was rysen:
{16:3} And they sayde among them selues, who shall roule vs away the stone from the doore of the sepulchre?
{16:4} And when they loked, they sawe how that the stone was rouled awaye, for it was a very great one.
{16:5} And they went into the sepulchre, and sawe a young man syttyng on the ryght syde, clothed in a long whyte garment, and they were amased.
{16:6} And he sayth vnto them, be not amased: ye seke Iesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: He is risen, he is not here, beholde the place where they had put hym.
{16:7} But go your way, & tell his disciples, and Peter, that he goeth before you into Galilee, there shall ye see hym, as he saide vnto you.
{16:8} And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre, for they trembled & were amased: neither sayde they any thing to any man, for they were afraide.
{16:9} When Iesus was rysen early, the first day after the Sabboth, he appeared firste to Marie Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seuen deuils.
{16:10} And she went & tolde them that were with hym, as they mourned & wept.
{16:11} And they, when they hearde that he was alyue, and had ben seene of her, beleued it not.
{16:12} After that, appeared he vnto two of them in another fourme, as they walked and went into the countrey.
{16:13} And they went and tolde it vnto the residue: and they beleued not these also.
{16:14} Afterwarde, he appeared vnto the eleuen, as they sate at meate, and cast in their teeth their vnbeliefe and hardnes of heart, because they beleued not them whiche had seene that he was rysen agayne from the dead.
{16:15} And he sayde vnto them: Go ye into all the worlde, and preache the Gospell to all creatures.
{16:16} He that beleueth, and is baptized, shalbe saued: But he that beleueth not, shalbe dampned.
{16:17} And these tokens shall folowe them that beleue. In my name they shal cast out deuils, they shall speake with newe tongues,
{16:18} They shall driue away serpentes: and yf they drinke any deadly thyng, it shall not hurte them: They shall lay their handes on the sicke, & they shal recouer.
{16:19} So then, when the Lorde had spoken vnto them, he was receaued into heauen, and sate hym downe on the ryght hande of God.
{16:20} And they went foorth, and preached euerywhere, the Lorde workyng with them, and confirmyng the worde with signes folowyng.
