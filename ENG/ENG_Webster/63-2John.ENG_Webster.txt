{1:1} The elder to the elect lady, and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;
{1:2} For the truth's sake which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.
{1:3} Grace be with you, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
{1:4} I rejoiced greatly, that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.
{1:5} And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
{1:6} And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, that as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.
{1:7} For many deceivers have entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver, and an antichrist.
{1:8} Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.
{1:9} Whoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.
{1:10} If any one cometh to you, and bringeth not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither wish him happiness:
{1:11} For he that wisheth him happiness, is partaker of his evil deeds.
{1:12} Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.
{1:13} The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
