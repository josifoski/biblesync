{i1:1} Greeting
{1:1} Paul, called as an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will, and Sosthenes our brother:
{1:2} To God’s church at Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus and called as saints, with all those in every place who call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord — both their Lord and ours.
{1:3} Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
{i1:4} Thanksgiving
{1:4} I always thank my God for you because of God’s grace given to you in Christ Jesus,
{1:5} that by Him you were enriched in everything — in all speech and all knowledge.
{1:6} In this way, the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you,
{1:7} so that you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
{1:8} He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you will be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
{1:9} God is faithful; you were called by Him into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
{i1:10} Divisions at Corinth
{1:10} Now I urge you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree in what you say, that there be no divisions among you, and that you be united with the same understanding and the same conviction.
{1:11} For it has been reported to me about you, my brothers, by members of Chloe’s household, that there is rivalry among you.
{1:12} What I am saying is this: Each of you says, “I’m with Paul,” or “I’m with Apollos,” or “I’m with Cephas,” or “I’m with Christ.”
{1:13} Is Christ divided? Was it Paul who was crucified for you? Or were you baptized in Paul’s name?
{1:14} I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,
{1:15} so that no one can say you were baptized in my name.
{1:16} I did, in fact, baptize the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don’t know if I baptized anyone else.
{1:17} For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to evangelize — not with clever words, so that the cross of Christ will not be emptied of its effect.
{i1:18} Christ the Power and Wisdom of God
{1:18} For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but it is God’s power to us who are being saved.
{1:19} For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will set aside the understanding of the experts.
{1:20} Where is the philosopher? Where is the scholar? Where is the debater of this age? Hasn’t God made the world’s wisdom foolish?
{1:21} For since, in God’s wisdom, the world did not know God through wisdom, God was pleased to save those who believe through the foolishness of the message preached.
{1:22} For the Jews ask for signs and the Greeks seek wisdom,
{1:23} but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the Gentiles.
{1:24} Yet to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is God’s power and God’s wisdom,
{1:25} because God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.
{i1:26} Boasting Only in the Lord
{1:26} Brothers, consider your calling: Not many are wise from a human perspective, not many powerful, not many of noble birth.
{1:27} Instead, God has chosen what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen what is weak in the world to shame the strong.
{1:28} God has chosen what is insignificant and despised in the world — what is viewed as nothing — to bring to nothing what is viewed as something,
{1:29} so that no one can boast in His presence.
{1:30} But it is from Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became God-given wisdom for us — our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption,
{1:31} in order that, as it is written: The one who boasts must boast in the Lord.
{i2:1} Paul’s Proclamation
{2:1} When I came to you, brothers, announcing the testimony of God to you, I did not come with brilliance of speech or wisdom.
{2:2} For I didn’t think it was a good idea to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
{2:3} I came to you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.
{2:4} My speech and my proclamation were not with persuasive words of wisdom but with a powerful demonstration by the Spirit,
{2:5} so that your faith might not be based on men’s wisdom but on God’s power.
{i2:6} Spiritual Wisdom
{2:6} However, we do speak a wisdom among the mature, but not a wisdom of this age, or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.
{2:7} On the contrary, we speak God’s hidden wisdom in a mystery, a wisdom God predestined before the ages for our glory.
{2:8} None of the rulers of this age knew this wisdom, for if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
{2:9} But as it is written: What eye did not see and ear did not hear, and what never entered the human mind — God prepared this for those who love Him.
{2:10} Now God has revealed these things to us by the Spirit, for the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.
{2:11} For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man that is in him? In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
{2:12} Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we may understand what has been freely given to us by God.
{2:13} We also speak these things, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people.
{2:14} But the unbeliever does not welcome what comes from God’s Spirit, because it is foolishness to him; he is not able to understand it since it is evaluated spiritually.
{2:15} The spiritual person, however, can evaluate everything, yet he himself cannot be evaluated by anyone.
{2:16} For who has known the Lord’s mind, that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.
{i3:1} The Problem of Immaturity
{3:1} Brothers, I was not able to speak to you as spiritual people but as people of the flesh, as babies in Christ.
{3:2} I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, because you were not yet ready for it. In fact, you are still not ready,
{3:3} because you are still fleshly. For since there is envy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and living like unbelievers?
{3:4} For whenever someone says, “I’m with Paul,” and another, “I’m with Apollos,” are you not unspiritual people?
{i3:5} The Role of God’s Servants
{3:5} What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? They are servants through whom you believed, and each has the role the Lord has given.
{3:6} I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.
{3:7} So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.
{3:8} Now the one planting and the one watering are one in purpose, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.
{3:9} For we are God’s coworkers. You are God’s field, God’s building.
{3:10} According to God’s grace that was given to me, I have laid a foundation as a skilled master builder, and another builds on it. But each one must be careful how he builds on it.
{3:11} For no one can lay any other foundation than what has been laid down. That foundation is Jesus Christ.
{3:12} If anyone builds on that foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,
{3:13} each one’s work will become obvious, for the day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire; the fire will test the quality of each one’s work.
{3:14} If anyone’s work that he has built survives, he will receive a reward.
{3:15} If anyone’s work is burned up, it will be lost, but he will be saved; yet it will be like an escape through fire.
{3:16} Don’t you yourselves know that you are God’s sanctuary and that the Spirit of God lives in you?
{3:17} If anyone destroys God’s sanctuary, God will destroy him; for God’s sanctuary is holy, and that is what you are.
{i3:18} The Folly of Human Wisdom
{3:18} No one should deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, he must become foolish so that he can become wise.
{3:19} For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, since it is written: He catches the wise in their craftiness;
{3:20} and again, The Lord knows that the reasonings of the wise are meaningless.
{3:21} So no one should boast in human leaders, for everything is yours —
{3:22} whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come — everything is yours,
{3:23} and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
{i4:1} The Faithful Manager
{4:1} A person should consider us in this way: as servants of Christ and managers of God’s mysteries.
{4:2} In this regard, it is expected of managers that each one of them be found faithful.
{4:3} It is of little importance to me that I should be evaluated by you or by any human court. In fact, I don’t even evaluate myself.
{4:4} For I am not conscious of anything against myself, but I am not justified by this. The One who evaluates me is the Lord.
{4:5} Therefore don’t judge anything prematurely, before the Lord comes, who will both bring to light what is hidden in darkness and reveal the intentions of the hearts. And then praise will come to each one from God.
{i4:6} The Apostles’ Example of Humility
{4:6} Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the saying: “Nothing beyond what is written.” The purpose is that none of you will be inflated with pride in favor of one person over another.
{4:7} For who makes you so superior? What do you have that you didn’t receive? If, in fact, you did receive it, why do you boast as if you hadn’t received it?
{4:8} You are already full! You are already rich! You have begun to reign as kings without us — and I wish you did reign, so that we could also reign with you!
{4:9} For I think God has displayed us, the apostles, in last place, like men condemned to die: We have become a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men.
{4:10} We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are distinguished, but we are dishonored!
{4:11} Up to the present hour we are both hungry and thirsty; we are poorly clothed, roughly treated, homeless;
{4:12} we labor, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;
{4:13} when we are slandered, we respond graciously. Even now, we are like the world’s garbage, like the dirt everyone scrapes off their sandals.
{i4:14} Paul’s Fatherly Care
{4:14} I’m not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my dear children.
{4:15} For you can have 10,000 instructors in Christ, but you can’t have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
{4:16} Therefore I urge you to imitate me.
{4:17} This is why I have sent Timothy to you. He is my dearly loved and faithful son in the Lord. He will remind you about my ways in Christ Jesus, just as I teach everywhere in every church.
{4:18} Now some are inflated with pride, as though I were not coming to you.
{4:19} But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will know not the talk but the power of those who are inflated with pride.
{4:20} For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.
{4:21} What do you want? Should I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?
{i5:1} Immoral Church Members
{5:1} It is widely reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and the kind of sexual immorality that is not even tolerated among the Gentiles — a man is living with his father’s wife.
{5:2} And you are inflated with pride, instead of filled with grief so that he who has committed this act might be removed from your congregation.
{5:3} For though I am absent in body but present in spirit, I have already decided about the one who has done this thing as though I were present.
{5:4} When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus with my spirit and with the power of our Lord Jesus,
{5:5} turn that one over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord.
{5:6} Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast permeates the whole batch of dough?
{5:7} Clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch. You are indeed unleavened, for Christ our Passover has been sacrificed.
{5:8} Therefore, let us observe the feast, not with old yeast or with the yeast of malice and evil but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
{i5:9} Church Discipline
{5:9} I wrote to you in a letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.
{5:10} I did not mean the immoral people of this world or the greedy and swindlers or idolaters; otherwise you would have to leave the world.
{5:11} But now I am writing you not to associate with anyone who claims to be a believer who is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or verbally abusive, a drunkard or a swindler. Do not even eat with such a person.
{5:12} For what business is it of mine to judge outsiders? Don’t you judge those who are inside?
{5:13} But God judges outsiders. Put away the evil person from among yourselves.
{i6:1} Lawsuits among Believers
{6:1} If any of you has a legal dispute against another, do you dare go to court before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
{6:2} Or don’t you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest cases?
{6:3} Don’t you know that we will judge angels — not to mention ordinary matters?
{6:4} So if you have cases pertaining to this life, do you select those who have no standing in the church to judge?
{6:5} I say this to your shame! Can it be that there is not one wise person among you who is able to arbitrate between his brothers?
{6:6} Instead, believer goes to court against believer, and that before unbelievers!
{6:7} Therefore, to have legal disputes against one another is already a moral failure for you. Why not rather put up with injustice? Why not rather be cheated?
{6:8} Instead, you act unjustly and cheat — and you do this to believers!
{6:9} Don’t you know that the unrighteous will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be deceived: No sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, or anyone practicing homosexuality,
{6:10} no thieves, greedy people, drunkards, verbally abusive people, or swindlers will inherit God’s kingdom.
{6:11} And some of you used to be like this. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
{i6:12} Glorifying God in Body and Spirit
{6:12} “Everything is permissible for me,” but not everything is helpful. “Everything is permissible for me,” but I will not be brought under the control of anything.
{6:13} “Food for the stomach and the stomach for food,” but God will do away with both of them. The body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
{6:14} God raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by His power.
{6:15} Don’t you know that your bodies are a part of Christ’s body? So should I take a part of Christ’s body and make it part of a prostitute? Absolutely not!
{6:16} Don’t you know that anyone joined to a prostitute is one body with her? For Scripture says, The two will become one flesh.
{6:17} But anyone joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.
{6:18} Run from sexual immorality! “Every sin a person can commit is outside the body.” On the contrary, the person who is sexually immoral sins against his own body.
{6:19} Don’t you know that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God? You are not your own,
{6:20} for you were bought at a price. Therefore glorify God in your body.
{i7:1} Principles of Marriage
{7:1} Now in response to the matters you wrote about: “It is good for a man not to have relations with a woman.”
{7:2} But because sexual immorality is so common, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband.
{7:3} A husband should fulfill his marital responsibility to his wife, and likewise a wife to her husband.
{7:4} A wife does not have the right over her own body, but her husband does. In the same way, a husband does not have the right over his own body, but his wife does.
{7:5} Do not deprive one another sexually — except when you agree for a time, to devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again; otherwise, Satan may tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
{7:6} I say the following as a concession, not as a command.
{7:7} I wish that all people were just like me. But each has his own gift from God, one person in this way and another in that way.
{i7:8} A Word to the Unmarried
{7:8} I say to the unmarried and to widows: It is good for them if they remain as I am.
{7:9} But if they do not have self-control, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with desire.
{i7:10} About Married People
{7:10} I command the married — not I, but the Lord — a wife is not to leave her husband.
{7:11} But if she does leave, she must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband — and a husband is not to leave his wife.
{7:12} But I (not the Lord) say to the rest: If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she is willing to live with him, he must not leave her.
{7:13} Also, if any woman has an unbelieving husband and he is willing to live with her, she must not leave her husband.
{7:14} For the unbelieving husband is set apart for God by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is set apart for God by the husband. Otherwise your children would be corrupt, but now they are set apart for God.
{7:15} But if the unbeliever leaves, let him leave. A brother or a sister is not bound in such cases. God has called you to live in peace.
{7:16} For you, wife, how do you know whether you will save your husband? Or you, husband, how do you know whether you will save your wife?
{i7:17} Various Situations of Life
{7:17} However, each one must live his life in the situation the Lord assigned when God called him. This is what I command in all the churches.
{7:18} Was anyone already circumcised when he was called? He should not undo his circumcision. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? He should not get circumcised.
{7:19} Circumcision does not matter and uncircumcision does not matter, but keeping God’s commands does.
{7:20} Each person should remain in the life situation in which he was called.
{7:21} Were you called while a slave? It should not be a concern to you. But if you can become free, by all means take the opportunity.
{7:22} For he who is called by the Lord as a slave is the Lord’s freedman. Likewise he who is called as a free man is Christ’s slave.
{7:23} You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.
{7:24} Brothers, each person should remain with God in whatever situation he was called.
{i7:25} About the Unmarried and Widows
{7:25} About virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I do give an opinion as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy.
{7:26} Therefore I consider this to be good because of the present distress: It is fine for a man to remain as he is.
{7:27} Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
{7:28} However, if you do get married, you have not sinned, and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But such people will have trouble in this life, and I am trying to spare you.
{7:29} And I say this, brothers: The time is limited, so from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none,
{7:30} those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess,
{7:31} and those who use the world as though they did not make full use of it. For this world in its current form is passing away.
{7:32} I want you to be without concerns. An unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord — how he may please the Lord.
{7:33} But a married man is concerned about the things of the world — how he may please his wife —
{7:34} and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or a virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the things of the world — how she may please her husband.
{7:35} Now I am saying this for your own benefit, not to put a restraint on you, but because of what is proper and so that you may be devoted to the Lord without distraction.
{7:36} But if any man thinks he is acting improperly toward his virgin, if she is past marriageable age, and so it must be, he can do what he wants. He is not sinning; they can get married.
{7:37} But he who stands firm in his heart (who is under no compulsion, but has control over his own will ) and has decided in his heart to keep his own virgin, will do well.
{7:38} So then he who marries his virgin does well, but he who does not marry will do better.
{7:39} A wife is bound as long as her husband is living. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to anyone she wants — only in the Lord.
{7:40} But she is happier if she remains as she is, in my opinion. And I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
{i8:1} Food Offered to Idols
{8:1} About food offered to idols: We know that “we all have knowledge.” Knowledge inflates with pride, but love builds up.
{8:2} If anyone thinks he knows anything, he does not yet know it as he ought to know it.
{8:3} But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.
{8:4} About eating food offered to idols, then, we know that “an idol is nothing in the world,” and that “there is no God but one.”
{8:5} For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth — as there are many “gods” and many “lords” —
{8:6} yet for us there is one God, the Father. All things are from Him, and we exist for Him. And there is one Lord, Jesus Christ. All things are through Him, and we exist through Him.
{8:7} However, not everyone has this knowledge. In fact, some have been so used to idolatry up until now that when they eat food offered to an idol, their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
{8:8} Food will not make us acceptable to God. We are not inferior if we don’t eat, and we are not better if we do eat.
{8:9} But be careful that this right of yours in no way becomes a stumbling block to the weak.
{8:10} For if someone sees you, the one who has this knowledge, dining in an idol’s temple, won’t his weak conscience be encouraged to eat food offered to idols?
{8:11} Then the weak person, the brother for whom Christ died, is ruined by your knowledge.
{8:12} Now when you sin like this against the brothers and wound their weak conscience, you are sinning against Christ.
{8:13} Therefore, if food causes my brother to fall, I will never again eat meat, so that I won’t cause my brother to fall.
{i9:1} Paul’s Example as an Apostle
{9:1} Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
{9:2} If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you, for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
{9:3} My defense to those who examine me is this:
{9:4} Don’t we have the right to eat and drink?
{9:5} Don’t we have the right to be accompanied by a Christian wife like the other apostles, the Lord’s brothers, and Cephas?
{9:6} Or do Barnabas and I alone have no right to refrain from working?
{9:7} Who ever goes to war at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not drink the milk from the flock?
{9:8} Am I saying this from a human perspective? Doesn’t the law also say the same thing?
{9:9} For it is written in the law of Moses, Do not muzzle an ox while it treads out grain. Is God really concerned with oxen?
{9:10} Or isn’t He really saying it for us? Yes, this is written for us, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes should do so in hope of sharing the crop.
{9:11} If we have sown spiritual things for you, is it too much if we reap material benefits from you?
{9:12} If others have this right to receive benefits from you, don’t we even more? However, we have not made use of this right; instead we endure everything so that we will not hinder the gospel of Christ.
{9:13} Don’t you know that those who perform the temple services eat the food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the offerings of the altar?
{9:14} In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should earn their living by the gospel.
{9:15} But I have used none of these rights, and I have not written this to make it happen that way for me. For it would be better for me to die than for anyone to deprive me of my boast!
{9:16} For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast, because an obligation is placed on me. And woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
{9:17} For if I do this willingly, I have a reward, but if unwillingly, I am entrusted with a stewardship.
{9:18} What then is my reward? To preach the gospel and offer it free of charge and not make full use of my authority in the gospel.
{9:19} Although I am a free man and not anyone’s slave, I have made myself a slave to everyone, in order to win more people.
{9:20} To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win Jews; to those under the law, like one under the law — though I myself am not under the law — to win those under the law.
{9:21} To those who are without that law, like one without the law — not being without God’s law but within Christ’s law — to win those without the law.
{9:22} To the weak I became weak, in order to win the weak. I have become all things to all people, so that I may by every possible means save some.
{9:23} Now I do all this because of the gospel, so I may become a partner in its benefits.
{9:24} Don’t you know that the runners in a stadium all race, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way to win the prize.
{9:25} Now everyone who competes exercises self-control in everything. However, they do it to receive a crown that will fade away, but we a crown that will never fade away.
{9:26} Therefore I do not run like one who runs aimlessly or box like one beating the air.
{9:27} Instead, I discipline my body and bring it under strict control, so that after preaching to others, I myself will not be disqualified.
{i10:1} Warnings from Israel’s Past
{10:1} Now I want you to know, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, all passed through the sea,
{10:2} and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.
{10:3} They all ate the same spiritual food,
{10:4} and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ.
{10:5} But God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the wilderness.
{10:6} Now these things became examples for us, so that we will not desire evil things as they did.
{10:7} Don’t become idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and got up to play.
{10:8} Let us not commit sexual immorality as some of them did, and in a single day 23,000 people fell dead.
{10:9} Let us not test Christ as some of them did and were destroyed by snakes.
{10:10} Nor should we complain as some of them did, and were killed by the destroyer.
{10:11} Now these things happened to them as examples, and they were written as a warning to us, on whom the ends of the ages have come.
{10:12} So, whoever thinks he stands must be careful not to fall.
{10:13} No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to humanity. God is faithful, and He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation He will also provide a way of escape so that you are able to bear it.
{i10:14} Warning against Idolatry
{10:14} Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry.
{10:15} I am speaking as to wise people. Judge for yourselves what I say.
{10:16} The cup of blessing that we give thanks for, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of Christ?
{10:17} Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for all of us share that one bread.
{10:18} Look at the people of Israel. Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in what is offered on the altar?
{10:19} What am I saying then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
{10:20} No, but I do say that what they sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God. I do not want you to participate with demons!
{10:21} You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot share in the Lord’s table and the table of demons.
{10:22} Or are we provoking the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?
{i10:23} Christian Liberty
{10:23} “Everything is permissible,” but not everything is helpful. “Everything is permissible,” but not everything builds up.
{10:24} No one should seek his own good, but the good of the other person.
{10:25} Eat everything that is sold in the meat market, asking no questions for conscience’ sake,
{10:26} for the earth is the Lord’s, and all that is in it.
{10:27} If one of the unbelievers invites you over and you want to go, eat everything that is set before you, without raising questions of conscience.
{10:28} But if someone says to you, “This is food offered to an idol,” do not eat it, out of consideration for the one who told you, and for conscience’ sake.
{10:29} I do not mean your own conscience, but the other person’s. For why is my freedom judged by another person’s conscience?
{10:30} If I partake with thanks, why am I slandered because of something I give thanks for?
{10:31} Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for God’s glory.
{10:32} Give no offense to the Jews or the Greeks or the church of God,
{10:33} just as I also try to please all people in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, so that they may be saved.
{11:1} Imitate me, as I also imitate Christ.
{i11:2} Instructions about Head Coverings
{11:2} Now I praise you because you always remember me and keep the traditions just as I delivered them to you.
{11:3} But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.
{11:4} Every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head dishonors his head.
{11:5} But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since that is one and the same as having her head shaved.
{11:6} So if a woman’s head is not covered, her hair should be cut off. But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, she should be covered.
{11:7} A man, in fact, should not cover his head, because he is God’s image and glory, but woman is man’s glory.
{11:8} For man did not come from woman, but woman came from man.
{11:9} And man was not created for woman, but woman for man.
{11:10} This is why a woman should have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.
{11:11} In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, and man is not independent of woman.
{11:12} For just as woman came from man, so man comes through woman, and all things come from God.
{11:13} Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
{11:14} Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair it is a disgrace to him,
{11:15} but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her as a covering.
{11:16} But if anyone wants to argue about this, we have no other custom, nor do the churches of God.
{i11:17} The Lord’s Supper
{11:17} Now in giving the following instruction I do not praise you, since you come together not for the better but for the worse.
{11:18} For to begin with, I hear that when you come together as a church there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.
{11:19} There must, indeed, be factions among you, so that those who are approved may be recognized among you.
{11:20} Therefore, when you come together, it is not really to eat the Lord’s Supper.
{11:21} For at the meal, each one eats his own supper ahead of others. So one person is hungry while another gets drunk!
{11:22} Don’t you have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you look down on the church of God and embarrass those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I do not praise you for this!
{11:23} For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: On the night when He was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread,
{11:24} gave thanks, broke it, and said, “This is My body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of Me.”
{11:25} In the same way, after supper He also took the cup and said, “This cup is the new covenant established by My blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”
{11:26} For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.
{i11:27} Self-Examination
{11:27} Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy way will be guilty of sin against the body and blood of the Lord.
{11:28} So a man should examine himself; in this way he should eat the bread and drink from the cup.
{11:29} For whoever eats and drinks without recognizing the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself.
{11:30} This is why many are sick and ill among you, and many have fallen asleep.
{11:31} If we were properly evaluating ourselves, we would not be judged,
{11:32} but when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord, so that we may not be condemned with the world.
{11:33} Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
{11:34} If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you gather together you will not come under judgment. And I will give instructions about the other matters whenever I come.
{i12:1} Diversity of Spiritual Gifts
{12:1} Now concerning what comes from the Spirit: brothers, I do not want you to be unaware.
{12:2} You know that when you were pagans, you used to be led off to the idols that could not speak.
{12:3} Therefore I am informing you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.
{12:4} Now there are different gifts, but the same Spirit.
{12:5} There are different ministries, but the same Lord.
{12:6} And there are different activities, but the same God activates each gift in each person.
{12:7} A demonstration of the Spirit is given to each person to produce what is beneficial:
{12:8} to one is given a message of wisdom through the Spirit, to another, a message of knowledge by the same Spirit,
{12:9} to another, faith by the same Spirit, to another, gifts of healing by the one Spirit,
{12:10} to another, the performing of miracles, to another, prophecy, to another, distinguishing between spirits, to another, different kinds of languages, to another, interpretation of languages.
{12:11} But one and the same Spirit is active in all these, distributing to each person as He wills.
{i12:12} Unity Yet Diversity in the Body
{12:12} For as the body is one and has many parts, and all the parts of that body, though many, are one body — so also is Christ.
{12:13} For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body — whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free — and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.
{12:14} So the body is not one part but many.
{12:15} If the foot should say, “Because I’m not a hand, I don’t belong to the body,” in spite of this it still belongs to the body.
{12:16} And if the ear should say, “Because I’m not an eye, I don’t belong to the body,” in spite of this it still belongs to the body.
{12:17} If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
{12:18} But now God has placed each one of the parts in one body just as He wanted.
{12:19} And if they were all the same part, where would the body be?
{12:20} Now there are many parts, yet one body.
{12:21} So the eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” Or again, the head can’t say to the feet, “I don’t need you!”
{12:22} But even more, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are necessary.
{12:23} And those parts of the body that we think to be less honorable, we clothe these with greater honor, and our unpresentable parts have a better presentation.
{12:24} But our presentable parts have no need of clothing. Instead, God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the less honorable,
{12:25} so that there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same concern for each other.
{12:26} So if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
{12:27} Now you are the body of Christ, and individual members of it.
{12:28} And God has placed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, next miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, managing, various kinds of languages.
{12:29} Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all do miracles?
{12:30} Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in other languages? Do all interpret?
{12:31} But desire the greater gifts. And I will show you an even better way.
{i13:1} Love: The Superior Way
{13:1} If I speak human or angelic languages but do not have love, I am a sounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
{13:2} If I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can move mountains but do not have love, I am nothing.
{13:3} And if I donate all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body in order to boast but do not have love, I gain nothing.
{13:4} Love is patient, love is kind. Love does not envy, is not boastful, is not conceited,
{13:5} does not act improperly, is not selfish, is not provoked, and does not keep a record of wrongs.
{13:6} Love finds no joy in unrighteousness but rejoices in the truth.
{13:7} It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
{13:8} Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for languages, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will come to an end.
{13:9} For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
{13:10} But when the perfect comes, the partial will come to an end.
{13:11} When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put aside childish things.
{13:12} For now we see indistinctly, as in a mirror, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, as I am fully known.
{13:13} Now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.
{i14:1} Prophecy: A Superior Gift
{14:1} Pursue love and desire spiritual gifts, and above all that you may prophesy.
{14:2} For the person who speaks in another language is not speaking to men but to God, since no one understands him; however, he speaks mysteries in the Spirit.
{14:3} But the person who prophesies speaks to people for edification, encouragement, and consolation.
{14:4} The person who speaks in another language builds himself up, but he who prophesies builds up the church.
{14:5} I wish all of you spoke in other languages, but even more that you prophesied. The person who prophesies is greater than the person who speaks in languages, unless he interprets so that the church may be built up.
{14:6} But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in other languages, how will I benefit you unless I speak to you with a revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?
{14:7} Even inanimate things that produce sounds — whether flute or harp — if they don’t make a distinction in the notes, how will what is played on the flute or harp be recognized?
{14:8} In fact, if the trumpet makes an unclear sound, who will prepare for battle?
{14:9} In the same way, unless you use your tongue for intelligible speech, how will what is spoken be known? For you will be speaking into the air.
{14:10} There are doubtless many different kinds of languages in the world, and all have meaning.
{14:11} Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker will be a foreigner to me.
{14:12} So also you — since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek to excel in building up the church.
{14:13} Therefore the person who speaks in another language should pray that he can interpret.
{14:14} For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.
{14:15} What then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with my understanding. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with my understanding.
{14:16} Otherwise, if you praise with the spirit, how will the uninformed person say “Amen” at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?
{14:17} For you may very well be giving thanks, but the other person is not being built up.
{14:18} I thank God that I speak in other languages more than all of you;
{14:19} yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, in order to teach others also, than 10,000 words in another language.
{14:20} Brothers, don’t be childish in your thinking, but be infants in regard to evil and adult in your thinking.
{14:21} It is written in the law: I will speak to these people by people of other languages and by the lips of foreigners, and even then, they will not listen to Me, says the Lord.
{14:22} It follows that speaking in other languages is intended as a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers. But prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers.
{14:23} Therefore, if the whole church assembles together and all are speaking in other languages and people who are uninformed or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your minds?
{14:24} But if all are prophesying and some unbeliever or uninformed person comes in, he is convicted by all and is judged by all.
{14:25} The secrets of his heart will be revealed, and as a result he will fall facedown and worship God, proclaiming, “God is really among you.”
{i14:26} Order in Church Meetings
{14:26} What then is the conclusion, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, another language, or an interpretation. All things must be done for edification.
{14:27} If any person speaks in another language, there should be only two, or at the most three, each in turn, and someone must interpret.
{14:28} But if there is no interpreter, that person should keep silent in the church and speak to himself and to God.
{14:29} Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should evaluate.
{14:30} But if something has been revealed to another person sitting there, the first prophet should be silent.
{14:31} For you can all prophesy one by one, so that everyone may learn and everyone may be encouraged.
{14:32} And the prophets’ spirits are under the control of the prophets,
{14:33} since God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,
{14:34} the women should be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak, but should be submissive, as the law also says.
{14:35} And if they want to learn something, they should ask their own husbands at home, for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church meeting.
{14:36} Did the word of God originate from you, or did it come to you only?
{14:37} If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, he should recognize that what I write to you is the Lord’s command.
{14:38} But if anyone ignores this, he will be ignored.
{14:39} Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in other languages.
{14:40} But everything must be done decently and in order.
{i15:1} Resurrection Essential to the Gospel
{15:1} Now brothers, I want to clarify for you the gospel I proclaimed to you; you received it and have taken your stand on it.
{15:2} You are also saved by it, if you hold to the message I proclaimed to you — unless you believed for no purpose.
{15:3} For I passed on to you as most important what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
{15:4} that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,
{15:5} and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.
{15:6} Then He appeared to over 500 brothers at one time; most of them are still alive, but some have fallen asleep.
{15:7} Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles.
{15:8} Last of all, as to one abnormally born, He also appeared to me.
{15:9} For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
{15:10} But by God’s grace I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not ineffective. However, I worked more than any of them, yet not I, but God’s grace that was with me.
{15:11} Therefore, whether it is I or they, so we proclaim and so you have believed.
{i15:12} Resurrection Essential to the Faith
{15:12} Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say, “There is no resurrection of the dead”?
{15:13} But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised;
{15:14} and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is without foundation, and so is your faith.
{15:15} In addition, we are found to be false witnesses about God, because we have testified about God that He raised up Christ — whom He did not raise up if in fact the dead are not raised.
{15:16} For if the dead are not raised, Christ has not been raised.
{15:17} And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins.
{15:18} Therefore, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have also perished.
{15:19} If we have put our hope in Christ for this life only, we should be pitied more than anyone.
{i15:20} Christ’s Resurrection Guarantees Ours
{15:20} But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
{15:21} For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also comes through a man.
{15:22} For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
{15:23} But each in his own order: Christ, the firstfruits; afterward, at His coming, those who belong to Christ.
{15:24} Then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father, when He abolishes all rule and all authority and power.
{15:25} For He must reign until He puts all His enemies under His feet.
{15:26} The last enemy to be abolished is death.
{15:27} For God has put everything under His feet. But when it says “everything” is put under Him, it is obvious that He who puts everything under Him is the exception.
{15:28} And when everything is subject to Christ, then the Son Himself will also be subject to the One who subjected everything to Him, so that God may be all in all.
{i15:29} Resurrection Supported by Christian Experience
{15:29} Otherwise what will they do who are being baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, then why are people baptized for them?
{15:30} Why are we in danger every hour?
{15:31} I affirm by the pride in you that I have in Christ Jesus our Lord: I die every day!
{15:32} If I fought wild animals in Ephesus with only human hope, what good did that do me? If the dead are not raised, Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.
{15:33} Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.”
{15:34} Come to your senses and stop sinning, for some people are ignorant about God. I say this to your shame.
{i15:35} The Nature of the Resurrection Body
{15:35} But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? What kind of body will they have when they come?”
{15:36} Foolish one! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
{15:37} And as for what you sow — you are not sowing the future body, but only a seed, perhaps of wheat or another grain.
{15:38} But God gives it a body as He wants, and to each of the seeds its own body.
{15:39} Not all flesh is the same flesh; there is one flesh for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.
{15:40} There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is different from that of the earthly ones.
{15:41} There is a splendor of the sun, another of the moon, and another of the stars; for one star differs from another star in splendor.
{15:42} So it is with the resurrection of the dead: Sown in corruption, raised in incorruption;
{15:43} sown in dishonor, raised in glory; sown in weakness, raised in power;
{15:44} sown a natural body, raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
{15:45} So it is written: The first man Adam became a living being; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.
{15:46} However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, then the spiritual.
{15:47} The first man was from the earth and made of dust; the second man is from heaven.
{15:48} Like the man made of dust, so are those who are made of dust; like the heavenly man, so are those who are heavenly.
{15:49} And just as we have borne the image of the man made of dust, we will also bear the image of the heavenly man.
{i15:50} Victorious Resurrection
{15:50} Brothers, I tell you this: Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, and corruption cannot inherit incorruption.
{15:51} Listen! I am telling you a mystery: We will not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed,
{15:52} in a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.
{15:53} For this corruptible must be clothed with incorruptibility, and this mortal must be clothed with immortality.
{15:54} When this corruptible is clothed with incorruptibility, and this mortal is clothed with immortality, then the saying that is written will take place: Death has been swallowed up in victory.
{15:55} Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting?
{15:56} Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
{15:57} But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!
{15:58} Therefore, my dear brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the Lord’s work, knowing that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
{i16:1} Collection for the Jerusalem Church
{16:1} Now about the collection for the saints: You should do the same as I instructed the Galatian churches.
{16:2} On the first day of the week, each of you is to set something aside and save in keeping with how he prospers, so that no collections will need to be made when I come.
{16:3} When I arrive, I will send with letters those you recommend to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.
{16:4} If it is suitable for me to go as well, they can travel with me.
{i16:5} Paul’s Travel Plans
{16:5} I will come to you after I pass through Macedonia — for I will be traveling through Macedonia —
{16:6} and perhaps I will remain with you or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I go.
{16:7} I don’t want to see you now just in passing, for I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord allows.
{16:8} But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,
{16:9} because a wide door for effective ministry has opened for me — yet many oppose me.
{16:10} If Timothy comes, see that he has nothing to fear from you, because he is doing the Lord’s work, just as I am.
{16:11} Therefore, no one should look down on him. Send him on his way in peace so he can come to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers.
{16:12} About our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers, but he was not at all willing to come now. However, he will come when he has an opportunity.
{i16:13} Final Exhortation
{16:13} Be alert, stand firm in the faith, act like a man, be strong.
{16:14} Your every action must be done with love.
{16:15} Brothers, you know the household of Stephanas: They are the firstfruits of Achaia and have devoted themselves to serving the saints. I urge you
{16:16} also to submit to such people, and to everyone who works and labors with them.
{16:17} I am pleased to have Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus present, because these men have made up for your absence.
{16:18} For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore recognize such people.
{i16:19} Conclusion
{16:19} The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, along with the church that meets in their home.
{16:20} All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
{16:21} This greeting is in my own hand — Paul.
{16:22} If anyone does not love the Lord, a curse be on him. Marana tha that is, Lord, come!
{16:23} The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
{16:24} My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus.
