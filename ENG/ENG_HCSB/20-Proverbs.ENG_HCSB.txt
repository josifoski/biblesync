{i1:1} The Purpose of Proverbs
{1:1} The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
{1:2} For learning what wisdom and discipline are; for understanding insightful sayings;
{1:3} for receiving wise instruction in righteousness, justice, and integrity;
{1:4} for teaching shrewdness to the inexperienced, knowledge and discretion to a young man —
{1:5} a wise man will listen and increase his learning, and a discerning man will obtain guidance —
{1:6} for understanding a proverb or a parable, the words of the wise, and their riddles.
{1:7} The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and discipline.
{i1:8} Avoid the Path of the Violent
{1:8} Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction, and don’t reject your mother’s teaching,
{1:9} for they will be a garland of grace on your head and a gold chain around your neck.
{1:10} My son, if sinners entice you, don’t be persuaded.
{1:11} If they say — “Come with us! Let’s set an ambush and kill someone. Let’s attack some innocent person just for fun!
{1:12} Let’s swallow them alive, like Sheol, still healthy as they go down to the Pit.
{1:13} We’ll find all kinds of valuable property and fill our houses with plunder.
{1:14} Throw in your lot with us, and we’ll all share our money” —
{1:15} my son, don’t travel that road with them or set foot on their path,
{1:16} because their feet run toward trouble and they hurry to commit murder.
{1:17} It is foolish to spread a net where any bird can see it,
{1:18} but they set an ambush to kill themselves; they attack their own lives.
{1:19} Such are the paths of all who make profit dishonestly; it takes the lives of those who receive it.
{i1:20} Wisdom’s Plea
{1:20} Wisdom calls out in the street; she raises her voice in the public squares.
{1:21} She cries out above the commotion; she speaks at the entrance of the city gates:
{1:22} “How long, foolish ones, will you love ignorance? How long will you mockers enjoy mocking and you fools hate knowledge?
{1:23} If you respond to my warning, then I will pour out my spirit on you and teach you my words.
{1:24} Since I called out and you refused, extended my hand and no one paid attention,
{1:25} since you neglected all my counsel and did not accept my correction,
{1:26} I, in turn, will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when terror strikes you,
{1:27} when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when trouble and stress overcome you.
{1:28} Then they will call me, but I won’t answer; they will search for me, but won’t find me.
{1:29} Because they hated knowledge, didn’t choose to fear the Lord,
{1:30} were not interested in my counsel, and rejected all my correction,
{1:31} they will eat the fruit of their way and be glutted with their own schemes.
{1:32} For the turning away of the inexperienced will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them.
{1:33} But whoever listens to me will live securely and be free from the fear of danger.”
{i2:1} Wisdom’s Worth
{2:1} My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you,
{2:2} listening closely to wisdom and directing your heart to understanding;
{2:3} furthermore, if you call out to insight and lift your voice to understanding,
{2:4} if you seek it like silver and search for it like hidden treasure,
{2:5} then you will understand the fear of the Lord and discover the knowledge of God.
{2:6} For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.
{2:7} He stores up success for the upright; He is a shield for those who live with integrity
{2:8} so that He may guard the paths of justice and protect the way of His loyal followers.
{2:9} Then you will understand righteousness, justice, and integrity — every good path.
{2:10} For wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will delight your heart.
{2:11} Discretion will watch over you, and understanding will guard you,
{2:12} rescuing you from the way of evil — from the one who says perverse things,
{2:13} from those who abandon the right paths to walk in ways of darkness,
{2:14} from those who enjoy doing evil and celebrate perversion,
{2:15} whose paths are crooked, and whose ways are devious.
{2:16} It will rescue you from a forbidden woman, from a stranger with her flattering talk,
{2:17} who abandons the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;
{2:18} for her house sinks down to death and her ways to the land of the departed spirits.
{2:19} None return who go to her; none reach the paths of life.
{2:20} So follow the way of good people, and keep to the paths of the righteous.
{2:21} For the upright will inhabit the land, and those of integrity will remain in it;
{2:22} but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous uprooted from it.
{i3:1} Trust the Lord
{3:1} My son, don’t forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commands;
{3:2} for they will bring you many days, a full life, and well-being.
{3:3} Never let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Tie them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart.
{3:4} Then you will find favor and high regard in the sight of God and man.
{3:5} Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding;
{3:6} think about Him in all your ways, and He will guide you on the right paths.
{3:7} Don’t consider yourself to be wise; fear the Lord and turn away from evil.
{3:8} This will be healing for your body and strengthening for your bones.
{3:9} Honor the Lord with your possessions and with the first produce of your entire harvest;
{3:10} then your barns will be completely filled, and your vats will overflow with new wine.
{3:11} Do not despise the Lord’s instruction, my son, and do not loathe His discipline;
{3:12} for the Lord disciplines the one He loves, just as a father, the son he delights in.
{i3:13} Wisdom Brings Happiness
{3:13} Happy is a man who finds wisdom and who acquires understanding,
{3:14} for she is more profitable than silver, and her revenue is better than gold.
{3:15} She is more precious than jewels; nothing you desire compares with her.
{3:16} Long life is in her right hand; in her left, riches and honor.
{3:17} Her ways are pleasant, and all her paths, peaceful.
{3:18} She is a tree of life to those who embrace her, and those who hold on to her are happy.
{3:19} The Lord founded the earth by wisdom and established the heavens by understanding.
{3:20} By His knowledge the watery depths broke open, and the clouds dripped with dew.
{3:21} Maintain your competence and discretion. My son, don’t lose sight of them.
{3:22} They will be life for you and adornment for your neck.
{3:23} Then you will go safely on your way; your foot will not stumble.
{3:24} When you lie down, you will not be afraid; you will lie down, and your sleep will be pleasant.
{3:25} Don’t fear sudden danger or the ruin of the wicked when it comes,
{3:26} for the Lord will be your confidence and will keep your foot from a snare.
{i3:27} Treat Others Fairly
{3:27} When it is in your power, don’t withhold good from the one it belongs to.
{3:28} Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go away! Come back later. I’ll give it tomorrow” — when it is there with you.
{3:29} Don’t plan any harm against your neighbor, for he trusts you and lives near you.
{3:30} Don’t accuse anyone without cause, when he has done you no harm.
{3:31} Don’t envy a violent man or choose any of his ways;
{3:32} for the devious are detestable to the Lord, but He is a friend to the upright.
{3:33} The Lord’s curse is on the household of the wicked, but He blesses the home of the righteous;
{3:34} He mocks those who mock, but gives grace to the humble.
{3:35} The wise will inherit honor, but He holds up fools to dishonor.
{i4:1} A Father’s Example
{4:1} Listen, my sons, to a father’s discipline, and pay attention so that you may gain understanding,
{4:2} for I am giving you good instruction. Don’t abandon my teaching.
{4:3} When I was a son with my father, tender and precious to my mother,
{4:4} he taught me and said: “Your heart must hold on to my words. Keep my commands and live.
{4:5} Get wisdom, get understanding; don’t forget or turn away from the words of my mouth.
{4:6} Don’t abandon wisdom, and she will watch over you; love her, and she will guard you.
{4:7} Wisdom is supreme — so get wisdom. And whatever else you get, get understanding.
{4:8} Cherish her, and she will exalt you; if you embrace her, she will honor you.
{4:9} She will place a garland of grace on your head; she will give you a crown of beauty.”
{i4:10} Two Ways of Life
{4:10} Listen, my son. Accept my words, and you will live many years.
{4:11} I am teaching you the way of wisdom; I am guiding you on straight paths.
{4:12} When you walk, your steps will not be hindered; when you run, you will not stumble.
{4:13} Hold on to instruction; don’t let go. Guard it, for it is your life.
{4:14} Don’t set foot on the path of the wicked; don’t proceed in the way of evil ones.
{4:15} Avoid it; don’t travel on it. Turn away from it, and pass it by.
{4:16} For they can’t sleep unless they have done what is evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble.
{4:17} They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.
{4:18} The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, shining brighter and brighter until midday.
{4:19} But the way of the wicked is like the darkest gloom; they don’t know what makes them stumble.
{i4:20} The Straight Path
{4:20} My son, pay attention to my words; listen closely to my sayings.
{4:21} Don’t lose sight of them; keep them within your heart.
{4:22} For they are life to those who find them, and health to one’s whole body.
{4:23} Guard your heart above all else, for it is the source of life.
{4:24} Don’t let your mouth speak dishonestly, and don’t let your lips talk deviously.
{4:25} Let your eyes look forward; fix your gaze straight ahead.
{4:26} Carefully consider the path for your feet, and all your ways will be established.
{4:27} Don’t turn to the right or to the left; keep your feet away from evil.
{i5:1} Avoid Seduction
{5:1} My son, pay attention to my wisdom; listen closely to my understanding
{5:2} so that you may maintain discretion and your lips safeguard knowledge.
{5:3} Though the lips of the forbidden woman drip honey and her words are smoother than oil,
{5:4} in the end she’s as bitter as wormwood and as sharp as a double-edged sword.
{5:5} Her feet go down to death; her steps head straight for Sheol.
{5:6} She doesn’t consider the path of life; she doesn’t know that her ways are unstable.
{5:7} So now, my sons, listen to me, and don’t turn away from the words of my mouth.
{5:8} Keep your way far from her. Don’t go near the door of her house.
{5:9} Otherwise, you will give up your vitality to others and your years to someone cruel;
{5:10} strangers will drain your resources, and your earnings will end up in a foreigner’s house.
{5:11} At the end of your life, you will lament when your physical body has been consumed,
{5:12} and you will say, “How I hated discipline, and how my heart despised correction.
{5:13} I didn’t obey my teachers or listen closely to my mentors.
{5:14} I am on the verge of complete ruin before the entire community.”
{i5:15} Enjoy Marriage
{5:15} Drink water from your own cistern, water flowing from your own well.
{5:16} Should your springs flow in the streets, streams of water in the public squares?
{5:17} They should be for you alone and not for you to share with strangers.
{5:18} Let your fountain be blessed, and take pleasure in the wife of your youth.
{5:19} A loving doe, a graceful fawn — let her breasts always satisfy you; be lost in her love forever.
{5:20} Why, my son, would you be infatuated with a forbidden woman or embrace the breast of a stranger?
{5:21} For a man’s ways are before the Lord’s eyes, and He considers all his paths.
{5:22} A wicked man’s iniquities entrap him; he is entangled in the ropes of his own sin.
{5:23} He will die because there is no discipline, and be lost because of his great stupidity.
{i6:1} Financial Entanglements
{6:1} My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor or entered into an agreement with a stranger,
{6:2} you have been trapped by the words of your lips — ensnared by the words of your mouth.
{6:3} Do this, then, my son, and free yourself, for you have put yourself in your neighbor’s power: Go, humble yourself, and plead with your neighbor.
{6:4} Don’t give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids.
{6:5} Escape like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from a fowler’s trap.
{i6:6} Laziness
{6:6} Go to the ant, you slacker! Observe its ways and become wise.
{6:7} Without leader, administrator, or ruler,
{6:8} it prepares its provisions in summer; it gathers its food during harvest.
{6:9} How long will you stay in bed, you slacker? When will you get up from your sleep?
{6:10} A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to rest,
{6:11} and your poverty will come like a robber, your need, like a bandit.
{i6:12} The Malicious Man
{6:12} A worthless person, a wicked man goes around speaking dishonestly,
{6:13} winking his eyes, signaling with his feet, and gesturing with his fingers.
{6:14} He always plots evil with perversity in his heart — he stirs up trouble.
{6:15} Therefore calamity will strike him suddenly; he will be shattered instantly — beyond recovery.
{i6:16} What the Lord Hates
{6:16} The Lord hates six things; in fact, seven are detestable to Him:
{6:17} arrogant eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,
{6:18} a heart that plots wicked schemes, feet eager to run to evil,
{6:19} a lying witness who gives false testimony, and one who stirs up trouble among brothers.
{i6:20} Warning against Adultery
{6:20} My son, keep your father’s command, and don’t reject your mother’s teaching.
{6:21} Always bind them to your heart; tie them around your neck.
{6:22} When you walk here and there, they will guide you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; when you wake up, they will talk to you.
{6:23} For a command is a lamp, teaching is a light, and corrective discipline is the way to life.
{6:24} They will protect you from an evil woman, from the flattering tongue of a stranger.
{6:25} Don’t lust in your heart for her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyelashes.
{6:26} For a prostitute’s fee is only a loaf of bread, but an adulteress goes after a precious life.
{6:27} Can a man embrace fire and his clothes not be burned?
{6:28} Can a man walk on burning coals without scorching his feet?
{6:29} So it is with the one who sleeps with another man’s wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.
{6:30} People don’t despise the thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry.
{6:31} Still, if caught, he must pay seven times as much; he must give up all the wealth in his house.
{6:32} The one who commits adultery lacks sense; whoever does so destroys himself.
{6:33} He will get a beating and dishonor, and his disgrace will never be removed.
{6:34} For jealousy enrages a husband, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.
{6:35} He will not be appeased by anything or be persuaded by lavish gifts.
{7:1} My son, obey my words, and treasure my commands.
{7:2} Keep my commands and live; protect my teachings as the pupil of your eye.
{7:3} Tie them to your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.
{7:4} Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding your relative.
{7:5} She will keep you from a forbidden woman, a stranger with her flattering talk.
{i7:6} A Story of Seduction
{7:6} At the window of my house I looked through my lattice.
{7:7} I saw among the inexperienced, I noticed among the youths, a young man lacking sense.
{7:8} Crossing the street near her corner, he strolled down the road to her house
{7:9} at twilight, in the evening, in the dark of the night.
{7:10} A woman came to meet him dressed like a prostitute, having a hidden agenda.
{7:11} She is loud and defiant; her feet do not stay at home.
{7:12} Now in the street, now in the squares, she lurks at every corner.
{7:13} She grabs him and kisses him; she brazenly says to him,
{7:14} “I’ve made fellowship offerings; today I’ve fulfilled my vows.
{7:15} So I came out to meet you, to search for you, and I’ve found you.
{7:16} I’ve spread coverings on my bed — richly colored linen from Egypt.
{7:17} I’ve perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
{7:18} Come, let’s drink deeply of lovemaking until morning. Let’s feast on each other’s love!
{7:19} My husband isn’t home; he went on a long journey.
{7:20} He took a bag of money with him and will come home at the time of the full moon.”
{7:21} She seduces him with her persistent pleading; she lures with her flattering talk.
{7:22} He follows her impulsively like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer bounding toward a trap
{7:23} until an arrow pierces its liver, like a bird darting into a snare — he doesn’t know it will cost him his life.
{7:24} Now, my sons, listen to me, and pay attention to the words of my mouth.
{7:25} Don’t let your heart turn aside to her ways; don’t stray onto her paths.
{7:26} For she has brought many down to death; her victims are countless.
{7:27} Her house is the road to Sheol, descending to the chambers of death.
{i8:1} Wisdom’s Appeal
{8:1} Doesn’t Wisdom call out? Doesn’t Understanding make her voice heard?
{8:2} At the heights overlooking the road, at the crossroads, she takes her stand.
{8:3} Beside the gates at the entry to the city, at the main entrance, she cries out:
{8:4} “People, I call out to you; my cry is to mankind.
{8:5} Learn to be shrewd, you who are inexperienced; develop common sense, you who are foolish.
{8:6} Listen, for I speak of noble things, and what my lips say is right.
{8:7} For my mouth tells the truth, and wickedness is detestable to my lips.
{8:8} All the words of my mouth are righteous; none of them are deceptive or perverse.
{8:9} All of them are clear to the perceptive, and right to those who discover knowledge.
{8:10} Accept my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than pure gold.
{8:11} For wisdom is better than jewels, and nothing desirable can compare with it.
{8:12} I, Wisdom, share a home with shrewdness and have knowledge and discretion.
{8:13} To fear the Lord is to hate evil. I hate arrogant pride, evil conduct, and perverse speech.
{8:14} I possess good advice and competence; I have understanding and strength.
{8:15} It is by me that kings reign and rulers enact just law;
{8:16} by me, princes lead, as do nobles and all righteous judges.
{8:17} I love those who love me, and those who search for me find me.
{8:18} With me are riches and honor, lasting wealth and righteousness.
{8:19} My fruit is better than solid gold, and my harvest than pure silver.
{8:20} I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,
{8:21} giving wealth as an inheritance to those who love me, and filling their treasuries.
{8:22} “The Lord made me at the beginning of His creation, before His works of long ago.
{8:23} I was formed before ancient times, from the beginning, before the earth began.
{8:24} I was born when there were no watery depths and no springs filled with water.
{8:25} I was delivered before the mountains and hills were established,
{8:26} before He made the land, the fields, or the first soil on earth.
{8:27} I was there when He established the heavens, when He laid out the horizon on the surface of the ocean,
{8:28} when He placed the skies above, when the fountains of the ocean gushed out,
{8:29} when He set a limit for the sea so that the waters would not violate His command, when He laid out the foundations of the earth.
{8:30} I was a skilled craftsman beside Him. I was His delight every day, always rejoicing before Him.
{8:31} I was rejoicing in His inhabited world, delighting in the human race.
{8:32} “And now, my sons, listen to me; those who keep my ways are happy.
{8:33} Listen to instruction and be wise; don’t ignore it.
{8:34} Anyone who listens to me is happy, watching at my doors every day, waiting by the posts of my doorway.
{8:35} For the one who finds me finds life and obtains favor from the Lord,
{8:36} but the one who misses me harms himself; all who hate me love death.”
{i9:1} Wisdom versus Foolishness
{9:1} Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars.
{9:2} She has prepared her meat; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.
{9:3} She has sent out her female servants; she calls out from the highest points of the city:
{9:4} “Whoever is inexperienced, enter here!” To the one who lacks sense, she says,
{9:5} “Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine I have mixed.
{9:6} Leave inexperience behind, and you will live; pursue the way of understanding.
{9:7} The one who corrects a mocker will bring dishonor on himself; the one who rebukes a wicked man will get hurt.
{9:8} Don’t rebuke a mocker, or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.
{9:9} Instruct a wise man, and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man, and he will learn more.
{9:10} “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
{9:11} For by Wisdom your days will be many, and years will be added to your life.
{9:12} If you are wise, you are wise for your own benefit; if you mock, you alone will bear the consequences.”
{9:13} The woman Folly is rowdy; she is gullible and knows nothing.
{9:14} She sits by the doorway of her house, on a seat at the highest point of the city,
{9:15} calling to those who pass by, who go straight ahead on their paths:
{9:16} “Whoever is inexperienced, enter here!” To the one who lacks sense, she says,
{9:17} “Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten secretly is tasty!”
{9:18} But he doesn’t know that the departed spirits are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.

{21:30} No wisdom, no understanding, and no counsel will prevail against the Lord.
{21:31} A horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory comes from the Lord.
{22:1} A good name is to be chosen over great wealth; favor is better than silver and gold.
{22:2} The rich and the poor have this in common: the Lord made them both.
{22:3} A sensible person sees danger and takes cover, but the inexperienced keep going and are punished.
{22:4} The result of humility is fear of the Lord, along with wealth, honor, and life.
{22:5} There are thorns and snares on the path of the crooked; the one who guards himself stays far from them.
{22:6} Teach a youth about the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.
{22:7} The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is a slave to the lender.
{22:8} The one who sows injustice will reap disaster, and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.
{22:9} A generous person will be blessed, for he shares his food with the poor.
{22:10} Drive out a mocker, and conflict goes too; then quarreling and dishonor will cease.
{22:11} The one who loves a pure heart and gracious lips — the king is his friend.
{22:12} The Lord’s eyes keep watch over knowledge, but He overthrows the words of the treacherous.
{22:13} The slacker says, “There’s a lion outside! I’ll be killed in the public square!”
{22:14} The mouth of the forbidden woman is a deep pit; a man cursed by the Lord will fall into it.
{22:15} Foolishness is tangled up in the heart of a youth; the rod of discipline will drive it away from him.
{22:16} Oppressing the poor to enrich oneself, and giving to the rich — both lead only to poverty.
{i22:17} Words of the Wise
{22:17} Listen closely, pay attention to the words of the wise, and apply your mind to my knowledge.
{22:18} For it is pleasing if you keep them within you and if they are constantly on your lips.
{22:19} I have instructed you today — even you — so that your confidence may be in the Lord.
{22:20} Haven’t I written for you thirty sayings about counsel and knowledge,
{22:21} in order to teach you true and reliable words, so that you may give a dependable report to those who sent you?
{22:22} Don’t rob a poor man because he is poor, and don’t crush the oppressed at the gate,
{22:23} for the Lord will take up their case and will plunder those who plunder them.
{22:24} Don’t make friends with an angry man, and don’t be a companion of a hot-tempered man,
{22:25} or you will learn his ways and entangle yourself in a snare.
{22:26} Don’t be one of those who enter agreements, who put up security for loans.
{22:27} If you have no money to pay, even your bed will be taken from under you.
{22:28} Don’t move an ancient boundary marker that your fathers set up.
{22:29} Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand in the presence of kings. He will not stand in the presence of unknown men.
{23:1} When you sit down to dine with a ruler, consider carefully what is before you,
{23:2} and put a knife to your throat if you have a big appetite;
{23:3} don’t desire his choice food, for that food is deceptive.
{23:4} Don’t wear yourself out to get rich; stop giving your attention to it.
{23:5} As soon as your eyes fly to it, it disappears, for it makes wings for itself and flies like an eagle to the sky.
{23:6} Don’t eat a stingy person’s bread, and don’t desire his choice food,
{23:7} for it’s like someone calculating inwardly. “Eat and drink,” he says to you, but his heart is not with you.
{23:8} You will vomit the little you’ve eaten and waste your pleasant words.
{23:9} Don’t speak to a fool, for he will despise the insight of your words.
{23:10} Don’t move an ancient boundary marker, and don’t encroach on the fields of the fatherless,
{23:11} for their Redeemer is strong, and He will take up their case against you.
{23:12} Apply yourself to discipline and listen to words of knowledge.
{23:13} Don’t withhold discipline from a youth; if you beat him with a rod, he will not die.
{23:14} Strike him with a rod, and you will rescue his life from Sheol.
{23:15} My son, if your heart is wise, my heart will indeed rejoice.
{23:16} My innermost being will cheer when your lips say what is right.
{23:17} Don’t let your heart envy sinners; instead, always fear the Lord.
{23:18} For then you will have a future, and your hope will never fade.
{23:19} Listen, my son, and be wise; keep your mind on the right course.
{23:20} Don’t associate with those who drink too much wine or with those who gorge themselves on meat.
{23:21} For the drunkard and the glutton will become poor, and grogginess will clothe them in rags.
{23:22} Listen to your father who gave you life, and don’t despise your mother when she is old.
{23:23} Buy — and do not sell — truth, wisdom, instruction, and understanding.
{23:24} The father of a righteous son will rejoice greatly, and one who fathers a wise son will delight in him.
{23:25} Let your father and mother have joy, and let her who gave birth to you rejoice.
{23:26} My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways.
{23:27} For a prostitute is a deep pit, and a stranger is a narrow well;
{23:28} indeed, she sets an ambush like a robber and increases those among men who are unfaithful.
{23:29} Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has conflicts? Who has complaints? Who has wounds for no reason? Who has red eyes?
{23:30} Those who linger over wine, those who go looking for mixed wine.
{23:31} Don’t gaze at wine because it is red, when it gleams in the cup and goes down smoothly.
{23:32} In the end it bites like a snake and stings like a viper.
{23:33} Your eyes will see strange things, and you will say absurd things.
{23:34} You’ll be like someone sleeping out at sea or lying down on the top of a ship’s mast.
{23:35} “They struck me, but I feel no pain! They beat me, but I didn’t know it! When will I wake up? I’ll look for another drink.”
{24:1} Don’t envy evil men or desire to be with them,
{24:2} for their hearts plan violence, and their words stir up trouble.
{24:3} A house is built by wisdom, and it is established by understanding;
{24:4} by knowledge the rooms are filled with every precious and beautiful treasure.
{24:5} A wise warrior is better than a strong one, and a man of knowledge than one of strength;
{24:6} for you should wage war with sound guidance — victory comes with many counselors.
{24:7} Wisdom is inaccessible to a fool; he does not open his mouth at the gate.
{24:8} The one who plots evil will be called a schemer.
{24:9} A foolish scheme is sin, and a mocker is detestable to people.
{24:10} If you do nothing in a difficult time, your strength is limited.
{24:11} Rescue those being taken off to death, and save those stumbling toward slaughter.
{24:12} If you say, “But we didn’t know about this,” won’t He who weighs hearts consider it? Won’t He who protects your life know? Won’t He repay a person according to his work?
{24:13} Eat honey, my son, for it is good, and the honeycomb is sweet to your palate;
{24:14} realize that wisdom is the same for you. If you find it, you will have a future, and your hope will never fade.
{24:15} Wicked man, don’t set an ambush, at the camp of the righteous man; don’t destroy his dwelling.
{24:16} Though a righteous man falls seven times, he will get up, but the wicked will stumble into ruin.
{24:17} Don’t gloat when your enemy falls, and don’t let your heart rejoice when he stumbles,
{24:18} or the Lord will see, be displeased, and turn His wrath away from him.
{24:19} Don’t be agitated by evildoers, and don’t envy the wicked.
{24:20} For the evil have no future; the lamp of the wicked will be put out.
{24:21} My son, fear the Lord, as well as the king, and don’t associate with rebels,
{24:22} for destruction from them will come suddenly; who knows what distress these two can bring?
{24:23} These sayings also belong to the wise: It is not good to show partiality in judgment.
{24:24} Whoever says to the guilty, “You are innocent” — people will curse him, and tribes will denounce him;
{24:25} but it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and a generous blessing will come to them.
{24:26} He who gives an honest answer gives a kiss on the lips.
{24:27} Complete your outdoor work, and prepare your field; afterward, build your house.
{24:28} Don’t testify against your neighbor without cause. Don’t deceive with your lips.
{24:29} Don’t say, “I’ll do to him what he did to me; I’ll repay the man for what he has done.”
{24:30} I went by the field of a slacker and by the vineyard of a man lacking sense.
{24:31} Thistles had come up everywhere, weeds covered the ground, and the stone wall was ruined.
{24:32} I saw, and took it to heart; I looked, and received instruction:
{24:33} a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to rest,
{24:34} and your poverty will come like a robber, your need, like a bandit.
{i25:1} Hezekiah’s Collection
{25:1} These too are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah, copied.
{25:2} It is the glory of God to conceal a matter and the glory of kings to investigate a matter.
{25:3} As the heaven is high and the earth is deep, so the hearts of kings cannot be investigated.
{25:4} Remove impurities from silver, and a vessel will be produced for a silversmith.
{25:5} Remove the wicked from the king’s presence, and his throne will be established in righteousness.
{25:6} Don’t brag about yourself before the king, and don’t stand in the place of the great;
{25:7} for it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here!” than to demote you in plain view of a noble.
{25:8} Don’t take a matter to court hastily. Otherwise, what will you do afterward if your opponent humiliates you?
{25:9} Make your case with your opponent without revealing another’s secret;
{25:10} otherwise, the one who hears will disgrace you, and you’ll never live it down.
{25:11} A word spoken at the right time is like gold apples on a silver tray.
{25:12} A wise correction to a receptive ear is like a gold ring or an ornament of gold.
{25:13} To those who send him, a trustworthy messenger is like the coolness of snow on a harvest day; he refreshes the life of his masters.
{25:14} The man who boasts about a gift that does not exist is like clouds and wind without rain.
{25:15} A ruler can be persuaded through patience, and a gentle tongue can break a bone.
{25:16} If you find honey, eat only what you need; otherwise, you’ll get sick from it and vomit.
{25:17} Seldom set foot in your neighbor’s house; otherwise, he’ll get sick of you and hate you.
{25:18} A man giving false testimony against his neighbor is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow.
{25:19} Trusting an unreliable person in a difficult time is like a rotten tooth or a faltering foot.
{25:20} Singing songs to a troubled heart is like taking off clothing on a cold day or like pouring vinegar on soda.
{25:21} If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink;
{25:22} for you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you.
{25:23} The north wind produces rain, and a backbiting tongue, angry looks.
{25:24} Better to live on the corner of a roof than to share a house with a nagging wife.
{25:25} Good news from a distant land is like cold water to a parched throat.
{25:26} A righteous person who yields to the wicked is like a muddied spring or a polluted well.
{25:27} It is not good to eat too much honey or to seek glory after glory.
{25:28} A man who does not control his temper is like a city whose wall is broken down.
{26:1} Like snow in summer and rain at harvest, honor is inappropriate for a fool.
{26:2} Like a flitting sparrow or a fluttering swallow, an undeserved curse goes nowhere.
{26:3} A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools.
{26:4} Don’t answer a fool according to his foolishness or you’ll be like him yourself.
{26:5} Answer a fool according to his foolishness or he’ll become wise in his own eyes.
{26:6} The one who sends a message by a fool’s hand cuts off his own feet and drinks violence.
{26:7} A proverb in the mouth of a fool is like lame legs that hang limp.
{26:8} Giving honor to a fool is like binding a stone in a sling.
{26:9} A proverb in the mouth of a fool is like a stick with thorns, brandished by the hand of a drunkard.
{26:10} The one who hires a fool or who hires those passing by is like an archer who wounds everyone.
{26:11} As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his foolishness.
{26:12} Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
{26:13} The slacker says, “There’s a lion in the road — a lion in the public square!”
{26:14} A door turns on its hinges, and a slacker, on his bed.
{26:15} The slacker buries his hand in the bowl; he is too weary to bring it to his mouth.
{26:16} In his own eyes, a slacker is wiser than seven men who can answer sensibly.
{26:17} A person who is passing by and meddles in a quarrel that’s not his is like one who grabs a dog by the ears.
{26:18} Like a madman who throws flaming darts and deadly arrows,
{26:19} so is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, “I was only joking!”
{26:20} Without wood, fire goes out; without a gossip, conflict dies down.
{26:21} As charcoal for embers and wood for fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife.
{26:22} A gossip’s words are like choice food that goes down to one’s innermost being.
{26:23} Smooth lips with an evil heart are like glaze on an earthen vessel.
{26:24} A hateful person disguises himself with his speech and harbors deceit within.
{26:25} When he speaks graciously, don’t believe him, for there are seven abominations in his heart.
{26:26} Though his hatred is concealed by deception, his evil will be revealed in the assembly.
{26:27} The one who digs a pit will fall into it, and whoever rolls a stone — it will come back on him.
{26:28} A lying tongue hates those it crushes, and a flattering mouth causes ruin.
{27:1} Don’t boast about tomorrow, for you don’t know what a day might bring.
{27:2} Let another praise you, and not your own mouth — a stranger, and not your own lips.
{27:3} A stone is heavy and sand, a burden, but aggravation from a fool outweighs them both.
{27:4} Fury is cruel, and anger a flood, but who can withstand jealousy?
{27:5} Better an open reprimand than concealed love.
{27:6} The wounds of a friend are trustworthy, but the kisses of an enemy are excessive.
{27:7} A person who is full tramples on a honeycomb, but to a hungry person, any bitter thing is sweet.
{27:8} A man wandering from his home is like a bird wandering from its nest.
{27:9} Oil and incense bring joy to the heart, and the sweetness of a friend is better than self-counsel.
{27:10} Don’t abandon your friend or your father’s friend, and don’t go to your brother’s house in your time of calamity; better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.
{27:11} Be wise, my son, and bring my heart joy, so that I can answer anyone who taunts me.
{27:12} A sensible person sees danger and takes cover; the inexperienced keep going and are punished.
{27:13} Take his garment, for he has put up security for a stranger; get collateral if it is for foreigners.
{27:14} If one blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, it will be counted as a curse to him.
{27:15} An endless dripping on a rainy day and a nagging wife are alike.
{27:16} The one who controls her controls the wind and grasps oil with his right hand.
{27:17} Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another.
{27:18} Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and whoever looks after his master will be honored.
{27:19} As water reflects the face, so the heart reflects the person.
{27:20} Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, and people’s eyes are never satisfied.
{27:21} A crucible for silver, and a smelter for gold, and a man for the words of his praise.
{27:22} Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain, you will not separate his foolishness from him.
{27:23} Know well the condition of your flock, and pay attention to your herds,
{27:24} for wealth is not forever; not even a crown lasts for all time.
{27:25} When hay is removed and new growth appears and the grain from the hills is gathered in,
{27:26} lambs will provide your clothing, and goats, the price of a field;
{27:27} there will be enough goat’s milk for your food — food for your household and nourishment for your female servants.
{28:1} The wicked flee when no one is pursuing them, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.
{28:2} When a land is in rebellion, it has many rulers, but with a discerning and knowledgeable person, it endures.
{28:3} A destitute leader who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no food.
{28:4} Those who reject the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law battle against them.
{28:5} Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek the Lord understand everything.
{28:6} Better a poor man who lives with integrity than a rich man who distorts right and wrong.
{28:7} A discerning son keeps the law, but a companion of gluttons humiliates his father.
{28:8} Whoever increases his wealth through excessive interest collects it for one who is kind to the poor.
{28:9} Anyone who turns his ear away from hearing the law — even his prayer is detestable.
{28:10} The one who leads the upright into an evil way will fall into his own pit, but the blameless will inherit what is good.
{28:11} A rich man is wise in his own eyes, but a poor man who has discernment sees through him.
{28:12} When the righteous triumph, there is great rejoicing, but when the wicked come to power, people hide themselves.
{28:13} The one who conceals his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them will find mercy.
{28:14} Happy is the one who is always reverent, but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.
{28:15} A wicked ruler over a helpless people is like a roaring lion or a charging bear.
{28:16} A leader who lacks understanding is very oppressive, but one who hates dishonest profit prolongs his life.
{28:17} A man burdened by bloodguilt will be a fugitive until death. Let no one help him.
{28:18} The one who lives with integrity will be helped, but one who distorts right and wrong will suddenly fall.
{28:19} The one who works his land will have plenty of food, but whoever chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.
{28:20} A faithful man will have many blessings, but one in a hurry to get rich will not go unpunished.
{28:21} It is not good to show partiality — yet a man may sin for a piece of bread.
{28:22} A greedy man is in a hurry for wealth; he doesn’t know that poverty will come to him.
{28:23} One who rebukes a person will later find more favor than one who flatters with his tongue.
{28:24} The one who robs his father or mother and says, “That’s no sin,” is a companion to a man who destroys.
{28:25} A greedy person provokes conflict, but whoever trusts in the Lord will prosper.
{28:26} The one who trusts in himself is a fool, but one who walks in wisdom will be safe.
{28:27} The one who gives to the poor will not be in need, but one who turns his eyes away will receive many curses.
{28:28} When the wicked come to power, people hide, but when they are destroyed, the righteous flourish.
{29:1} One who becomes stiff-necked, after many reprimands will be shattered instantly — beyond recovery.
{29:2} When the righteous flourish, the people rejoice, but when the wicked rule, people groan.
{29:3} A man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father, but one who consorts with prostitutes destroys his wealth.
{29:4} By justice a king brings stability to a land, but a man who demands “contributions” demolishes it.
{29:5} A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.
{29:6} An evil man is caught by sin, but the righteous one sings and rejoices.
{29:7} The righteous person knows the rights of the poor, but the wicked one does not understand these concerns.
{29:8} Mockers inflame a city, but the wise turn away anger.
{29:9} If a wise man goes to court with a fool, there will be ranting and raving but no resolution.
{29:10} Bloodthirsty men hate an honest person, but the upright care about him.
{29:11} A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise man holds it in check.
{29:12} If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials will be wicked.
{29:13} The poor and the oppressor have this in common: the Lord gives light to the eyes of both.
{29:14} A king who judges the poor with fairness — his throne will be established forever.
{29:15} A rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a youth left to himself is a disgrace to his mother.
{29:16} When the wicked increase, rebellion increases, but the righteous will see their downfall.
{29:17} Discipline your son, and it will bring you peace of mind and give you delight.
{29:18} Without revelation people run wild, but one who listens to instruction will be happy.
{29:19} A slave cannot be disciplined by words; though he understands, he doesn’t respond.
{29:20} Do you see a man who speaks too soon? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
{29:21} A slave pampered from his youth will become arrogant later on.
{29:22} An angry man stirs up conflict, and a hot-tempered man increases rebellion.
{29:23} A person’s pride will humble him, but a humble spirit will gain honor.
{29:24} To be a thief’s partner is to hate oneself; he hears the curse but will not testify.
{29:25} The fear of man is a snare, but the one who trusts in the Lord is protected.
{29:26} Many seek a ruler’s favor, but a man receives justice from the Lord.
{29:27} An unjust man is detestable to the righteous, and one whose way is upright is detestable to the wicked.
{i30:1} The Words of Agur
{30:1} The words of Agur son of Jakeh. The oracle. The man’s oration to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:
{30:2} I am more stupid than any other man, and I lack man’s ability to understand.
{30:3} I have not gained wisdom, and I have no knowledge of the Holy One.
{30:4} Who has gone up to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in His hands? Who has bound up the waters in a cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name, and what is the name of His Son — if you know?
{30:5} Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.
{30:6} Don’t add to His words, or He will rebuke you, and you will be proved a liar.
{30:7} Two things I ask of You; don’t deny them to me before I die:
{30:8} Keep falsehood and deceitful words far from me. Give me neither poverty nor wealth; feed me with the food I need.
{30:9} Otherwise, I might have too much and deny You, saying, “Who is the Lord?” or I might have nothing and steal, profaning the name of my God.
{30:10} Don’t slander a servant to his master or he will curse you, and you will become guilty.
{30:11} There is a generation that curses its father and does not bless its mother.
{30:12} There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes, yet is not washed from its filth.
{30:13} There is a generation — how haughty its eyes and pretentious its looks.
{30:14} There is a generation whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, devouring the oppressed from the land and the needy from among mankind.
{30:15} The leech has two daughters: “Give, Give!” Three things are never satisfied; four never say, “Enough!”:
{30:16} Sheol; a childless womb; earth, which is never satisfied with water; and fire, which never says, “Enough!”
{30:17} As for the eye that ridicules a father and despises obedience to a mother, may ravens of the valley pluck it out and young vultures eat it.
{30:18} Three things are beyond me; four I can’t understand:
{30:19} the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship at sea, and the way of a man with a young woman.
{30:20} This is the way of an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, “I’ve done nothing wrong.”
{30:21} The earth trembles under three things; it cannot bear up under four:
{30:22} a servant when he becomes king, a fool when he is stuffed with food,
{30:23} an unloved woman when she marries, and a servant girl when she ousts her queen.
{30:24} Four things on earth are small, yet they are extremely wise:
{30:25} the ants are not a strong people, yet they store up their food in the summer;
{30:26} hyraxes are not a mighty people, yet they make their homes in the cliffs;
{30:27} locusts have no king, yet all of them march in ranks;
{30:28} a lizard can be caught in your hands, yet it lives in kings’ palaces.
{30:29} Three things are stately in their stride, even four are stately in their walk:
{30:30} a lion, which is mightiest among beasts and doesn’t retreat before anything,
{30:31} a strutting rooster, a goat, and a king at the head of his army.
{30:32} If you have been foolish by exalting yourself or if you’ve been scheming, put your hand over your mouth.
{30:33} For the churning of milk produces butter, and twisting a nose draws blood, and stirring up anger produces strife.
{i31:1} The Words of Lemuel
{31:1} The words of King Lemuel, an oracle that his mother taught him:
{31:2} What should I say, my son? What, son of my womb? What, son of my vows?
{31:3} Don’t spend your energy on women or your efforts on those who destroy kings.
{31:4} It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine or for rulers to desire beer.
{31:5} Otherwise, they will drink, forget what is decreed, and pervert justice for all the oppressed.
{31:6} Give beer to one who is dying and wine to one whose life is bitter.
{31:7} Let him drink so that he can forget his poverty and remember his trouble no more.
{31:8} Speak up for those who have no voice, for the justice of all who are dispossessed.
{31:9} Speak up, judge righteously, and defend the cause of the oppressed and needy.
{i31:10} In Praise of a Capable Wife
{31:10} Who can find a capable wife? She is far more precious than jewels.
{31:11} The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will not lack anything good.
{31:12} She rewards him with good, not evil, all the days of her life.
{31:13} She selects wool and flax and works with willing hands.
{31:14} She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from far away.
{31:15} She rises while it is still night and provides food for her household and portions for her female servants.
{31:16} She evaluates a field and buys it; she plants a vineyard with her earnings.
{31:17} She draws on her strength and reveals that her arms are strong.
{31:18} She sees that her profits are good, and her lamp never goes out at night.
{31:19} She extends her hands to the spinning staff, and her hands hold the spindle.
{31:20} Her hands reach out to the poor, and she extends her hands to the needy.
{31:21} She is not afraid for her household when it snows, for all in her household are doubly clothed.
{31:22} She makes her own bed coverings; her clothing is fine linen and purple.
{31:23} Her husband is known at the city gates, where he sits among the elders of the land.
{31:24} She makes and sells linen garments; she delivers belts to the merchants.
{31:25} Strength and honor are her clothing, and she can laugh at the time to come.
{31:26} She opens her mouth with wisdom and loving instruction is on her tongue.
{31:27} She watches over the activities of her household and is never idle.
{31:28} Her sons rise up and call her blessed. Her husband also praises her:
{31:29} “Many women are capable, but you surpass them all!”
{31:30} Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord will be praised.
{31:31} Give her the reward of her labor, and let her works praise her at the city gates.
