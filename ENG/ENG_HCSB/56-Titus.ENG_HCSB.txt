{i1:1} Greeting
{1:1} Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to build up the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,
{1:2} in the hope of eternal life that God, who cannot lie, promised before time began.
{1:3} In His own time He has revealed His message in the proclamation that I was entrusted with by the command of God our Savior:
{1:4} To Titus, my true son in our common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
{i1:5} Titus’s Ministry in Crete
{1:5} The reason I left you in Crete was to set right what was left undone and, as I directed you, to appoint elders in every town:
{1:6} one who is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of wildness or rebellion.
{1:7} For an overseer, as God’s administrator, must be blameless, not arrogant, not hot-tempered, not addicted to wine, not a bully, not greedy for money,
{1:8} but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, righteous, holy, self-controlled,
{1:9} holding to the faithful message as taught, so that he will be able both to encourage with sound teaching and to refute those who contradict it.
{1:10} For there are also many rebellious people, full of empty talk and deception, especially those from Judaism.
{1:11} It is necessary to silence them; they overthrow whole households by teaching what they shouldn’t in order to get money dishonestly.
{1:12} One of their very own prophets said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.
{1:13} This testimony is true. So, rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith
{1:14} and may not pay attention to Jewish myths and the commands of men who reject the truth.
{1:15} To the pure, everything is pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; in fact, both their mind and conscience are defiled.
{1:16} They profess to know God, but they deny Him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, and disqualified for any good work.
{i2:1} Sound Teaching and Christian Living
{2:1} But you must say the things that are consistent with sound teaching.
{2:2} Older men are to be level headed, worthy of respect, sensible, and sound in faith, love, and endurance.
{2:3} In the same way, older women are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not addicted to much wine. They are to teach what is good,
{2:4} so they may encourage the young women to love their husbands and to love their children,
{2:5} to be self-controlled, pure, homemakers, kind, and submissive to their husbands, so that God’s message will not be slandered.
{2:6} In the same way, encourage the young men to be self-controlled
{2:7} in everything. Make yourself an example of good works with integrity and dignity in your teaching.
{2:8} Your message is to be sound beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be ashamed, having nothing bad to say about us.
{2:9} Slaves are to be submissive to their masters in everything, and to be well-pleasing, not talking back
{2:10} or stealing, but demonstrating utter faithfulness, so that they may adorn the teaching of God our Savior in everything.
{2:11} For the grace of God has appeared with salvation for all people,
{2:12} instructing us to deny godlessness and worldly lusts and to live in a sensible, righteous, and godly way in the present age,
{2:13} while we wait for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
{2:14} He gave Himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for Himself a people for His own possession, eager to do good works.
{2:15} Say these things, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
{i3:1} Christian Living among Outsiders
{3:1} Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work,
{3:2} to slander no one, to avoid fighting, and to be kind, always showing gentleness to all people.
{3:3} For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another.
{3:4} But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared,
{3:5} He saved us — not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to His mercy — through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit.
{3:6} He poured out this Spirit on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior
{3:7} so that, having been justified by His grace, we may become heirs with the hope of eternal life.
{3:8} This saying is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed God might be careful to devote themselves to good works. These are good and profitable for everyone.
{3:9} But avoid foolish debates, genealogies, quarrels, and disputes about the law, for they are unprofitable and worthless.
{3:10} Reject a divisive person after a first and second warning,
{3:11} knowing that such a person is perverted and sins, being self-condemned.
{i3:12} Final Instructions and Closing
{3:12} When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
{3:13} Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey, so that they will lack nothing.
{3:14} And our people must also learn to devote themselves to good works for cases of urgent need, so that they will not be unfruitful.
{3:15} All those who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you.
