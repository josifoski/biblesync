{1:1} The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests living in Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.
{1:2} The word of the Lord came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah.
{1:3} It also came throughout the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went into exile.
{i1:4} The Call of Jeremiah
{1:4} The word of the Lord came to me:
{1:5} I chose you before I formed you in the womb; I set you apart before you were born. I appointed you a prophet to the nations.
{1:6} But I protested, “Oh no, Lord, God! Look, I don’t know how to speak since I am only a youth.”
{1:7} Then the Lord said to me: Do not say, “I am only a youth,” for you will go to everyone I send you to and speak whatever I tell you.
{1:8} Do not be afraid of anyone, for I will be with you to deliver you. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{1:9} Then the Lord reached out His hand, touched my mouth, and told me: I have now filled your mouth with My words.
{1:10} See, I have appointed you today over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and demolish, to build and plant.
{i1:11} Two Visions
{1:11} Then the word of the Lord came to me, asking, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I replied, “I see a branch of an almond tree.”
{1:12} The Lord said to me, “You have seen correctly, for I watch over My word to accomplish it.”
{1:13} Again the word of the Lord came to me inquiring, “What do you see?” And I replied, “I see a boiling pot, its lip tilted from the north to the south.”
{1:14} Then the Lord said to me, “Disaster will be poured out from the north on all who live in the land.
{1:15} Indeed, I am about to summon all the clans and kingdoms of the north.” This is the Lord’s declaration. They will come, and each king will set up his throne at the entrance to Jerusalem’s gates. They will attack all her surrounding walls and all the other cities of Judah.
{1:16} “I will pronounce My judgments against them for all the evil they did when they abandoned Me to burn incense to other gods and to worship the works of their own hands.
{1:17} “Now, get ready. Stand up and tell them everything that I command you. Do not be intimidated by them or I will cause you to cower before them.
{1:18} Today, I am the One who has made you a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land — against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the population.
{1:19} They will fight against you but never prevail over you, since I am with you to rescue you.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{i2:1} Israel Accused of Apostasy
{2:1} The word of the Lord came to me:
{2:2} “Go and announce directly to Jerusalem that this is what the Lord says: I remember the loyalty of your youth, your love as a bride — how you followed Me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.
{2:3} Israel was holy to the Lord, the firstfruits of His harvest. All who ate of it found themselves guilty; disaster came on them.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{2:4} Hear the word of the Lord, house of Jacob and all families of the house of Israel.
{2:5} This is what the Lord says: What fault did your fathers find in Me that they went so far from Me, followed worthless idols, and became worthless themselves?
{2:6} They stopped asking, “Where is the Lord who brought us from the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and ravines, through a land of drought and darkness, a land no one traveled through and where no one lived?”
{2:7} I brought you to a fertile land to eat its fruit and bounty, but after you entered, you defiled My land; you made My inheritance detestable.
{2:8} The priests quit asking, “Where is the Lord?” The experts in the law no longer knew Me, and the rulers rebelled against Me. The prophets prophesied by Baal and followed useless idols.
{2:9} Therefore, I will bring a case against you again. This is the Lord’s declaration. I will bring a case against your children’s children.
{2:10} Cross over to Cyprus and take a look. Send someone to Kedar and consider carefully; see if there has ever been anything like this:
{2:11} Has a nation ever exchanged its gods? (But they were not gods! ) Yet My people have exchanged their Glory for useless idols.
{2:12} Be horrified at this, heavens; be shocked and utterly appalled. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{2:13} For My people have committed a double evil: They have abandoned Me, the fountain of living water, and dug cisterns for themselves, cracked cisterns that cannot hold water.
{i2:14} Consequences of Apostasy
{2:14} Is Israel a slave? Was he born into slavery? Why else has he become a prey?
{2:15} The young lions have roared at him; they have roared loudly. They have laid waste his land. His cities are in ruins, without inhabitants.
{2:16} The men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have also broken your skull.
{2:17} Have you not brought this on yourself by abandoning the Lord your God while He was leading you along the way?
{2:18} Now what will you gain by traveling along the way to Egypt to drink the waters of the Nile? What will you gain by traveling along the way to Assyria to drink the waters of the Euphrates?
{2:19} Your own evil will discipline you; your own apostasies will reprimand you. Think it over and see how evil and bitter it is for you to abandon the Lord your God and to have no fear of Me. This is the declaration of the Lord God of Hosts.
{2:20} For long ago I broke your yoke; I tore off your chains. You insisted, “I will not serve!” On every high hill and under every green tree you lie down like a prostitute.
{2:21} I planted you, a choice vine from the very best seed. How then could you turn into a degenerate, foreign vine?
{2:22} Even if you wash with lye and use a great amount of soap, the stain of your sin is still in front of Me. This is the Lord God’s declaration.
{2:23} How can you protest, “I am not defiled; I have not followed the Baals”? Look at your behavior in the valley; acknowledge what you have done. You are a swift young camel twisting and turning on her way,
{2:24} a wild donkey at home in the wilderness. She sniffs the wind in the heat of her desire. Who can control her passion? All who look for her will not become tired; they will find her in her mating season.
{2:25} Keep your feet from going bare and your throat from thirst. But you say, “It’s hopeless; I love strangers, and I will continue to follow them.”
{2:26} Like the shame of a thief when he is caught, so the house of Israel has been put to shame. They, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets
{2:27} say to a tree, “You are my father,” and to a stone, “You gave birth to me.” For they have turned their back to Me and not their face, yet in their time of disaster they beg, “Rise up and save us!”
{2:28} But where are your gods you made for yourself? Let them rise up and save you in your time of disaster if they can, for your gods are as numerous as your cities, Judah.
{i2:29} Judgment Deserved
{2:29} Why do you bring a case against Me? All of you have rebelled against Me. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{2:30} I have struck down your children in vain; they would not accept discipline. Your own sword has devoured your prophets like a ravaging lion.
{2:31} Evil generation, pay attention to the word of the Lord! Have I been a wilderness to Israel or a land of dense darkness? Why do My people claim, “We will go where we want; we will no longer come to You”?
{2:32} Can a young woman forget her jewelry or a bride her wedding sash? Yet My people have forgotten Me for countless days.
{2:33} How skillfully you pursue love; you also teach evil women your ways.
{2:34} Moreover, your skirts are stained with the blood of the innocent poor. You did not catch them breaking and entering. But in spite of all these things
{2:35} you claim, “I am innocent. His anger is sure to turn away from me.” But I will certainly judge you because you have said, “I have not sinned.”
{2:36} How unstable you are, constantly changing your ways! You will be put to shame by Egypt just as you were put to shame by Assyria.
{2:37} Moreover, you will be led out from here with your hands on your head since the Lord has rejected those you trust; you will not succeed even with their help.
{i3:1} Wages of Apostasy
{3:1} If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him to marry another, can he ever return to her? Wouldn’t such a land become totally defiled? But you! You have played the prostitute with many partners — can you return to Me? This is the Lord’s declaration.
{3:2} Look to the barren heights and see. Where have you not been immoral? You sat waiting for them beside the highways like a nomad in the desert. You have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness.
{3:3} This is why the showers haven’t come — why there has been no spring rain. You have the brazen look of a prostitute and refuse to be ashamed.
{3:4} Have you not lately called to Me, “My Father. You were my friend in my youth.
{3:5} Will He bear a grudge forever? Will He be endlessly infuriated?” This is what you have said, but you have done the evil things you are capable of.
{i3:6} Unfaithful Israel, Treacherous Judah
{3:6} In the days of King Josiah the Lord asked me, “Have you seen what unfaithful Israel has done? She has ascended every high hill and gone under every green tree to prostitute herself there.
{3:7} I thought: After she has done all these things, she will return to Me. But she didn’t return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
{3:8} I observed that it was because unfaithful Israel had committed adultery that I had sent her away and had given her a certificate of divorce. Nevertheless, her treacherous sister Judah was not afraid but also went and prostituted herself.
{3:9} Indifferent to her prostitution, she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and trees.
{3:10} Yet in spite of all this, her treacherous sister Judah didn’t return to Me with all her heart — only in pretense.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{3:11} The Lord announced to me, “Unfaithful Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
{3:12} Go, proclaim these words to the north, and say: Return, unfaithful Israel. This is the Lord’s declaration. I will not look on you with anger, for I am unfailing in My love. This is the Lord’s declaration. I will not be angry forever.
{3:13} Only acknowledge your guilt — you have rebelled against the Lord your God. You have scattered your favors to strangers under every green tree and have not obeyed My voice. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{3:14} “Return, you faithless children” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “for I am your master, and I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion.
{3:15} I will give you shepherds who are loyal to Me, and they will shepherd you with knowledge and skill.
{3:16} When you multiply and increase in the land, in those days” — the Lord’s declaration — “no one will say any longer, ‘The ark of the Lord’s covenant.’ It will never come to mind, and no one will remember or miss it. It will never again be made.
{3:17} At that time Jerusalem will be called, Yahweh’s Throne, and all the nations will be gathered to it, to the name of Yahweh in Jerusalem. They will cease to follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts.
{3:18} In those days the house of Judah will join with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of the north to the land I have given your ancestors to inherit.”
{i3:19} True Repentance
{3:19} I thought: How I long to make you My sons and give you a desirable land, the most beautiful inheritance of all the nations. I thought: You will call Me, my Father, and never turn away from Me.
{3:20} However, as a woman may betray her lover, so you have betrayed Me, house of Israel. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{3:21} A sound is heard on the barren heights, the children of Israel weeping and begging for mercy, for they have perverted their way; they have forgotten the Lord their God.
{3:22} Return, you faithless children. I will heal your unfaithfulness. “Here we are, coming to You, for You are the Lord our God.
{3:23} Surely, falsehood comes from the hills, commotion from the mountains, but the salvation of Israel is only in the Lord our God.
{3:24} From the time of our youth the shameful one has consumed what our fathers have worked for — their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
{3:25} Let us lie down in our shame; let our disgrace cover us. We have sinned against the Lord our God, both we and our fathers, from the time of our youth even to this day. We have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.”
{i4:1} Blessing or Curse
{4:1} If you return, Israel — this is the Lord’s declaration — you will return to Me, if you remove your detestable idols from My presence and do not waver,
{4:2} then you can swear, “As the Lord lives,” in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, then the nations will be blessed by Him and will pride themselves in Him.
{4:3} For this is what the Lord says to the men of Judah and Jerusalem: Break up the unplowed ground; do not sow among the thorns.
{4:4} Circumcise yourselves to the Lord; remove the foreskin of your hearts, men of Judah and residents of Jerusalem. Otherwise, My wrath will break out like fire and burn with no one to extinguish it because of your evil deeds.
{i4:5} Judgment from the North
{4:5} Declare in Judah, proclaim in Jerusalem, and say: Blow the ram’s horn throughout the land. Cry out loudly and say: Assemble yourselves, and let’s flee to the fortified cities.
{4:6} Lift up a signal flag toward Zion. Run for cover! Don’t stand still! For I am bringing disaster from the north — a great destruction.
{4:7} A lion has gone up from his thicket; a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his lair to make your land a waste. Your cities will be reduced to uninhabited ruins.
{4:8} Because of this, put on sackcloth; mourn and wail, for the Lord’s burning anger has not turned away from us.
{4:9} “On that day” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “the king and the officials will lose their courage. The priests will tremble in fear, and the prophets will be scared speechless.”
{4:10} I said, “Oh no, Lord God, You have certainly deceived this people and Jerusalem, by announcing, ‘You will have peace,’ while a sword is at our throats.”
{4:11} “At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, ‘A searing wind blows from the barren heights in the wilderness on the way to My dear people. It comes not to winnow or to sift;
{4:12} a wind too strong for this comes at My call. Now I will also pronounce judgments against them.’”
{4:13} Look, he advances like clouds; his chariots are like a storm. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, for we are ruined!
{4:14} Wash the evil from your heart, Jerusalem, so that you will be delivered. How long will you harbor malicious thoughts within you?
{4:15} For a voice announces from Dan, proclaiming malice from Mount Ephraim.
{4:16} Warn the nations: Look! Proclaim to Jerusalem: Those who besiege are coming from a distant land; they raise their voices against the cities of Judah.
{4:17} They have her surrounded like those who guard a field, because she has rebelled against Me. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{4:18} Your way of life and your actions have brought this on you. This is your punishment. It is very bitter, because it has reached your heart!
{i4:19} Jeremiah’s Lament
{4:19} My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in agony! Oh, the pain in my heart! My heart pounds; I cannot be silent. For you, my soul, have heard the sound of the ram’s horn — the shout of battle.
{4:20} Disaster after disaster is reported because the whole land is destroyed. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, my tent curtains, in a moment.
{4:21} How long must I see the signal flag and hear the sound of the ram’s horn?
{4:22} “For My people are fools; they do not know Me. They are foolish children, without understanding. They are skilled in doing what is evil, but they do not know how to do what is good.”
{4:23} I looked at the earth, and it was formless and empty. I looked to the heavens, and their light was gone.
{4:24} I looked at the mountains, and they were quaking; all the hills shook.
{4:25} I looked, and no man was left; all the birds of the sky had fled.
{4:26} I looked, and the fertile field was a wilderness. All its cities were torn down because of the Lord and His burning anger.
{4:27} For this is what the Lord says: The whole land will be a desolation, but I will not finish it off.
{4:28} Because of this, the earth will mourn; the skies above will grow dark. I have spoken; I have planned, and I will not relent or turn back from it.
{4:29} Every city flees at the sound of the horseman and the archer. They enter the thickets and climb among the rocks. Every city is abandoned; no inhabitant is left.
{4:30} And you, devastated one, what are you doing that you dress yourself in scarlet, that you adorn yourself with gold jewelry, that you enlarge your eyes with paint? You beautify yourself for nothing. Your lovers reject you; they want to take your life.
{4:31} I hear a cry like a woman in labor, a cry of anguish like one bearing her first child. The cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands: Woe is me, for my life is weary because of the murderers!
{i5:1} The Depravity of Jerusalem
{5:1} Roam through the streets of Jerusalem. Look and take note; search in her squares. If you find one person, any who acts justly, who seeks to be faithful, then I will forgive her.
{5:2} When they say, “As the Lord lives,” they are swearing falsely.
{5:3} Lord, don’t Your eyes look for faithfulness? You have struck them, but they felt no pain. You finished them off, but they refused to accept discipline. They made their faces harder than rock, and they refused to return.
{5:4} Then I thought: They are just the poor; they have played the fool. For they don’t understand the way of the Lord, the justice of their God.
{5:5} I will go to the powerful and speak to them. Surely they know the way of the Lord, the justice of their God. However, these also had broken the yoke and torn off the chains.
{5:6} Therefore, a lion from the forest will strike them down. A wolf from an arid plain will ravage them. A leopard keeps watch over their cities. Anyone who leaves them will be torn to pieces because their rebellious acts are many, their unfaithful deeds numerous.
{5:7} Why should I forgive you? Your children have abandoned Me and sworn by those who are not gods. I satisfied their needs, yet they committed adultery; they gashed themselves at the prostitute’s house.
{5:8} They are well-fed, eager stallions, each neighing after someone else’s wife.
{5:9} Should I not punish them for these things? This is the Lord’s declaration. Should I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?
{5:10} Go up among her vineyard terraces and destroy them, but do not finish them off. Prune away her shoots, for they do not belong to the Lord.
{5:11} They, the house of Israel and the house of Judah, have dealt very treacherously with Me. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{5:12} They have contradicted the Lord and insisted, “It won’t happen. Harm won’t come to us; we won’t see sword or famine.”
{5:13} The prophets become only wind, for the Lord’s word is not in them. This will in fact happen to them.
{i5:14} Coming Judgment
{5:14} Therefore, this is what the Lord God of Hosts says: Because you have spoken this word, I am going to make My words become fire in your mouth. These people are the wood, and the fire will consume them.
{5:15} I am about to bring a nation from far away against you, house of Israel. This is the Lord’s declaration. It is an established nation, an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know and whose speech you do not understand.
{5:16} Their quiver is like an open grave; they are all mighty warriors.
{5:17} They will consume your harvest and your food. They will consume your sons and your daughters. They will consume your flocks and your herds. They will consume your vines and your fig trees. They will destroy with the sword your fortified cities in which you trust.
{5:18} “But even in those days” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “I will not finish you off.
{5:19} When people ask, ‘For what offense has the Lord our God done all these things to us?’ You will respond to them: Just as you abandoned Me and served foreign gods in your land, so will you serve strangers in a land that is not yours.
{5:20} “Declare this in the house of Jacob; proclaim it in Judah, saying:
{5:21} Hear this, you foolish and senseless people. They have eyes, but they don’t see. They have ears, but they don’t hear.
{5:22} Do you not fear Me? This is the Lord’s declaration. Do you not tremble before Me, the One who set the sand as the boundary of the sea, an enduring barrier that it cannot cross? The waves surge, but they cannot prevail. They roar but cannot pass over it.
{5:23} But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts. They have turned aside and have gone away.
{5:24} They have not said to themselves, ‘Let’s fear the Lord our God, who gives the rain, both early and late, in its season, who guarantees to us the fixed weeks of the harvest.’
{5:25} Your guilty acts have diverted these things from you. Your sins have withheld My bounty from you,
{5:26} for wicked men live among My people. They watch like fowlers lying in wait. They set a trap; they catch men.
{5:27} Like a cage full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit. Therefore they have grown powerful and rich.
{5:28} They have become fat and sleek. They have also excelled in evil matters. They have not taken up cases, such as the case of the fatherless, so they might prosper, and they have not defended the rights of the needy.
{5:29} Should I not punish them for these things? This is the Lord’s declaration. Should I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?
{5:30} A horrible, terrible thing has taken place in the land.
{5:31} The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule by their own authority. My people love it like this. But what will you do at the end of it?
{i6:1} Threatened Siege of Jerusalem
{6:1} “Run for cover, Benjaminites, out of Jerusalem! Sound the ram’s horn in Tekoa; raise a smoke signal over Beth-haccherem, for disaster threatens from the north, even great destruction.
{6:2} Though she is beautiful and delicate, I will destroy Daughter Zion.
{6:3} Shepherds and their flocks will come against her; they will pitch their tents all around her. Each will pasture his own portion.
{6:4} Set them apart for war against her; rise up, let’s attack at noon. Woe to us, for the day is passing; the evening shadows grow long.
{6:5} Rise up, let’s attack by night. Let us destroy her fortresses.”
{6:6} For this is what the Lord of Hosts says: Cut down the trees; raise a siege ramp against Jerusalem. This city must be punished. There is nothing but oppression within her.
{6:7} As a well gushes out its water, so she pours out her evil. Violence and destruction resound in her. Sickness and wounds keep coming to My attention.
{6:8} Be warned, Jerusalem, or I will turn away from you; I will make you a desolation, a land without inhabitants.
{i6:9} Wrath on Israel
{6:9} This is what the Lord of Hosts says: Glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as a vine. Pass your hand once more like a grape gatherer over the branches.
{6:10} Who can I speak to and give such a warning that they will listen? Look, their ear is uncircumcised, so they cannot pay attention. See, the word of the Lord has become contemptible to them — they find no pleasure in it.
{6:11} But I am full of the Lord’s wrath; I am tired of holding it back. Pour it out on the children in the street, on the gang of young men as well. For both husband and wife will be captured, the old with the very old.
{6:12} Their houses will be turned over to others, their fields and wives as well, for I will stretch out My hand against the inhabitants of the land. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{6:13} For from the least to the greatest of them, everyone is making profit dishonestly. From prophet to priest, everyone deals falsely.
{6:14} They have treated My people’s brokenness superficially, claiming, “Peace, peace,” when there is no peace.
{6:15} Were they ashamed when they acted so abhorrently? They weren’t at all ashamed. They can no longer feel humiliation. Therefore, they will fall among the fallen. When I punish them, they will collapse, says the Lord.
{i6:16} Disaster because of Disobedience
{6:16} This is what the Lord says: Stand by the roadways and look. Ask about the ancient paths: Which is the way to what is good? Then take it and find rest for yourselves. But they protested, “We won’t!”
{6:17} I appointed watchmen over you and said: Listen for the sound of the ram’s horn. But they protested, “We won’t listen!”
{6:18} Therefore listen, you nations and you witnesses, learn what the charge is against them.
{6:19} Listen, earth! I am about to bring disaster on these people, the fruit of their own plotting, for they have paid no attention to My word. They have rejected My instruction.
{6:20} What use to Me is frankincense from Sheba or sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable; your sacrifices do not please Me.
{6:21} Therefore, this is what the Lord says: I am going to place stumbling blocks before these people; fathers and sons together will stumble over them; friends and neighbors will also perish.
{i6:22} A Cruel Nation from the North
{6:22} This is what the Lord says: Look, an army is coming from a northern land; a great nation will be awakened from the remote regions of the earth.
{6:23} They grasp bow and javelin. They are cruel and show no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, lined up like men in battle formation against you, Daughter Zion.
{6:24} We have heard about it, and we are discouraged. Distress has seized us — pain like a woman in labor.
{6:25} Don’t go out to the fields; don’t walk on the road. For the enemy has a sword; terror is on every side.
{6:26} My dear people, dress yourselves in sackcloth and roll in the dust. Mourn as you would for an only son, a bitter lament, for suddenly the destroyer will come on us.
{i6:27} Jeremiah Appointed as an Examiner
{6:27} I have appointed you to be an assayer among My people — a refiner — so you may know and assay their way of life.
{6:28} All are stubborn rebels spreading slander. They are bronze and iron; all of them are corrupt.
{6:29} The bellows blow, blasting the lead with fire. The refining is completely in vain; the evil ones are not separated out.
{6:30} They are called rejected silver, for the Lord has rejected them.
{i7:1} False Trust in the Temple
{7:1} This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
{7:2} “Stand in the gate of the house of the Lord and there call out this word: Hear the word of the Lord, all you people of Judah who enter through these gates to worship the Lord.
{7:3} “This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Correct your ways and your deeds, and I will allow you to live in this place.
{7:4} Do not trust deceitful words, chanting: This is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.
{7:5} Instead, if you really change your ways and your actions, if you act justly toward one another,
{7:6} if you no longer oppress the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow and no longer shed innocent blood in this place or follow other gods, bringing harm on yourselves,
{7:7} I will allow you to live in this place, the land I gave to your ancestors long ago and forever.
{7:8} But look, you keep trusting in deceitful words that cannot help.
{7:9} “Do you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and follow other gods that you have not known?
{7:10} Then do you come and stand before Me in this house called by My name and say, ‘We are delivered, so we can continue doing all these detestable acts’?
{7:11} Has this house, which is called by My name, become a den of robbers in your view? Yes, I too have seen it.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{i7:12} Shiloh As a Warning
{7:12} “But return to My place that was at Shiloh, where I made My name dwell at first. See what I did to it because of the evil of My people Israel.
{7:13} Now, because you have done all these things” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “and because I have spoken to you time and time again but you wouldn’t listen, and I have called to you, but you wouldn’t answer,
{7:14} what I did to Shiloh I will do to the house that is called by My name — the house in which you trust — the place that I gave you and your ancestors.
{7:15} I will drive you from My presence, just as I drove out all of your brothers, all the descendants of Ephraim.
{i7:16} Do Not Pray for Judah
{7:16} “As for you, do not pray for these people. Do not offer a cry or a prayer on their behalf, and do not beg Me, for I will not listen to you.
{7:17} Don’t you see how they behave in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
{7:18} The sons gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead dough to make cakes for the queen of heaven, and they pour out drink offerings to other gods so that they provoke Me to anger.
{7:19} But are they really provoking Me?” This is the Lord’s declaration. “Isn’t it they themselves being provoked to disgrace?”
{7:20} Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: “Look, My anger — My burning wrath — is about to be poured out on this place, on man and beast, on the tree of the field, and on the produce of the land. My wrath will burn and not be quenched.”
{i7:21} Obedience Over Sacrifice
{7:21} This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices, and eat the meat yourselves,
{7:22} for when I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak with them or command them concerning burnt offering and sacrifice.
{7:23} However, I did give them this command: Obey Me, and then I will be your God, and you will be My people. You must follow every way I command you so that it may go well with you.
{7:24} Yet they didn’t listen or pay attention but followed their own advice and according to their own stubborn, evil heart. They went backward and not forward.
{7:25} Since the day your ancestors came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent all My servants the prophets to you time and time again.
{7:26} However, they wouldn’t listen to Me or pay attention but became obstinate; they did more evil than their ancestors.
{i7:27} A Lament for Disobedient Judah
{7:27} “When you speak all these things to them, they will not listen to you. When you call to them, they will not answer you.
{7:28} You must therefore declare to them: This is the nation that would not listen to the voice of the Lord their God and would not accept discipline. Truth has perished — it has disappeared from their mouths.
{7:29} Cut off the hair of your sacred vow and throw it away. Raise up a dirge on the barren heights, for the Lord has rejected and abandoned the generation under His wrath.
{7:30} “For the Judeans have done what is evil in My sight.” This is the Lord’s declaration. “They have set up their detestable things in the house that is called by My name and defiled it.
{7:31} They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom in order to burn their sons and daughters in the fire, a thing I did not command; I never entertained the thought.
{7:32} “Therefore, take note! Days are coming” — the Lord’s declaration — “when this place will no longer be called Topheth and the Valley of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. Topheth will become a cemetery, because there will be no other burial place.
{7:33} The corpses of these people will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the land, with no one to scare them away.
{7:34} I will remove from the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem the sound of joy and gladness and the voices of the groom and the bride, for the land will become a desolate waste.
{i8:1} Death over Life
{8:1} “At that time” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of her officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the residents of Jerusalem will be brought out of their graves.
{8:2} They will be exposed to the sun, the moon, and the whole heavenly host, which they have loved, served, followed, consulted, and worshiped. Their bones will not be collected and buried but will become like manure on the surface of the soil.
{8:3} Death will be chosen over life by all the survivors of this evil family, those who remain wherever I have banished them.” This is the declaration of the Lord of Hosts.
{8:4} “You are to say to them: This is what the Lord says: Do people fall and not get up again? If they turn away, do they not return?
{8:5} Why have these people turned away? Why is Jerusalem always turning away? They take hold of deceit; they refuse to return.
{8:6} I have paid careful attention. They do not speak what is right. No one regrets his evil, asking, ‘What have I done?’ Everyone has stayed his course like a horse rushing into battle.
{8:7} Even the stork in the sky knows her seasons. The turtledove, swallow, and crane are aware of their migration, but My people do not know the requirements of the Lord.
{i8:8} Punishment for Judah’s Leaders
{8:8} “How can you claim, ‘We are wise; the law of the Lord is with us’? In fact, the lying pen of scribes has produced falsehood.
{8:9} The wise will be put to shame; they will be dismayed and snared. They have rejected the word of the Lord, so what wisdom do they really have?
{8:10} Therefore, I will give their wives to other men, their fields to new occupants, for from the least to the greatest, everyone is making profit dishonestly. From prophet to priest, everyone deals falsely.
{8:11} They have treated superficially the brokenness of My dear people, claiming, ‘Peace, peace,’ when there is no peace.
{8:12} Were they ashamed when they acted so abhorrently? They weren’t at all ashamed. They can no longer feel humiliation. Therefore, they will fall among the fallen. When I punish them, they will collapse,” says the Lord.
{8:13} I will gather them and bring them to an end. This is the Lord’s declaration. There will be no grapes on the vine, no figs on the fig tree, and even the leaf will wither. Whatever I have given them will be lost to them.
{i8:14} God’s People Unrepentant
{8:14} Why are we just sitting here? Gather together; let us enter the fortified cities and perish there, for the Lord our God has destroyed us. He has given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against the Lord.
{8:15} We hoped for peace, but there was nothing good; for a time of healing, but there was only terror.
{8:16} From Dan the snorting of horses is heard. At the sound of the neighing of mighty steeds, the whole land quakes. They come to devour the land and everything in it, the city and all its residents.
{8:17} Indeed, I am about to send snakes among you, poisonous vipers that cannot be charmed. They will bite you. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{i8:18} Lament over Judah
{8:18} My joy has flown away; grief has settled on me. My heart is sick.
{8:19} Listen — the cry of my dear people from a far away land, “Is the Lord no longer in Zion, her King not within her?” Why have they provoked me to anger with their carved images, with their worthless foreign idols?
{8:20} Harvest has passed, summer has ended, but we have not been saved.
{8:21} I am broken by the brokenness of my dear people. I mourn; horror has taken hold of me.
{8:22} Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? So why has the healing of my dear people not come about?
{9:1} If my head were a spring of water, my eyes a fountain of tears, I would weep day and night over the slain of my dear people.
{9:2} If only I had a traveler’s lodging place in the wilderness, I would abandon my people and depart from them, for they are all adulterers, a solemn assembly of treacherous people.
{9:3} They bent their tongues like their bows; lies and not faithfulness prevail in the land, for they proceed from one evil to another, and they do not take Me into account. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{i9:4} Imminent Ruin and Exile
{9:4} Everyone has to be on guard against his friend. Don’t trust any brother, for every brother will certainly deceive, and every friend spread slander.
{9:5} Each one betrays his friend; no one tells the truth. They have taught their tongues to speak lies; they wear themselves out doing wrong.
{9:6} You live in a world of deception. In their deception they refuse to know Me. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{9:7} Therefore, this is what the Lord of Hosts says: I am about to refine them and test them, for what else can I do because of My dear people?
{9:8} Their tongues are deadly arrows — they speak deception. With his mouth a man speaks peaceably with his friend, but inwardly he sets up an ambush.
{9:9} Should I not punish them for these things? This is the Lord’s declaration. Should I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?
{9:10} I will raise weeping and a lament over the mountains, a dirge over the wilderness grazing land, for they have been so scorched that no one passes through. The sound of cattle is no longer heard. From the birds of the sky to the animals, everything has fled — they have gone away.
{9:11} I will make Jerusalem a heap of rubble, a jackals’ den. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, an uninhabited place.
{9:12} Who is the man wise enough to understand this? Who has the Lord spoken to, that he may explain it? Why is the land destroyed and scorched like a wilderness, so no one can pass through?
{9:13} The Lord said, “It is because they abandoned My instruction that I set in front of them and did not obey My voice or walk according to it.
{9:14} Instead, they followed the stubbornness of their hearts and followed after the Baals as their fathers taught them.”
{9:15} Therefore, this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “I am about to feed this people wormwood and give them poisonous water to drink.
{9:16} I will scatter them among the nations that they and their fathers have not known. I will send a sword after them until I have finished them off.”
{i9:17} Mourning over Judah
{9:17} This is what the Lord of Hosts says: Consider, and summon the women who mourn; send for the skillful women.
{9:18} Let them come quickly to raise a lament over us so that our eyes may overflow with tears, our eyelids soaked with weeping.
{9:19} For a sound of lamentation is heard from Zion: How devastated we are. We are greatly ashamed, for we have abandoned the land; our dwellings have been torn down.
{9:20} Now hear the word of the Lord, you women. Pay attention to the word of His mouth. Teach your daughters a lament and one another a dirge,
{9:21} for Death has climbed through our windows; it has entered our fortresses, cutting off children from the streets, young men from the squares.
{9:22} Speak as follows: This is what the Lord says: Human corpses will fall like manure on the surface of the field, like newly cut grain after the reaper with no one to gather it.
{i9:23} Boast in the Lord
{9:23} This is what the Lord says: The wise man must not boast in his wisdom; the strong man must not boast in his strength; the wealthy man must not boast in his wealth.
{9:24} But the one who boasts should boast in this, that he understands and knows Me — that I am Yahweh, showing faithful love, justice, and righteousness on the earth, for I delight in these things. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{9:25} “The days are coming” — the Lord’s declaration — “when I will punish all the circumcised yet uncircumcised:
{9:26} Egypt, Judah, Edom, the Ammonites, Moab, and all the inhabitants of the desert who clip the hair on their temples. All these nations are uncircumcised, and the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.”
{i10:1} False Gods Contrasted with the Creator
{10:1} Hear the word that the Lord has spoken to you, house of Israel.
{10:2} This is what the Lord says: Do not learn the way of the nations or be terrified by signs in the heavens, although the nations are terrified by them,
{10:3} for the customs of the peoples are worthless. Someone cuts down a tree from the forest; it is worked by the hands of a craftsman with a chisel.
{10:4} He decorates it with silver and gold. It is fastened with hammer and nails, so it won’t totter.
{10:5} Like scarecrows in a cucumber patch, their idols cannot speak. They must be carried because they cannot walk. Do not fear them for they can do no harm — and they cannot do any good.
{10:6} Yahweh, there is no one like You. You are great; Your name is great in power.
{10:7} Who should not fear You, King of the nations? It is what You deserve. For among all the wise people of the nations and among all their kingdoms, there is no one like You.
{10:8} They are both stupid and foolish, instructed by worthless idols made of wood!
{10:9} Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz from the hands of a goldsmith, the work of a craftsman. Their clothing is blue and purple, all the work of skilled artisans.
{10:10} But Yahweh is the true God; He is the living God and eternal King. The earth quakes at His wrath, and the nations cannot endure His rage.
{10:11} You are to say this to them, “The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under these heavens.”
{10:12} He made the earth by His power, established the world by His wisdom, and spread out the heavens by His understanding.
{10:13} When He thunders, the waters in the heavens are in turmoil, and He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings the wind from His storehouses.
{10:14} Everyone is stupid and ignorant. Every goldsmith is put to shame by his carved image, for his cast images are a lie; there is no breath in them.
{10:15} They are worthless, a work to be mocked. At the time of their punishment they will be destroyed.
{10:16} Jacob’s Portion is not like these because He is the One who formed all things. Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; Yahweh of Hosts is His name.
{i10:17} Exile After the Siege
{10:17} Gather up your belongings from the ground, you who live under siege.
{10:18} For this is what the Lord says: Look, I am slinging out the land’s residents at this time and bringing them such distress that they will feel it.
{i10:19} Jeremiah Grieves
{10:19} Woe to me because of my brokenness — I am severely wounded! I exclaimed, “This is my intense suffering, but I must bear it.”
{10:20} My tent is destroyed; all my tent cords are snapped. My sons have departed from me and are no more. I have no one to pitch my tent again or to hang up my curtains.
{10:21} For the shepherds are stupid: they don’t seek the Lord. Therefore they have not prospered, and their whole flock is scattered.
{10:22} Listen! A noise — it is coming — a great commotion from the land to the north. The cities of Judah will be made desolate, a jackals’ den.
{10:23} I know, Lord, that a man’s way of life is not his own; no one who walks determines his own steps.
{10:24} Discipline me, Lord, but with justice — not in Your anger, or You will reduce me to nothing.
{10:25} Pour out Your wrath on the nations that don’t recognize You and on the families that don’t call on Your name, for they have consumed Jacob; they have consumed him and finished him off and made his homeland desolate.
{i11:1} Reminder of the Covenant
{11:1} This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
{11:2} “Listen to the words of this covenant and tell them to the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.
{11:3} You must tell them: This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Let a curse be on the man who does not obey the words of this covenant,
{11:4} which I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace.’ I declared: ‘Obey Me, and do everything that I command you, and you will be My people, and I will be your God,’
{11:5} in order to establish the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is today.” I answered, “Amen, Lord.”
{11:6} The Lord said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: Obey the words of this covenant and carry them out.
{11:7} For I strongly warned your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt until today, warning them time and time again, ‘Obey My voice.’
{11:8} Yet they would not obey or pay attention; each one followed the stubbornness of his evil heart. So I brought on them all the curses of this covenant, because they had not done what I commanded them to do.”
{11:9} The Lord said to me, “A conspiracy has been discovered among the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.
{11:10} They have returned to the sins of their ancestors who refused to obey My words and have followed other gods to worship them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah broke My covenant I made with their ancestors.
{11:11} “Therefore, this is what the Lord says: I am about to bring on them disaster that they cannot escape. They will cry out to Me, but I will not hear them.
{11:12} Then the cities of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods they have been burning incense to, but they certainly will not save them in their time of disaster.
{11:13} Your gods are indeed as numerous as your cities, Judah, and the altars you have set up to Shame — altars to burn incense to Baal — as numerous as the streets of Jerusalem.
{11:14} “As for you, do not pray for these people. Do not raise up a cry or a prayer on their behalf, for I will not be listening when they call out to Me at the time of their disaster.
{11:15} What right does My beloved have to be in My house, having carried out so many evil schemes? Can holy meat prevent your disaster so you can rejoice?
{11:16} The Lord named you a flourishing olive tree, beautiful with well-formed fruit. He has set fire to it, and its branches are consumed with a great roaring sound.
{11:17} “The Lord of Hosts who planted you has decreed disaster against you, because of the harm the house of Israel and the house of Judah brought on themselves, provoking Me to anger by burning incense to Baal.”
{11:18} The Lord informed me, so I knew. Then You helped me to see their deeds,
{11:19} for I was like a docile lamb led to slaughter. I didn’t know that they had devised plots against me: “Let’s destroy the tree with its fruit; let’s cut him off from the land of the living so that his name will no longer be remembered.”
{11:20} But, Lord of Hosts, who judges righteously, who tests heart and mind, let me see Your vengeance on them, for I have presented my case to You.
{11:21} Therefore, here is what the Lord says concerning the people of Anathoth who want to take your life. They warn, “You must not prophesy in the name of Yahweh, or you will certainly die at our hand.”
{11:22} Therefore, this is what the Lord of Hosts says: “I am about to punish them. The young men will die by the sword; their sons and daughters will die by famine.
{11:23} They will have no remnant, for I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.”
{i12:1} Jeremiah’s Complaint
{12:1} You will be righteous, Lord, even if I bring a case against You. Yet, I wish to contend with You: Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why do all the treacherous live at ease?
{12:2} You planted them, and they have taken root. They have grown and produced fruit. You are ever on their lips, but far from their conscience.
{12:3} As for You, Lord, You know me; You see me. You test whether my heart is with You. Drag the wicked away like sheep to slaughter and set them apart for the day of killing.
{12:4} How long will the land mourn and the grass of every field wither? Because of the evil of its residents, animals and birds have been swept away, for the people have said, “He cannot see what our end will be.”
{i12:5} The Lord ’s Response
{12:5} If you have raced with runners and they have worn you out, how can you compete with horses? If you stumble in a peaceful land, what will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?
{12:6} Even your brothers — your own father’s household — even they were treacherous to you; even they have cried out loudly after you. Do not have confidence in them, though they speak well of you.
{12:7} I have abandoned My house; I have deserted My inheritance. I have given the love of My life into the hands of her enemies.
{12:8} My inheritance has acted toward Me like a lion in the forest. She has roared against Me. Therefore, I hate her.
{12:9} Is My inheritance like a hyena to Me? Are birds of prey circling her? Go, gather all the wild animals; bring them to devour her.
{12:10} Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard; they have trampled My plot of land. They have turned My desirable plot into a desolate wasteland.
{12:11} They have made it a desolation. It mourns, desolate, before Me. All the land is desolate, but no one takes it to heart.
{12:12} Over all the barren heights in the wilderness the destroyers have come, for the Lord has a sword that devours from one end of the earth to the other. No one has peace.
{12:13} They have sown wheat but harvested thorns. They have exhausted themselves but have no profit. Be put to shame by your harvests because of the Lord’s burning anger.
{12:14} This is what the Lord says: “Concerning all My evil neighbors who attack the inheritance that I bequeathed to My people, Israel, I am about to uproot them from their land, and I will uproot the house of Judah from them.
{12:15} After I have uprooted them, I will once again have compassion on them and return each one to his inheritance and to his land.
{12:16} If they will diligently learn the ways of My people — to swear by My name, ‘As Yahweh lives,’ just as they taught My people to swear by Baal — they will be built up among My people.
{12:17} However, if they will not obey, then I will uproot and destroy that nation.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{i13:1} Linen Underwear
{13:1} This is what the Lord said to me: “Go and buy yourself a linen undergarment and put it on, but do not put it in water.”
{13:2} So I bought underwear as the Lord instructed me and put it on.
{13:3} Then the word of the Lord came to me a second time:
{13:4} “Take the underwear that you bought and are wearing, and go at once to the Euphrates and hide it in a rocky crevice.”
{13:5} So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me.
{13:6} A long time later the Lord said to me, “Go at once to the Euphrates and get the underwear that I commanded you to hide there.”
{13:7} So I went to the Euphrates and dug up the underwear and got it from the place where I had hidden it, but it was ruined — of no use at all.
{13:8} Then the word of the Lord came to me:
{13:9} “This is what the Lord says: Just like this I will ruin the great pride of both Judah and Jerusalem.
{13:10} These evil people, who refuse to listen to Me, who follow the stubbornness of their own hearts, and who have followed other gods to serve and worship — they will be like this underwear, of no use at all.
{13:11} Just as underwear clings to one’s waist, so I fastened the whole house of Israel and of Judah to Me” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “so that they might be My people for My fame, praise, and glory, but they would not obey.
{i13:12} The Wine Jars
{13:12} “Say this to them: This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Every jar should be filled with wine. Then they will respond to you, ‘Don’t we know that every jar should be filled with wine?’
{13:13} And you will say to them: This is what the Lord says: I am about to fill all who live in this land — the kings who reign for David on his throne, the priests, the prophets and all the residents of Jerusalem — with drunkenness.
{13:14} I will smash them against each other, fathers and sons alike” — this is the Lord’s declaration. “I will allow no mercy, pity, or compassion to keep Me from destroying them.”
{i13:15} The Lord ’s Warning
{13:15} Listen and pay attention. Do not be proud, for the Lord has spoken.
{13:16} Give glory to the Lord your God before He brings darkness, before your feet stumble on the mountains at dusk. You wait for light, but He brings darkest gloom and makes thick darkness.
{13:17} But if you will not listen, my innermost being will weep in secret because of your pride. My eyes will overflow with tears, for the Lord’s flock has been taken captive.
{13:18} Say to the king and the queen mother: Take a humble seat, for your glorious crowns have fallen from your heads.
{13:19} The cities of the Negev are under siege; no one can help them. All of Judah has been taken into exile, taken completely into exile.
{13:20} Look up and see those coming from the north. Where is the flock entrusted to you, the sheep that were your pride?
{i13:21} The Destiny of Jerusalem
{13:21} What will you say when He appoints close friends as leaders over you, ones you yourself trained? Won’t labor pains seize you, as they do a woman in labor?
{13:22} And when you ask yourself, “Why have these things happened to me?” It is because of your great guilt that your skirts have been stripped off, your body exposed.
{13:23} Can the Cushite change his skin, or a leopard his spots? If so, you might be able to do what is good, you who are instructed in evil.
{13:24} I will scatter you like drifting chaff before the desert wind.
{13:25} This is your lot, what I have decreed for you — this is the Lord’s declaration — because you have forgotten Me and trusted in Falsehood.
{13:26} I will pull your skirts up over your face so that your shame might be seen.
{13:27} Your adulteries and your lustful neighing, your heinous prostitution on the hills, in the fields — I have seen your detestable acts. Woe to you, Jerusalem! You are unclean — for how long yet?
{i14:1} The Drought
{14:1} The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:
{14:2} Judah mourns; her gates languish. Her people are on the ground in mourning; Jerusalem’s cry rises up.
{14:3} Their nobles send their servants for water. They go to the cisterns; they find no water; their containers return empty. They are ashamed and humiliated; they cover their heads.
{14:4} The ground is cracked since no rain has fallen on the land. The farmers are ashamed; they cover their heads.
{14:5} Even the doe in the field gives birth and abandons her fawn since there is no grass.
{14:6} Wild donkeys stand on the barren heights panting for air like jackals. Their eyes fail because there are no green plants.
{14:7} Though our guilt testifies against us, Yahweh, act for Your name’s sake. Indeed, our rebellions are many; we have sinned against You.
{14:8} Hope of Israel, its Savior in time of distress, why are You like a foreigner in the land, like a traveler stopping only for the night?
{14:9} Why are You like a helpless man, like a warrior unable to save? Yet You are among us, Yahweh, and we are called by Your name. Don’t leave us!
{14:10} This is what the Lord says concerning these people: Truly they love to wander; they never rest their feet. So the Lord does not accept them. Now He will remember their guilt and punish their sins.
{i14:11} False Prophets to be Punished
{14:11} Then the Lord said to me, “Do not pray for the well-being of these people.
{14:12} If they fast, I will not hear their cry of despair. If they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. Rather, I will finish them off by sword, famine, and plague.”
{14:13} And I replied, “Oh no, Lord God! The prophets are telling them, ‘You won’t see sword or suffer famine. I will certainly give you true peace in this place.’”
{14:14} But the Lord said to me, “These prophets are prophesying a lie in My name. I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a false vision, worthless divination, the deceit of their own minds.
{14:15} “Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning the prophets who prophesy in My name, though I did not send them, and who say, ‘There will never be sword or famine in this land.’ By sword and famine these prophets will meet their end.
{14:16} The people they are prophesying to will be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword. There will be no one to bury them — they, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. I will pour out their own evil on them.”
{i14:17} Jeremiah’s Request
{14:17} You are to speak this word to them: Let my eyes overflow with tears; day and night may they not stop, for the virgin daughter of my people has been destroyed by a great disaster, an extremely severe wound.
{14:18} If I go out to the field, look — those slain by the sword! If I enter the city, look — those ill from famine! For both prophet and priest travel to a land they do not know.
{14:19} Have You completely rejected Judah? Do You detest Zion? Why do You strike us with no hope of healing for us? We hoped for peace, but there was nothing good; for a time of healing, but there was only terror.
{14:20} We acknowledge our wickedness, Lord, the guilt of our fathers; indeed, we have sinned against You.
{14:21} Because of Your name, don’t despise us. Don’t disdain Your glorious throne. Remember Your covenant with us; do not break it.
{14:22} Can any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain? Or can the skies alone give showers? Are You not the Lord our God? We therefore put our hope in You, for You have done all these things.
{i15:1} The Lord ’s Negative Response
{15:1} Then the Lord said to me: “Even if Moses and Samuel should stand before Me, My compassions would not reach out to these people. Send them from My presence, and let them go.
{15:2} If they ask you, ‘Where will we go?’ you must tell them: This is what the Lord says: Those destined for death, to death; those destined for the sword, to the sword. Those destined for famine, to famine; those destined for captivity, to captivity.
{15:3} “I will ordain four kinds of judgment for them” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, and the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the land to devour and destroy.
{15:4} I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.
{15:5} Who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? Who will show sympathy toward you? Who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?
{15:6} You have left Me. This is the Lord’s declaration. You have turned your back, so I have stretched out My hand against you and destroyed you. I am tired of showing compassion.
{15:7} I scattered them with a winnowing fork at the gates of the land. I made them childless; I destroyed My people. They would not turn from their ways.
{15:8} I made their widows more numerous than the sand of the seas. I brought a destroyer at noon against the mother of young men. I suddenly released on her agitation and terrors.
{15:9} The mother of seven grew faint; she breathed her last breath. Her sun set while it was still day; she was ashamed and humiliated. The rest of them I will give over to the sword in the presence of their enemies.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{i15:10} Jeremiah’s Complaint
{15:10} Woe is me, my mother, that you gave birth to me, a man who incites dispute and conflict in all the land. I did not lend or borrow, yet everyone curses me.
{i15:11} The Lord ’s Response
{15:11} The Lord said: I will certainly set you free and care for you. I will certainly intercede for you in a time of trouble, in your time of distress, with the enemy.
{15:12} Can anyone smash iron, iron from the north, or bronze?
{15:13} I will give up your wealth and your treasures as plunder, without cost, for all your sins in all your borders.
{15:14} Then I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know, for My anger will kindle a fire that will burn against you.
{i15:15} Jeremiah’s Prayer for Vengeance
{15:15} You know, Lord; remember me and take note of me. Avenge me against my persecutors. In Your patience, don’t take me away. Know that I suffer disgrace for Your honor.
{15:16} Your words were found, and I ate them. Your words became a delight to me and the joy of my heart, for I am called by Your name, Yahweh God of Hosts.
{15:17} I never sat with the band of revelers, and I did not celebrate with them. Because Your hand was on me, I sat alone, for You filled me with indignation.
{15:18} Why has my pain become unending, my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? You truly have become like a mirage to me — water that is not reliable.
{i15:19} Jeremiah Told to Repent
{15:19} Therefore, this is what the Lord says: If you return, I will restore you; you will stand in My presence. And if you speak noble words, rather than worthless ones, you will be My spokesman. It is they who must return to you; you must not return to them.
{15:20} Then I will make you a fortified wall of bronze to this people. They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to save you and deliver you. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{15:21} I will deliver you from the power of evil people and redeem you from the control of the ruthless.
{i16:1} No Marriage for Jeremiah
{16:1} The word of the Lord came to me:
{16:2} “You must not marry or have sons or daughters in this place.
{16:3} For this is what the Lord says concerning sons and daughters born in this place as well as concerning the mothers who bear them and the fathers who father them in this land:
{16:4} They will die from deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like manure on the face of the earth. They will be finished off by sword and famine. Their corpses will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the land.
{16:5} “For this is what the Lord says: Don’t enter a house where a mourning feast is taking place. Don’t go to lament or sympathize with them, for I have removed My peace from these people” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “as well as My faithful love and compassion.
{16:6} Both great and small will die in this land without burial. No lament will be made for them, nor will anyone cut himself or shave his head for them.
{16:7} Food won’t be provided for the mourner to comfort him because of the dead. A cup of consolation won’t be given him because of the loss of his father or mother.
{16:8} You must not enter the house where feasting is taking place to sit with them to eat and drink.
{16:9} For this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am about to eliminate from this place, before your very eyes and in your time, the sound of joy and gladness, the voice of the groom and the bride.
{i16:10} Abandoning the Lord and His Law
{16:10} “When you tell these people all these things, they will say to you, ‘Why has the Lord declared all this great disaster against us? What is our guilt? What is our sin that we have committed against the Lord our God?’
{16:11} Then you will answer them: Because your fathers abandoned Me” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “and followed other gods, served them, and worshiped them. Indeed, they abandoned Me and did not keep My instruction.
{16:12} You did more evil than your fathers. Look, each one of you was following the stubbornness of his evil heart, not obeying Me.
{16:13} So I will hurl you from this land into a land that you and your fathers are not familiar with. There you will worship other gods both day and night, for I will not grant you grace.
{16:14} “However, take note! The days are coming” — the Lord’s declaration — “when it will no longer be said, ‘As the Lord lives who brought the Israelites from the land of Egypt,’
{16:15} but rather, ‘As the Lord lives who brought the Israelites from the land of the north and from all the other lands where He had banished them.’ For I will return them to their land that I gave to their ancestors.
{i16:16} Punishment of Exile
{16:16} “I am about to send for many fishermen” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “and they will fish for them. Then I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and out of the clefts of the rocks,
{16:17} for My gaze takes in all their ways. They are not concealed from Me, and their guilt is not hidden from My sight.
{16:18} I will first repay them double for their guilt and sin because they have polluted My land. They have filled My inheritance with the lifelessness of their detestable and abhorrent idols.”
{16:19} Lord, my strength and my stronghold, my refuge in a time of distress, the nations will come to You from the ends of the earth, and they will say, “Our fathers inherited only lies, worthless idols of no benefit at all.”
{16:20} Can one make gods for himself? But they are not gods.
{16:21} “Therefore, I am about to inform them, and this time I will make them know My power and My might; then they will know that My name is Yahweh.”
{i17:1} The Persistent Sin of Judah
{17:1} The sin of Judah is written with an iron stylus. With a diamond point it is engraved on the tablet of their hearts and on the horns of their altars,
{17:2} while their children remember their altars and their Asherah poles, by the green trees on the high hills —
{17:3} My mountains in the countryside. I will give up your wealth and all your treasures as plunder because of the sin of your high places in all your borders.
{17:4} You will, on your own, relinquish your inheritance that I gave you. I will make you serve your enemies in a land you do not know, for you have set My anger on fire; it will burn forever.
{i17:5} Curse and Blessing
{17:5} This is what the Lord says: The man who trusts in mankind, who makes human flesh his strength and turns his heart from the Lord is cursed.
{17:6} He will be like a juniper in the Arabah; he cannot see when good comes but dwells in the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land where no one lives.
{17:7} The man who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence indeed is the Lord, is blessed.
{17:8} He will be like a tree planted by water: it sends its roots out toward a stream, it doesn’t fear when heat comes, and its foliage remains green. It will not worry in a year of drought or cease producing fruit.
{i17:9} The Deceitful Heart
{17:9} The heart is more deceitful than anything else, and incurable — who can understand it?
{17:10} I, Yahweh, examine the mind, I test the heart to give to each according to his way, according to what his actions deserve.
{17:11} He who makes a fortune unjustly is like a partridge that hatches eggs it didn’t lay. In the middle of his days his riches will abandon him, so in the end he will be a fool.
{17:12} A throne of glory on high from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.
{17:13} Lord, the hope of Israel, all who abandon You will be put to shame. All who turn away from Me will be written in the dirt, for they have abandoned the Lord, the fountain of living water.
{i17:14} Jeremiah’s Plea
{17:14} Heal me, Lord, and I will be healed; save me, and I will be saved, for You are my praise.
{17:15} Hear how they keep challenging me, “Where is the word of the Lord? Let it come!”
{17:16} But I have not run away from being Your shepherd, and I have not longed for the fatal day. You know my words were spoken in Your presence.
{17:17} Don’t become a terror to me. You are my refuge in the day of disaster.
{17:18} Let my persecutors be put to shame, but don’t let me be put to shame. Let them be terrified, but don’t let me be terrified. Bring on them the day of disaster; shatter them with total destruction.
{i17:19} Observing the Sabbath
{17:19} This is what the Lord said to me, “Go and stand at the People’s Gate, through which the kings of Judah enter and leave, as well as at all the gates of Jerusalem.
{17:20} Announce to them: Hear the word of the Lord, kings of Judah, all Judah, and all the residents of Jerusalem who enter through these gates.
{17:21} This is what the Lord says: Watch yourselves; do not pick up a load and bring it in through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day.
{17:22} You must not carry a load out of your houses on the Sabbath day or do any work, but you must consecrate the Sabbath day, just as I commanded your ancestors.
{17:23} They wouldn’t listen or pay attention but became obstinate, not listening or accepting discipline.
{17:24} “However, if you listen to Me, says the Lord, and do not bring loads through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day and consecrate the Sabbath day and do no work on it,
{17:25} kings and princes will enter through the gates of this city. They will sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses with their officials, the men of Judah, and the residents of Jerusalem. This city will be inhabited forever.
{17:26} Then people will come from the cities of Judah and from the area around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin and from the Judean foothills, from the hill country and from the Negev bringing burnt offerings and sacrifice, grain offerings and frankincense, and thank offerings to the house of the Lord.
{17:27} If you do not listen to Me to consecrate the Sabbath day by not carrying a load while entering the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, I will set fire to its gates, and it will consume the citadels of Jerusalem and not be extinguished.”
{i18:1} Parable of the Potter
{18:1} This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
{18:2} “Go down at once to the potter’s house; there I will reveal My words to you.”
{18:3} So I went down to the potter’s house, and there he was, working away at the wheel.
{18:4} But the jar that he was making from the clay became flawed in the potter’s hand, so he made it into another jar, as it seemed right for him to do.
{18:5} The word of the Lord came to me:
{18:6} “House of Israel, can I not treat you as this potter treats his clay?” — this is the Lord’s declaration. “Just like clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, house of Israel.
{18:7} At one moment I might announce concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will uproot, tear down, and destroy it.
{18:8} However, if that nation I have made an announcement about turns from its evil, I will relent concerning the disaster I had planned to do to it.
{18:9} At another time I announce that I will build and plant a nation or a kingdom.
{18:10} However, if it does what is evil in My sight by not listening to My voice, I will relent concerning the good I had said I would do to it.
{18:11} So now, say to the men of Judah and to the residents of Jerusalem: This is what the Lord says: I am about to bring harm to you and make plans against you. Turn now, each from your evil way, and correct your ways and your deeds.
{18:12} But they will say, ‘It’s hopeless. We will continue to follow our plans, and each of us will continue to act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’”
{i18:13} Deluded Israel
{18:13} Therefore, this is what the Lord says: Ask among the nations, Who has heard things like these? Virgin Israel has done a most terrible thing.
{18:14} Does the snow of Lebanon ever leave the highland crags? Or does cold water flowing from a distance ever fail?
{18:15} Yet My people have forgotten Me. They burn incense to false idols that make them stumble in their ways on the ancient roads and walk on new paths, not the highway.
{18:16} They have made their land a horror, a perpetual object of scorn; everyone who passes by it will be horrified and shake his head.
{18:17} I will scatter them before the enemy like the east wind. I will show them My back and not My face on the day of their calamity.
{i18:18} Plot against Jeremiah
{18:18} Then certain ones said, “Come, let’s make plans against Jeremiah, for instruction will never be lost from the priest, or counsel from the wise, or an oracle from the prophet. Come, let’s denounce him and pay no attention to all his words.”
{18:19} Pay attention to me, Lord. Hear what my opponents are saying!
{18:20} Should good be repaid with evil? Yet they have dug a pit for me. Remember how I stood before You to speak good on their behalf, to turn Your anger from them.
{18:21} Therefore, hand their children over to famine, and pour the sword’s power on them. Let their wives become childless and widowed, their husbands slain by deadly disease, their young men struck down by the sword in battle.
{18:22} Let a cry be heard from their houses when You suddenly bring raiders against them, for they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet.
{18:23} But You, Lord, know all their deadly plots against me. Do not wipe out their guilt; do not blot out their sin before You. Let them be forced to stumble before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger.
{i19:1} The Clay Jar
{19:1} This is what the Lord says: “Go, buy a potter’s clay jar. Take some of the elders of the people and some of the leading priests
{19:2} and go out to the Valley of Hinnom near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. Proclaim there the words I speak to you.
{19:3} Say: Hear the word of the Lord, kings of Judah and residents of Jerusalem. This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am going to bring such disaster on this place that everyone who hears about it will shudder
{19:4} because they have abandoned Me and made this a foreign place. They have burned incense in it to other gods that they, their fathers, and the kings of Judah have never known. They have filled this place with the blood of the innocent.
{19:5} They have built high places to Baal on which to burn their children in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, something I have never commanded or mentioned; I never entertained the thought.
{19:6} “Therefore, take note! The days are coming” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “when this place will no longer be called Topheth and the Valley of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.
{19:7} I will spoil the plans of Judah and Jerusalem in this place. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, by the hand of those who want to take their life. I will provide their corpses as food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the land.
{19:8} I will make this city desolate, an object of scorn. Everyone who passes by it will be horrified and scoff because of all its wounds.
{19:9} I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and they will eat each other’s flesh in the siege and distress that their enemies, those who want to take their life, inflict on them.
{19:10} “Then you are to shatter the jar in the presence of the people traveling with you,
{19:11} and you are to proclaim to them: This is what the Lord of Hosts says: I will shatter these people and this city, like one shatters a potter’s jar that can never again be mended. They will bury the dead in Topheth because there is no other place for burials.
{19:12} I will do so to this place” — this is the declaration of the Lord — “and to its residents, making this city like Topheth.
{19:13} The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will become impure like that place Topheth — all the houses on whose rooftops they have burned incense to the whole heavenly host and poured out drink offerings to other gods.”
{19:14} Jeremiah came back from Topheth, where the Lord had sent him to prophesy, stood in the courtyard of the Lord’s temple, and proclaimed to all the people,
{19:15} “This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘I am about to bring on this city — and on all its dependent villages — all the disaster that I spoke against it, for they have become obstinate, not obeying My words.’”
{i20:1} Jeremiah Beaten by Pashhur
{20:1} Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer and chief official in the temple of the Lord, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
{20:2} So Pashhur had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put him in the stocks at the Upper Benjamin Gate in the Lord’s temple.
{20:3} The next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The Lord does not call you Pashhur, but Magor-missabib,
{20:4} for this is what the Lord says, ‘I am about to make you a terror to both yourself and those you love. They will fall by the sword of their enemies before your very eyes. I will hand Judah over to the king of Babylon, and he will deport them to Babylon and put them to the sword.
{20:5} I will give away all the wealth of this city, all its products and valuables. Indeed, I will hand all the treasures of the kings of Judah over to their enemies. They will plunder them, seize them, and carry them off to Babylon.
{20:6} As for you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house, you will go into captivity. You will go to Babylon. There you will die, and there you will be buried, you and all your friends that you prophesied falsely to.’”
{i20:7} Jeremiah Compelled to Preach
{20:7} You deceived me, Lord, and I was deceived. You seized me and prevailed. I am a laughingstock all the time; everyone ridicules me.
{20:8} For whenever I speak, I cry out, I proclaim, “Violence and destruction!” because the word of the Lord has become for me constant disgrace and derision.
{20:9} If I say, “I won’t mention Him or speak any longer in His name,” His message becomes a fire burning in my heart, shut up in my bones. I become tired of holding it in, and I cannot prevail.
{20:10} For I have heard the gossip of many people, “Terror is on every side! Report him; let’s report him!” Everyone I trusted watches for my fall. “Perhaps he will be deceived so that we might prevail against him and take our vengeance on him.”
{20:11} But the Lord is with me like a violent warrior. Therefore, my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. Since they have not succeeded, they will be utterly shamed, an everlasting humiliation that will never be forgotten.
{20:12} Lord of Hosts, testing the righteous and seeing the heart and mind, let me see Your vengeance on them, for I have presented my case to You.
{20:13} Sing to the Lord! Praise the Lord, for He rescues the life of the needy from the hand of evil people.
{i20:14} Jeremiah’s Lament
{20:14} May the day I was born be cursed. May the day my mother bore me never be blessed.
{20:15} May the man be cursed who brought the news to my father, saying, “A male child is born to you,” bringing him great joy.
{20:16} Let that man be like the cities the Lord demolished without compassion. Let him hear an outcry in the morning and a war cry at noontime
{20:17} because he didn’t kill me in the womb so that my mother might have been my grave, her womb eternally pregnant.
{20:18} Why did I come out of the womb to see only struggle and sorrow, to end my life in shame?
{i21:1} Zedekiah’s Request Denied
{21:1} This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur son of Malchijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah, asking,
{21:2} “Ask the Lord on our behalf, since Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is making war against us. Perhaps the Lord will perform for us something like all His past wonderful works so that Nebuchadnezzar will withdraw from us.”
{21:3} But Jeremiah answered, “This is what you are to say to Zedekiah:
{21:4} ‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I will repel the weapons of war in your hands, those you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the wall, and I will bring them into the center of this city.
{21:5} I will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm, with anger, rage, and great wrath.
{21:6} I will strike the residents of this city, both man and beast. They will die in a great plague.
{21:7} Afterward’” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “‘King Zedekiah of Judah, his officers, and the people — those in this city who survive the plague, the sword, and the famine — I will hand over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, to their enemies, yes, to those who want to take their lives. He will put them to the sword; he won’t spare them or show pity or compassion.’
{i21:8} A Warning for the People
{21:8} “But you must say to this people, ‘This is what the Lord says: Look, I am presenting to you the way of life and the way of death.
{21:9} Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine, and plague, but whoever goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live and will retain his life like the spoils of war.
{21:10} For I have turned against this city to bring disaster and not good’” — this is the Lord’s declaration. “‘It will be handed over to the king of Babylon, who will burn it down.’
{21:11} “And to the house of the king of Judah say this: ‘Hear the word of the Lord!
{21:12} House of David, this is what the Lord says: Administer justice every morning, and rescue the victim of robbery from the hand of his oppressor, or My anger will flare up like fire and burn unquenchably because of their evil deeds.
{21:13} Beware! I am against you, you who sit above the valley, you atop the rocky plateau — this is the Lord’s declaration — you who say, “Who can come down against us? Who can enter our hiding places?”
{21:14} I will punish you according to what you have done — this is the Lord’s declaration. I will kindle a fire in its forest that will consume everything around it.’”
{i22:1} Judgment against Sinful Kings
{22:1} This is what the Lord says: “Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and announce this word there.
{22:2} You are to say: Hear the word of the Lord, king of Judah, you who sit on the throne of David — you, your officers, and your people who enter these gates.
{22:3} This is what the Lord says: Administer justice and righteousness. Rescue the victim of robbery from the hand of his oppressor. Don’t exploit or brutalize the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow. Don’t shed innocent blood in this place.
{22:4} For if you conscientiously carry out this word, then kings sitting on David’s throne will enter through the gates of this palace riding on chariots and horses — they, their officers, and their people.
{22:5} But if you do not obey these words, then I swear by Myself” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “that this house will become a ruin.”
{22:6} For this is what the Lord says concerning the house of the king of Judah: You are like Gilead to Me, or the summit of Lebanon, but I will certainly turn you into a wilderness, uninhabited cities.
{22:7} I will appoint destroyers against you, each with his weapons. They will cut down the choicest of your cedars and throw them into the fire.
{22:8} “Many nations will pass by this city and ask one another, ‘Why did the Lord do such a thing to this great city?’
{22:9} They will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their God and worshiped and served other gods.’”
{i22:10} A Message Concerning Shallum
{22:10} Do not weep for the dead; do not mourn for him. Weep bitterly for the one who has gone away, for he will never return again and see his native land.
{22:11} For this is what the Lord says concerning Shallum son of Josiah, king of Judah, who became king in place of his father Josiah: “He has left this place — he will never return here again,
{22:12} but he will die in the place where they deported him, never seeing this land again.”
{i22:13} A Message concerning Jehoiakim
{22:13} Woe for the one who builds his palace through unrighteousness, his upper rooms through injustice, who makes his fellow man serve without pay and will not give him his wages,
{22:14} who says, “I will build myself a massive palace, with spacious upper rooms.” He will cut windows in it, and it will be paneled with cedar and painted with vermilion.
{22:15} Are you a king because you excel in cedar? Didn’t your father eat and drink and administer justice and righteousness? Then it went well with him.
{22:16} He took up the case of the poor and needy, then it went well. Is this not what it means to know Me? This is the Lord’s declaration.
{22:17} But you have eyes and a heart for nothing except your own dishonest profit, shedding innocent blood and committing extortion and oppression.
{22:18} Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah: They will not mourn for him, saying, “Woe, my brother!” or “Woe, my sister!” They will not mourn for him, saying, “Woe, lord! Woe, his majesty!”
{22:19} He will be buried like a donkey, dragged off and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.
{22:20} Go up to Lebanon and cry out; raise your voice in Bashan; cry out from Abarim, for all your lovers have been crushed.
{22:21} I spoke to you when you were secure. You said, “I will not listen.” This has been your way since youth; indeed, you have never listened to Me.
{22:22} The wind will take charge of all your shepherds, and your lovers will go into captivity. Then you will be ashamed and humiliated because of all your evil.
{22:23} You residents of Lebanon, nestled among the cedars, how you will groan when labor pains come on you, agony like a woman in labor.
{i22:24} A Message concerning Coniah
{22:24} “As I live,” says the Lord, “though you, Coniah son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, were a signet ring on My right hand, I would tear you from it.
{22:25} In fact, I will hand you over to those you dread, who want to take your life, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Chaldeans.
{22:26} I will hurl you and the mother who gave birth to you into another land, where neither of you were born, and there you will both die.
{22:27} They will never return to the land they long to return to.”
{22:28} Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered pot, a jar no one wants? Why are he and his descendants hurled out and cast into a land they have not known?
{22:29} Earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord!
{22:30} This is what the Lord says: Record this man as childless, a man who will not be successful in his lifetime. None of his descendants will succeed in sitting on the throne of David or ruling again in Judah.
{i23:1} The Lord and His Sheep
{23:1} “Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture!” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{23:2} “Therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says about the shepherds who shepherd My people: You have scattered My flock, banished them, and have not attended to them. I will attend to you because of your evil acts” — this is the Lord’s declaration.
{23:3} “I will gather the remnant of My flock from all the lands where I have banished them, and I will return them to their grazing land. They will become fruitful and numerous.
{23:4} I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them. They will no longer be afraid or dismayed, nor will any be missing.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{i23:5} The Righteous Branch of David
{23:5} “The days are coming” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “when I will raise up a Righteous Branch of David. He will reign wisely as king and administer justice and righteousness in the land.
{23:6} In His days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. This is what He will be named: Yahweh Our Righteousness.
{23:7} “The days are coming” — the Lord’s declaration — “when it will no longer be said, ‘As the Lord lives who brought the Israelites from the land of Egypt,’
{23:8} but, ‘As the Lord lives, who brought and led the descendants of the house of Israel from the land of the north and from all the other countries where I had banished them.’ They will dwell once more in their own land.”
{i23:9} False Prophets Condemned
{23:9} Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me, and all my bones tremble. I have become like a drunkard, like a man overcome by wine, because of the Lord, because of His holy words.
{23:10} For the land is full of adulterers; the land mourns because of the curse, and the grazing lands in the wilderness have dried up. Their way of life has become evil, and their power is not rightly used
{23:11} because both prophet and priest are ungodly, even in My house I have found their evil. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{23:12} Therefore, their way will be to them like slippery paths in the gloom. They will be driven away and fall down there, for I will bring disaster on them, the year of their punishment. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{23:13} Among the prophets of Samaria I saw something disgusting: They prophesied by Baal and led My people Israel astray.
{23:14} Among the prophets of Jerusalem also I saw a horrible thing: They commit adultery and walk in lies. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, and none turns his back on evil. They are all like Sodom to Me; Jerusalem’s residents are like Gomorrah.
{23:15} Therefore, this is what the Lord of Hosts says concerning the prophets: I am about to feed them wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink, for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land.
{23:16} This is what the Lord of Hosts says: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They are making you worthless. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the Lord’s mouth.
{23:17} They keep on saying to those who despise Me, ‘The Lord has said: You will have peace.’ They have said to everyone who follows the stubbornness of his heart, ‘No harm will come to you.’”
{23:18} For who has stood in the council of the Lord to see and hear His word? Who has paid attention to His word and obeyed?
{23:19} Look, a storm from the Lord! Wrath has gone out, a whirling storm. It will whirl about the heads of the wicked.
{23:20} The Lord’s anger will not turn back until He has completely fulfilled the purposes of His heart. In time to come you will understand it clearly.
{23:21} I did not send these prophets, yet they ran with a message. I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.
{23:22} If they had really stood in My council, they would have enabled My people to hear My words and would have turned them back from their evil ways and their evil deeds.
{23:23} “Am I a God who is only near” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “and not a God who is far away?
{23:24} Can a man hide himself in secret places where I cannot see him?” — the Lord’s declaration. “Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?” — the Lord’s declaration.
{23:25} “I have heard what the prophets who prophesy a lie in My name have said, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’
{23:26} How long will this continue in the minds of the prophets prophesying lies, prophets of the deceit of their own minds?
{23:27} Through their dreams that they tell one another, they plan to cause My people to forget My name as their fathers forgot My name through Baal worship.
{23:28} The prophet who has only a dream should recount the dream, but the one who has My word should speak My word truthfully, for what is straw compared to grain?” — this is the Lord’s declaration.
{23:29} “Is not My word like fire” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “and like a hammer that pulverizes rock?
{23:30} Therefore, take note! I am against the prophets” — the Lord’s declaration — “who steal My words from each other.
{23:31} I am against the prophets” — the Lord’s declaration — “who use their own tongues to make a declaration.
{23:32} I am against those who prophesy false dreams” — the Lord’s declaration — “telling them and leading My people astray with their falsehoods and their boasting. It was not I who sent or commanded them, and they are of no benefit at all to these people” — this is the Lord’s declaration.
{i23:33} The Burden of the Lord
{23:33} “Now when these people or a prophet or a priest asks you, ‘What is the burden of the Lord?’ you will respond to them: What is the burden? I will throw you away” — this is the Lord’s declaration.
{23:34} “As for the prophet, priest, or people who say, ‘The burden of the Lord,’ I will punish that man and his household.
{23:35} This is what each man is to say to his friend and to his brother, ‘What has the Lord answered?’ or ‘What has the Lord spoken?’
{23:36} But no longer refer to the burden of the Lord, for each man’s word becomes his burden and you pervert the words of the living God, the Lord of Hosts, our God.
{23:37} You must say to the prophet: What has the Lord answered you? and What has the Lord spoken?
{23:38} But if you say, ‘The burden of the Lord,’ then this is what the Lord says: Because you have said, ‘The burden of the Lord,’ and I specifically told you not to say, ‘The burden of the Lord,’
{23:39} I will surely forget you and throw away from My presence both you and the city that I gave you and your fathers.
{23:40} I will bring on you everlasting shame and humiliation that will never be forgotten.”
{i24:1} The Good and the Bad Figs
{24:1} After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had deported Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, the officials of Judah, and the craftsmen and metalsmiths from Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon, the Lord showed me two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the Lord.
{24:2} One basket contained very good figs, like early figs, but the other basket contained very bad figs, so bad they were inedible.
{24:3} The Lord said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I said, “Figs! The good figs are very good, but the bad figs are extremely bad, so bad they are inedible.”
{24:4} The word of the Lord came to me:
{24:5} “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Like these good figs, so I regard as good the exiles from Judah I sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans.
{24:6} I will keep My eyes on them for their good and will return them to this land. I will build them up and not demolish them; I will plant them and not uproot them.
{24:7} I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am Yahweh. They will be My people, and I will be their God because they will return to Me with all their heart.
{24:8} “But as for the bad figs, so bad they are inedible, this is what the Lord says: in this way I will deal with king Zedekiah of Judah, his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem — those remaining in this land and those living in the land of Egypt.
{24:9} I will make them an object of horror and disaster to all the kingdoms of the earth, a disgrace, an object of scorn, ridicule, and cursing, wherever I have banished them.
{24:10} I will send the sword, famine, and plague against them until they have perished from the land I gave to them and their ancestors.”
{i25:1} The Seventy-Year Exile
{25:1} This is the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah (which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon).
{25:2} The prophet Jeremiah spoke concerning all the people of Judah and all the residents of Jerusalem as follows:
{25:3} “From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, until this very day — 23 years — the word of the Lord has come to me, and I have spoken to you time and time again, but you have not obeyed.
{25:4} The Lord sent all His servants the prophets to you time and time again, but you have not obeyed or even paid attention.
{25:5} He announced, ‘Turn, each of you, from your evil way of life and from your evil deeds. Live in the land the Lord gave to you and your ancestors long ago and forever.
{25:6} Do not follow other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger by the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.
{25:7} “‘But you would not obey Me’ — this is the Lord’s declaration — ‘in order that you might provoke Me to anger by the work of your hands and bring disaster on yourselves.’
{25:8} “Therefore, this is what the Lord of Hosts says: ‘Because you have not obeyed My words,
{25:9} I am going to send for all the families of the north’ — this is the Lord’s declaration — ‘and send for My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will bring them against this land, against its residents, and against all these surrounding nations, and I will completely destroy them and make them a desolation, a derision, and ruins forever.
{25:10} I will eliminate the sound of joy and gladness from them — the voice of the groom and the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.
{25:11} This whole land will become a desolate ruin, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for 70 years.
{25:12} When the 70 years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation’ — this is the Lord’s declaration — ‘the land of the Chaldeans, for their guilt, and I will make it a ruin forever.
{25:13} I will bring on that land all My words I have spoken against it, all that is written in this book that Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations.
{25:14} For many nations and great kings will enslave them, and I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.’”
{i25:15} The Cup of God’s Wrath
{25:15} This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand and make all the nations I am sending you to, drink from it.
{25:16} They will drink, stagger, and go out of their minds because of the sword I am sending among them.”
{25:17} So I took the cup from the Lord’s hand and made all the nations drink from it, everyone the Lord sent me to.
{25:18} These included: Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah, its kings and its officials, to make them a desolate ruin, an object of scorn and cursing — as it is today;
{25:19} Pharaoh king of Egypt, his officers, his leaders, all his people,
{25:20} and all the mixed peoples; all the kings of the land of Uz; all the kings of the land of the Philistines — Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
{25:21} Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites;
{25:22} all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastlands across the sea;
{25:23} Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all those who shave their temples;
{25:24} all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed peoples who have settled in the desert;
{25:25} all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;
{25:26} all the kings of the north, both near and far from one another; that is, all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth. Finally, the king of Sheshach will drink after them.
{25:27} “Then you are to say to them: This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Drink, get drunk, and vomit. Fall down and never get up again, as a result of the sword I am sending among you.
{25:28} If they refuse to take the cup from you and drink, you are to say to them: This is what the Lord of Hosts says: You must drink!
{25:29} For I am already bringing disaster on the city that bears My name, so how could you possibly go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth” — this is the declaration of the Lord of Hosts.
{i25:30} Judgment on the Whole World
{25:30} “As for you, you are to prophesy all these things to them, and say to them: The Lord roars from heaven; He raises His voice from His holy dwelling. He roars loudly over His grazing land; He calls out with a shout, like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
{25:31} The tumult reaches to the ends of the earth because the Lord brings a case against the nations. He enters into judgment with all flesh. As for the wicked, He hands them over to the sword — this is the Lord’s declaration.
{25:32} “This is what the Lord of Hosts says: Pay attention! Disaster spreads from nation to nation. A great storm is stirred up from the ends of the earth.”
{25:33} Those slain by the Lord on that day will be spread from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned, gathered, or buried. They will be like manure on the surface of the ground.
{25:34} Wail, you shepherds, and cry out. Roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock. Because the days of your slaughter have come, you will fall and become shattered like a precious vase.
{25:35} Flight will be impossible for the shepherds, and escape, for the leaders of the flock.
{25:36} Hear the sound of the shepherds’ cry, the wail of the leaders of the flock, for the Lord is destroying their pasture.
{25:37} Peaceful grazing land will become lifeless because of the Lord’s burning anger.
{25:38} He has left His den like a lion, for their land has become a desolation because of the sword of the oppressor, because of His burning anger.
{i26:1} Jeremiah’s Speech in the Temple
{26:1} At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the Lord:
{26:2} “This is what the Lord says: Stand in the courtyard of the Lord’s temple and speak all the words I have commanded you to speak to all Judah’s cities that are coming to worship there. Do not hold back a word.
{26:3} Perhaps they will listen and return — each from his evil way of life — so that I might relent concerning the disaster that I plan to do to them because of the evil of their deeds.
{26:4} You are to say to them: This is what the Lord says: If you do not listen to Me by living according to My instruction that I set before you
{26:5} and by listening to the words of My servants the prophets I have been sending you time and time again, though you did not listen,
{26:6} I will make this temple like Shiloh. I will make this city an object of cursing for all the nations of the earth.”
{i26:7} Jeremiah Seized
{26:7} The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the temple of the Lord.
{26:8} He finished the address the Lord had commanded him to deliver to all the people. Then the priests, the prophets, and all the people took hold of him, yelling, “You must surely die!
{26:9} How dare you prophesy in the name of Yahweh, ‘This temple will become like Shiloh and this city will become an uninhabited ruin’!” Then all the people assembled against Jeremiah at the Lord’s temple.
{26:10} When the officials of Judah heard these things, they went from the king’s palace to the Lord’s temple and sat at the entrance of the New Gate.
{26:11} Then the priests and prophets said to the officials and all the people, “This man deserves the death sentence because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears.”
{i26:12} Jeremiah’s Defense
{26:12} Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and the people, “The Lord sent me to prophesy all the words that you have heard against this temple and city.
{26:13} So now, correct your ways and deeds and obey the voice of the Lord your God so that He might relent concerning the disaster that He warned about.
{26:14} As for me, here I am in your hands; do to me what you think is good and right.
{26:15} But know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its residents, for it is certain the Lord has sent me to speak all these things directly to you.”
{i26:16} Jeremiah Released
{26:16} Then the officials and all the people told the priests and prophets, “This man doesn’t deserve the death sentence, for he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God!”
{26:17} Some of the elders of the land stood up and said to all the assembled people,
{26:18} “Micah the Moreshite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah and said to all the people of Judah, ‘This is what the Lord of Hosts says: Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become ruins, and the temple mount a forested hill.’
{26:19} Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all the people of Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the Lord and plead for the Lord’s favor, and did not the Lord relent concerning the disaster He had pronounced against them? We are about to bring great harm on ourselves!”
{i26:20} The Prophet Uriah
{26:20} Another man was also prophesying in the name of Yahweh — Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this land in words like all those of Jeremiah.
{26:21} King Jehoiakim, all his warriors, and all the officials heard his words, and the king tried to put him to death. When Uriah heard, he fled in fear and went to Egypt.
{26:22} But King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt: Elnathan son of Achbor and certain other men with him went to Egypt.
{26:23} They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who executed him with the sword and threw his corpse into the burial place of the common people.
{26:24} But Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death.
{i27:1} The Yoke of Babylon
{27:1} At the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
{27:2} “This is what the Lord said to me: Make chains and yoke bars for yourself and put them on your neck.
{27:3} Send word to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon through messengers who are coming to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem.
{27:4} Command them to go to their masters, saying: This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: This is what you must say to your masters:
{27:5} By My great strength and outstretched arm, I made the earth, and the people, and animals on the face of the earth. I give it to anyone I please.
{27:6} So now I have placed all these lands under the authority of My servant Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. I have even given him the wild animals to serve him.
{27:7} All nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson until the time for his own land comes, and then many nations and great kings will enslave him.
{27:8} “As for the nation or kingdom that does not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and does not place its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish by sword, famine, and plague” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “until through him I have destroyed it.
{27:9} But as for you, do not listen to your prophets, diviners, dreamers, fortune-tellers, or sorcerers who say to you, ‘Don’t serve the king of Babylon!’
{27:10} for they prophesy a lie to you so that you will be removed from your land. I will banish you, and you will perish.
{27:11} But as for the nation that will put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave it in its own land, and that nation will cultivate it and reside in it.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{i27:12} Warning to Zedekiah
{27:12} I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah in the same way: “Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, serve him and his people, and live!
{27:13} Why should you and your people die by the sword, famine, or plague as the Lord has threatened against any nation that does not serve the king of Babylon?
{27:14} Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are telling you, ‘You must not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying a lie to you.
{27:15} ‘I have not sent them’ — this is the Lord’s declaration — ‘and they are prophesying falsely in My name; therefore, I will banish you, and you will perish — you and the prophets who are prophesying to you.’”
{27:16} Then I spoke to the priests and all these people, saying, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Do not listen to the words of your prophets. They are prophesying to you, claiming, “Look, very soon now the articles of the Lord’s temple will be brought back from Babylon.” They are prophesying a lie to you.
{27:17} Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon and live! Why should this city become a ruin?
{27:18} If they are indeed prophets and if the word of the Lord is with them, let them intercede with the Lord of Hosts not to let the articles that remain in the Lord’s temple, in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem go to Babylon.’
{27:19} For this is what the Lord of Hosts says about the pillars, the sea, the water carts, and the rest of the articles that still remain in this city,
{27:20} those Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he deported Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem.
{27:21} Yes, this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says about the articles that remain in the temple of the Lord, in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:
{27:22} ‘They will be brought to Babylon and will remain there until I attend to them again.’ This is the Lord’s declaration. ‘Then I will bring them up and restore them to this place.’”
{i28:1} Hananiah’s False Prophecy
{28:1} In that same year, at the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur from Gibeon said to me in the temple of the Lord in the presence of the priests and all the people,
{28:2} “This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
{28:3} Within two years I will restore to this place all the articles of the Lord’s temple that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took from here and transported to Babylon.
{28:4} And I will restore to this place Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon’ — this is the Lord’s declaration — ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’”
{i28:5} Jeremiah’s Response to Hananiah
{28:5} The prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the temple of the Lord.
{28:6} The prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May the Lord do so. May the Lord make the words you have prophesied come true and may He restore the articles of the Lord’s temple and all the exiles from Babylon to this place!
{28:7} Only listen to this message I am speaking in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.
{28:8} The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war, disaster, and plague against many lands and great kingdoms.
{28:9} As for the prophet who prophesies peace — only when the word of the prophet comes true will the prophet be recognized as one the Lord has truly sent.”
{i28:10} Hananiah Breaks Jeremiah’s Yoke
{28:10} The prophet Hananiah then took the yoke bar from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it.
{28:11} In the presence of all the people Hananiah proclaimed, “This is what the Lord says: ‘In this way, within two years I will break the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon from the neck of all the nations.’” Jeremiah the prophet then went on his way.
{i28:12} The Lord ’s Word against Hananiah
{28:12} The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke bar from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet:
{28:13} “Go say to Hananiah: This is what the Lord says, ‘You broke a wooden yoke bar, but in its place you will make an iron yoke bar.’
{28:14} For this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says, ‘I have put an iron yoke on the neck of all these nations that they might serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and they will serve him. I have also put the wild animals under him.’”
{28:15} The prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah! The Lord did not send you, but you have led these people to trust in a lie.
{28:16} Therefore, this is what the Lord says: ‘I am about to send you off the face of the earth. You will die this year because you have spoken rebellion against the Lord.’”
{28:17} And the prophet Hananiah died that year in the seventh month.
{i29:1} Jeremiah’s Letter to the Exiles
{29:1} This is the text of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the exiles, the priests, the prophets, and all the people Nebuchadnezzar had deported from Jerusalem to Babylon.
{29:2} This was after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the court officials, the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metalsmiths had left Jerusalem.
{29:3} The letter was sent by Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah whom Zedekiah king of Judah had sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. The letter stated:
{29:4} This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says to all the exiles I deported from Jerusalem to Babylon:
{29:5} “Build houses and live in them. Plant gardens and eat their produce.
{29:6} Take wives and have sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons and give your daughters to men in marriage so that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there; do not decrease.
{29:7} Seek the welfare of the city I have deported you to. Pray to the Lord on its behalf, for when it has prosperity, you will prosper.”
{29:8} For this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Don’t let your prophets who are among you and your diviners deceive you, and don’t listen to the dreams you elicit from them,
{29:9} for they are prophesying falsely to you in My name. I have not sent them.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{29:10} For this is what the Lord says: “When 70 years for Babylon are complete, I will attend to you and will confirm My promise concerning you to restore you to this place.
{29:11} For I know the plans I have for you” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “plans for your welfare, not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.
{29:12} You will call to Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.
{29:13} You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.
{29:14} I will be found by you” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and places where I banished you” — this is the Lord’s declaration. “I will restore you to the place I deported you from.”
{29:15} You have said, “The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon!”
{29:16} But this is what the Lord says concerning the king sitting on David’s throne and concerning all the people living in this city — that is, concerning your brothers who did not go with you into exile.
{29:17} This is what the Lord of Hosts says: “I am about to send against them sword, famine, and plague and will make them like rotten figs that are inedible because they are so bad.
{29:18} I will pursue them with sword, famine, and plague. I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth — a curse and a desolation, an object of scorn and a disgrace among all the nations where I have banished them.
{29:19} I will do this because they have not listened to My words” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “that I sent to them with My servants the prophets time and time again. And you too have not listened.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{29:20} Hear the word of the Lord, all you exiles I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon.
{29:21} This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says to Ahab son of Kolaiah and to Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, the ones prophesying a lie to you in My name: “I am about to hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will kill them before your very eyes.
{29:22} Based on what happens to them, all the exiles of Judah who are in Babylon will create a curse that says, ‘May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire!’
{29:23} because they have committed an outrage in Israel by committing adultery with their neighbors’ wives and have spoken a lie in My name, which I did not command them. I am He who knows, and I am a witness.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{29:24} To Shemaiah the Nehelamite you are to say,
{29:25} “This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: You in your own name have sent out letters to all the people of Jerusalem, to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, and to all the priests, saying:
{29:26} ‘The Lord has appointed you priest in place of Jehoiada the priest to be the chief officer in the temple of the Lord, responsible for every madman who acts like a prophet. You must confine him in the stocks and an iron collar.
{29:27} So now, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who has been acting like a prophet among you?
{29:28} For he has sent word to us in Babylon, claiming, “The exile will be long. Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat their produce.”’”
{29:29} Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
{i29:30} A Message about Shemaiah
{29:30} Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
{29:31} “Send a message to all the exiles, saying: This is what the Lord says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite. Because Shemaiah prophesied to you, though I did not send him, and made you trust a lie,
{29:32} this is what the Lord says: I am about to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. There will not be even one of his descendants living among these people, nor will any ever see the good that I will bring to My people” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “for he has preached rebellion against the Lord.”
{i30:1} Restoration from Captivity
{30:1} This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord.
{30:2} This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: “Write down on a scroll all the words that I have spoken to you,
{30:3} for the days are certainly coming” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah” — the Lord’s declaration. “I will restore them to the land I gave to their ancestors and they will possess it.”
{30:4} These are the words the Lord spoke to Israel and Judah.
{30:5} Yes, this is what the Lord says: We have heard a cry of terror, of dread — there is no peace.
{30:6} Ask and see whether a male can give birth. Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor and every face turned pale?
{30:7} How awful that day will be! There will be none like it! It will be a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be delivered out of it.
{30:8} “On that day” — this is the declaration of the Lord of Hosts — “I will break his yoke from your neck and tear off your chains so strangers will never again enslave him.
{30:9} They will serve the Lord their God and I will raise up David their king for them.”
{30:10} As for you, My servant Jacob, do not be afraid — this is the Lord’s declaration — and do not be dismayed, Israel, for without fail I will save you from far away, your descendants, from the land of their captivity! Jacob will return and have calm and quiet with no one to frighten him.
{30:11} For I will be with you — this is the Lord’s declaration — to save you! I will bring destruction on all the nations where I have scattered you; however, I will not bring destruction on you. I will discipline you justly, and I will by no means leave you unpunished.
{i30:12} Healing Zion’s Wounds
{30:12} For this is what the Lord says: Your injury is incurable; your wound most severe.
{30:13} No one takes up the case for your sores. There is no healing for you.
{30:14} All your lovers have forgotten you; they no longer look for you, for I have struck you as an enemy would, with the discipline of someone cruel, because of your enormous guilt and your innumerable sins.
{30:15} Why do you cry out about your injury? Your pain has no cure! I have done these things to you because of your enormous guilt and your innumerable sins.
{30:16} Nevertheless, all who devoured you will be devoured, and all your adversaries — all of them — will go off into exile. Those who plunder you will be plundered, and all who raid you will be raided.
{30:17} But I will bring you health and will heal you of your wounds — this is the Lord’s declaration — for they call you Outcast, Zion whom no one cares about.
{i30:18} Restoration of the Land
{30:18} This is what the Lord says: I will certainly restore the fortunes of Jacob’s tents and show compassion on his dwellings. Every city will be rebuilt on its mound; every citadel will stand on its proper site.
{30:19} Thanksgiving will come out of them, a sound of celebration. I will multiply them, and they will not decrease; I will honor them, and they will not be insignificant.
{30:20} His children will be as in past days; his congregation will be established in My presence. I will punish all his oppressors.
{30:21} Jacob’s leader will be one of them; his ruler will issue from him. I will invite him to Me, and he will approach Me, for who would otherwise risk his life to approach Me? This is the Lord’s declaration.
{30:22} You will be My people, and I will be your God.
{i30:23} The Wrath of God
{30:23} Look, a storm from the Lord! Wrath has gone out, a churning storm. It will whirl about the heads of the wicked.
{30:24} The Lord’s burning anger will not turn back until He has completely fulfilled the purposes of His heart. In time to come you will understand it.
{i31:1} God’s Relationship with His People
{31:1} “At that time” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be My people.”
{31:2} This is what the Lord says: They found favor in the wilderness — the people who survived the sword. When Israel went to find rest,
{31:3} the Lord appeared to him from far away. I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore, I have continued to extend faithful love to you.
{31:4} Again I will build you so that you will be rebuilt, Virgin Israel. You will take up your tambourines again and go out in joyful dancing.
{31:5} You will plant vineyards again on the mountains of Samaria; the planters will plant and will enjoy the fruit.
{31:6} For there will be a day when watchmen will call out in the hill country of Ephraim, “Get up, let’s go up to Zion, to Yahweh our God!”
{i31:7} God’s People Brought Home
{31:7} For this is what the Lord says: Sing with joy for Jacob; shout for the chief of the nations! Proclaim, praise, and say, “Lord, save Your people, the remnant of Israel!”
{31:8} Watch! I am going to bring them from the northern land. I will gather them from remote regions of the earth — the blind and the lame will be with them, along with those who are pregnant and those about to give birth. They will return here as a great assembly!
{31:9} They will come weeping, but I will bring them back with consolation. I will lead them to wadis filled with water by a smooth way where they will not stumble, for I am Israel’s Father, and Ephraim is My firstborn.
{31:10} Nations, hear the word of the Lord, and tell it among the far off coastlands! Say: The One who scattered Israel will gather him. He will watch over him as a shepherd guards his flock,
{31:11} for the Lord has ransomed Jacob and redeemed him from the power of one stronger than he.
{31:12} They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will be radiant with joy because of the Lord’s goodness, because of the grain, the new wine, the fresh oil, and because of the young of the flocks and herds. Their life will be like an irrigated garden, and they will no longer grow weak from hunger.
{31:13} Then the young woman will rejoice with dancing, while young and old men rejoice together. I will turn their mourning into joy, give them consolation, and bring happiness out of grief.
{31:14} I will refresh the priests with an abundance, and My people will be satisfied with My goodness. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{i31:15} Lament Turned to Joy
{31:15} This is what the Lord says: A voice was heard in Ramah, a lament with bitter weeping — Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted for her children because they are no more.
{31:16} This is what the Lord says: Keep your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for the reward for your work will come — this is the Lord’s declaration — and your children will return from the enemy’s land.
{31:17} There is hope for your future — this is the Lord’s declaration — and your children will return to their own territory.
{31:18} I have heard Ephraim moaning, “You disciplined me, and I have been disciplined like an untrained calf. Restore me, and I will return, for you, Lord, are my God.
{31:19} After I returned, I repented; After I was instructed, I struck my thigh in grief. I was ashamed and humiliated because I bore the disgrace of my youth.”
{31:20} Isn’t Ephraim a precious son to Me, a delightful child? Whenever I speak against him, I certainly still think about him. Therefore, My inner being yearns for him; I will truly have compassion on him. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{i31:21} Repentance and Restoration
{31:21} Set up road markers for yourself; establish signposts! Keep the highway in mind, the way you have traveled. Return, Virgin Israel! Return to these cities of yours.
{31:22} How long will you turn here and there, faithless daughter? For the Lord creates something new in the land — a female will shelter a man.
{31:23} This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “When I restore their fortunes, they will once again speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities, ‘May the Lord bless you, righteous settlement, holy mountain.’
{31:24} Judah and all its cities will live in it together — also farmers and those who move with the flocks —
{31:25} for I satisfy the thirsty person and feed all those who are weak.”
{31:26} At this I awoke and looked around. My sleep had been most pleasant to me.
{31:27} “The days are coming” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and the seed of beast.
{31:28} Just as I watched over them to uproot and to tear them down, to demolish and to destroy, and to cause disaster, so will I be attentive to build and to plant them,” says the Lord.
{31:29} “In those days, it will never again be said: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.
{31:30} Rather, each will die for his own wrongdoing. Anyone who eats sour grapes — his own teeth will be set on edge.
{i31:31} The New Covenant
{31:31} “Look, the days are coming” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.
{31:32} This one will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt — a covenant they broke even though I had married them” — the Lord’s declaration.
{31:33} “Instead, this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days” — the Lord’s declaration. “I will put My teaching within them and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be My people.
{31:34} No longer will one teach his neighbor or his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they will all know Me, from the least to the greatest of them” — this is the Lord’s declaration. “For I will forgive their wrongdoing and never again remember their sin.
{31:35} This is what the Lord says: The One who gives the sun for light by day, the fixed order of moon and stars for light by night, who stirs up the sea and makes its waves roar — Yahweh of Hosts is His name:
{31:36} If this fixed order departs from My presence — this is the Lord’s declaration — then also Israel’s descendants will cease to be a nation before Me forever.
{31:37} This is what the Lord says: If the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below explored, I will reject all of Israel’s descendants because of all they have done — this is the Lord’s declaration.
{31:38} “Look, the days are coming” — the Lord’s declaration — “when the city from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate will be rebuilt for the Lord.
{31:39} A measuring line will once again stretch out straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn toward Goah.
{31:40} The whole valley — the corpses, the ashes, and all the fields as far as the Kidron Valley to the corner of the Horse Gate to the east — will be holy to the Lord. It will never be uprooted or demolished again.”
{i32:1} Jeremiah’s Land Purchase
{32:1} This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
{32:2} At that time, the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was imprisoned in the guard’s courtyard in the palace of the king of Judah.
{32:3} Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying: “Why are you prophesying, ‘This is what the Lord says: Look, I am about to hand this city over to Babylon’s king, and he will capture it.
{32:4} Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the Chaldeans; indeed, he will certainly be handed over to Babylon’s king. They will speak face to face and meet eye to eye.
{32:5} He will take Zedekiah to Babylon where he will stay until I attend to him’ — this is the Lord’s declaration. ‘You will fight the Chaldeans, but you will not succeed’?”
{32:6} Jeremiah replied, “The word of the Lord came to me:
{32:7} Watch! Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, is coming to you to say, ‘Buy my field in Anathoth for yourself, for you own the right of redemption to buy it.’
{32:8} “Then my cousin Hanamel came to the guard’s courtyard as the Lord had said and urged me, ‘Please buy my field in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for you own the right of inheritance and redemption. Buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord.
{32:9} So I bought the field in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, and I weighed out to him the money — 17 shekels of silver.
{32:10} I recorded it on a scroll, sealed it, called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver in the scales.
{32:11} I took the purchase agreement — the sealed copy with its terms and conditions and the open copy —
{32:12} and gave the purchase agreement to Baruch son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah. I did this in the sight of my cousin Hanamel, the witnesses who were signing the purchase agreement, and all the Judeans sitting in the guard’s courtyard.
{32:13} “I instructed Baruch in their sight,
{32:14} ‘This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Take these scrolls — this purchase agreement with the sealed copy and this open copy — and put them in an earthen storage jar so they will last a long time.
{32:15} For this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought in this land.’
{32:16} “After I had given the purchase agreement to Baruch, son of Neriah, I prayed to the Lord:
{32:17} Oh, Lord God! You Yourself made the heavens and earth by Your great power and with Your outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for You!
{32:18} You show faithful love to thousands but lay the fathers’ sins on their sons’ laps after them, great and mighty God whose name is Yahweh of Hosts,
{32:19} the One great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are on all the ways of the sons of men in order to give to each person according to his ways and the result of his deeds.
{32:20} You performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt and do so to this very day both in Israel and among mankind. You made a name for Yourself, as is the case today.
{32:21} You brought Your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror.
{32:22} You gave them this land You swore to give to their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey.
{32:23} They entered and possessed it, but they did not obey Your voice or live according to Your instructions. They failed to perform all You commanded them to do, and so You have brought all this disaster on them.
{32:24} Look! Siege ramps have come against the city to capture it, and the city, as a result of the sword, famine, and plague, has been handed over to the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What You have spoken has happened. Look, You can see it!
{32:25} Yet You, Lord God, have said to me: Buy the field with silver and call in witnesses — even though the city has been handed over to the Chaldeans!”
{32:26} Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
{32:27} “Look, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh. Is anything too difficult for Me?
{32:28} Therefore, this is what the Lord says: I am about to hand this city over to the Chaldeans, to Babylon’s king Nebuchadnezzar, and he will capture it.
{32:29} The Chaldeans who are going to fight against this city will come, set this city on fire, and burn it along with the houses where incense has been burned to Baal on their rooftops and where drink offerings have been poured out to other gods to provoke Me to anger.
{32:30} From their youth, the Israelites and Judeans have done nothing but what is evil in My sight! They have done nothing but provoke Me to anger by the work of their hands” — this is the Lord’s declaration —
{32:31} “for this city has caused My wrath and fury from the day it was built until now. I will therefore remove it from My presence,
{32:32} because of all the evil the Israelites and Judeans have done to provoke Me to anger — they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets, the men of Judah, and the residents of Jerusalem.
{32:33} They have turned their backs to Me and not their faces. Though I taught them time and time again, they do not listen and receive discipline.
{32:34} They have placed their detestable things in the house that is called by My name and have defiled it.
{32:35} They have built the high places of Baal in the Valley of Hinnom to make their sons and daughters pass through the fire to Molech — something I had not commanded them. I had never entertained the thought that they do this detestable act causing Judah to sin!
{32:36} “Now therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to this city about which you said, ‘It has been handed over to Babylon’s king through sword, famine, and plague’:
{32:37} I am about to gather them from all the lands where I have banished them in My anger, rage and great wrath, and I will return them to this place and make them live in safety.
{32:38} They will be My people, and I will be their God.
{32:39} I will give them one heart and one way so that for their good and for the good of their descendants after them, they will fear Me always.
{32:40} “I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never turn away from doing good to them, and I will put fear of Me in their hearts so they will never again turn away from Me.
{32:41} I will take delight in them to do what is good for them, and with all My heart and mind I will faithfully plant them in this land.
{32:42} “For this is what the Lord says: Just as I have brought all this great disaster on these people, so am I about to bring on them all the good I am promising them.
{32:43} Fields will be bought in this land about which you are saying, ‘It’s a desolation without man or beast; it has been handed over to the Chaldeans!’
{32:44} Fields will be purchased with silver, the transaction written on a scroll and sealed, and witnesses will be called on in the land of Benjamin, in the areas surrounding Jerusalem, and in Judah’s cities — the cities of the hill country, the cities of the Judean foothills, and the cities of the Negev — because I will restore their fortunes.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{i33:1} Israel’s Restoration
{33:1} While he was still confined in the guard’s courtyard, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah a second time:
{33:2} “The Lord who made the earth, the Lord who forms it to establish it, Yahweh is His name, says this:
{33:3} Call to Me and I will answer you and tell you great and incomprehensible things you do not know.
{33:4} For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says concerning the houses of this city and the palaces of Judah’s kings, the ones torn down for defense against the siege ramps and the sword:
{33:5} The people coming to fight the Chaldeans will fill the houses with the corpses of their own men that I strike down in My wrath and rage. I have hidden My face from this city because of all their evil.
{33:6} Yet I will certainly bring health and healing to it and will indeed heal them. I will let them experience the abundance of peace and truth.
{33:7} I will restore the fortunes of Judah and of Israel and will rebuild them as in former times.
{33:8} I will purify them from all the wrongs they have committed against Me, and I will forgive all the wrongs they have committed against Me, rebelling against Me.
{33:9} This city will bear on My behalf a name of joy, praise, and glory before all the nations of the earth, who will hear of all the good I will do for them. They will tremble with awe because of all the good and all the peace I will bring about for them.
{33:10} “This is what the Lord says: In this place, which you say is a ruin, without man or beast — that is, in Judah’s cities and Jerusalem’s streets that are a desolation without man, without inhabitant, and without beast — there will be heard again
{33:11} a sound of joy and gladness, the voice of the groom and the bride, and the voice of those saying, Praise the Lord of Hosts, for the Lord is good; His faithful love endures forever as they bring thank offerings to the temple of the Lord. For I will restore the fortunes of the land as in former times, says the Lord.
{33:12} “This is what the Lord of Hosts says: In this desolate place — without man or beast — and in all its cities there will once more be a grazing land where shepherds may rest flocks.
{33:13} The flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who counts them in the cities of the hill country, the cities of the Judean foothills, the cities of the Negev, the land of Benjamin — the cities surrounding Jerusalem and Judah’s cities, says the Lord.
{i33:14} God’s Covenant with David
{33:14} “Look, the days are coming” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “when I will fulfill the good promises that I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
{33:15} In those days and at that time I will cause a Righteous Branch to sprout up for David, and He will administer justice and righteousness in the land.
{33:16} In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely, and this is what she will be named: Yahweh Our Righteousness.
{33:17} “For this is what the Lord says: David will never fail to have a man sitting on the throne of the house of Israel.
{33:18} The Levitical priests will never fail to have a man always before Me to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to make sacrifices.”
{33:19} The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
{33:20} “This is what the Lord says: If you can break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night so that day and night cease to come at their regular time,
{33:21} then also My covenant with My servant David may be broken so that he will not have a son reigning on his throne, and the Levitical priests will not be My ministers.
{33:22} The hosts of heaven cannot be counted; the sand of the sea cannot be measured. So, too, I will make the descendants of My servant David and the Levites who minister to Me innumerable.”
{33:23} The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
{33:24} “Have you not noticed what these people have said? They say, ‘The Lord has rejected the two families He had chosen.’ My people are treated with contempt and no longer regarded as a nation among them.
{33:25} This is what the Lord says: If I do not keep My covenant with the day and with the night and fail to establish the fixed order of heaven and earth,
{33:26} then I might also reject the seed of Jacob and of My servant David — not taking from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Instead, I will restore their fortunes and have compassion on them.”
{i34:1} Jeremiah’s Word to King Zedekiah
{34:1} This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, all his army, all the earthly kingdoms under his control, and all other nations were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding cities:
{34:2} “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Go, speak to Zedekiah, king of Judah, and tell him: This is what the Lord says: I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down.
{34:3} As for you, you will not escape from his hand but are certain to be captured and handed over to him. You will meet the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak face to face; you will go to Babylon.
{34:4} “Yet hear the Lord’s word, Zedekiah, king of Judah. This is what the Lord says concerning you: You will not die by the sword;
{34:5} you will die peacefully. There will be a burning ceremony for you just like the burning ceremonies for your fathers, the former kings who preceded you. ‘Our king is dead!’ will be the lament for you, for I have spoken this word.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{34:6} So Jeremiah the prophet related all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem
{34:7} while the king of Babylon’s army was attacking Jerusalem and all of Judah’s remaining cities — against Lachish and Azekah, for they were the only ones left of Judah’s fortified cities.
{i34:8} The People and Their Slaves
{34:8} This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah made a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom to them,
{34:9} so each man would free his male and female Hebrew slaves and no one would enslave his Judean brother.
{34:10} All the officials and people who entered into covenant to free their male and female slaves — in order not to enslave them any longer — obeyed and freed them.
{34:11} Afterward, however, they changed their minds and took back their male and female slaves they had freed and forced them to become slaves again.
{34:12} Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
{34:13} “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of slavery, saying:
{34:14} At the end of seven years, each of you must free his Hebrew brother who sold himself to you. He may serve you six years, but then you must send him out free from you. But your ancestors did not obey Me or pay any attention.
{34:15} Today you repented and did what pleased Me, each of you proclaiming freedom for his neighbor. You made a covenant before Me at the temple called by My name.
{34:16} But you have changed your minds and profaned My name. Each has taken back his male and female slaves who had been freed to go wherever they wanted, and you have again subjugated them to be your slaves.
{34:17} “Therefore, this is what the Lord says: You have not obeyed Me by proclaiming freedom, each man for his brother and for his neighbor. I hereby proclaim freedom for you” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “to the sword, to plague, and to famine! I will make you a horror to all the earth’s kingdoms.
{34:18} As for those who disobeyed My covenant, not keeping the terms of the covenant they made before Me, I will treat them like the calf they cut in two in order to pass between its pieces.
{34:19} The officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the pieces of the calf
{34:20} will be handed over to their enemies, to those who want to take their life. Their corpses will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the land.
{34:21} I will hand Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials over to their enemies, to those who want to take their lives, to the king of Babylon’s army that is withdrawing.
{34:22} I am about to give the command” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “and I will bring them back to this city. They will fight against it, capture it, and burn it down. I will make Judah’s cities a desolation, without inhabitant.”
{i35:1} The Rechabites’ Example
{35:1} This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:
{35:2} “Go to the house of the Rechabites, speak to them, and bring them to one of the chambers of the temple of the Lord to offer them a drink of wine.”
{35:3} So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons — the entire house of the Rechabites —
{35:4} and I brought them into the temple of the Lord to a chamber occupied by the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God, who had a chamber near the officials’ chamber, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper.
{35:5} I set jars filled with wine and some cups before the sons of the house of the Rechabites and said to them, “Drink wine!”
{35:6} But they replied, “We do not drink wine, for Jonadab, son of our ancestor Rechab, commanded: ‘You and your sons must never drink wine.
{35:7} You must not build a house or sow seed or plant a vineyard. Those things are not for you. Rather, you must live in tents your whole life, so you may live a long time on the soil where you stay as a temporary resident.’
{35:8} We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab, son of our ancestor Rechab, in all he commanded us. So we haven’t drunk wine our whole life — we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters.
{35:9} We also have not built houses to live in and do not have vineyard, field, or seed.
{35:10} But we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done as our ancestor Jonadab commanded us.
{35:11} However, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched into the land, we said: Come, let’s go into Jerusalem to get away from the Chaldean and Aramean armies. So we have been living in Jerusalem.”
{35:12} Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
{35:13} “This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Go, say to the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem: Will you not accept discipline by listening to My words?” — this is the Lord’s declaration.
{35:14} “The words of Jonadab, son of Rechab, have been carried out. He commanded his sons not to drink wine, and they have not drunk to this very day because they have obeyed their ancestor’s command. But I have spoken to you time and time again, and you have not obeyed Me!
{35:15} Time and time again I have sent you all My servants the prophets, proclaiming: Turn, each one from his evil way of life, and correct your actions. Stop following other gods to serve them. Live in the land that I gave you and your ancestors. But you would not pay attention or obey Me.
{35:16} Yes, the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab carried out their ancestor’s command he gave them, but these people have not obeyed Me.
{35:17} Therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I will certainly bring to Judah and to all the residents of Jerusalem all the disaster I have pronounced against them because I have spoken to them, but they have not obeyed, and I have called to them, but they would not answer.”
{35:18} Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites: “This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Because you have obeyed the command of your ancestor Jonadab and have kept all his commands and have done all that he commanded you,
{35:19} this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Jonadab son of Rechab will never fail to have a man to always stand before Me.’”
{i36:1} Jeremiah Dictates a Scroll
{36:1} In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord:
{36:2} “Take a scroll, and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah, and all the nations from the time I first spoke to you during Josiah’s reign until today.
{36:3} Perhaps when the house of Judah hears about all the disaster I am planning to bring on them, each one of them will turn from his evil way. Then I will forgive their wrongdoing and their sin.”
{36:4} So Jeremiah summoned Baruch son of Neriah. At Jeremiah’s dictation, Baruch wrote on a scroll all the words the Lord had spoken to Jeremiah.
{36:5} Then Jeremiah commanded Baruch, “I am restricted; I cannot enter the temple of the Lord,
{36:6} so you must go and read from the scroll — which you wrote at my dictation — the words of the Lord in the hearing of the people at the temple of the Lord on a day of fasting. You must also read them in the hearing of all the Judeans who are coming from their cities.
{36:7} Perhaps their petition will come before the Lord, and each one will turn from his evil way, for the anger and fury that the Lord has pronounced against this people are great.”
{36:8} So Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him. At the Lord’s temple he read the Lord’s words from the scroll.
{i36:9} Baruch Reads the Scroll
{36:9} In the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people of Jerusalem and all those coming in from Judah’s cities into Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the Lord.
{36:10} Then at the Lord’s temple, in the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper courtyard at the opening of the New Gate of the Lord’s temple, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read Jeremiah’s words from the scroll.
{36:11} When Micaiah son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the Lord from the scroll,
{36:12} he went down to the scribe’s chamber in the king’s palace. All the officials were sitting there — Elishama the scribe, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.
{36:13} Micaiah reported to them all the words he had heard when Baruch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people.
{36:14} Then all the officials sent word to Baruch through Jehudi son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, saying, “Bring the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll and went to them.
{36:15} They said to him, “Sit down and read it in our hearing.” So Baruch read it in their hearing.
{36:16} When they had heard all the words, they turned to each other in fear and said to Baruch, “We must surely tell the king all these things.”
{36:17} Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us — how did you write all these words? At his dictation?”
{36:18} Baruch said to them, “At his dictation. He recited all these words to me while I was writing on the scroll in ink.”
{i36:19} Jehoiakim Burns the Scroll
{36:19} The officials said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah must hide yourselves and tell no one where you are.”
{36:20} Then they came to the king at the courtyard, having deposited the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and reported everything in the hearing of the king.
{36:21} The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi then read it in the hearing of the king and all the officials who were standing by the king.
{36:22} Since it was the ninth month, the king was sitting in his winter quarters with a fire burning in front of him.
{36:23} As soon as Jehudi would read three or four columns, Jehoiakim would cut the scroll with a scribe’s knife and throw the columns into the blazing fire until the entire scroll was consumed by the fire in the brazier.
{36:24} As they heard all these words, the king and all of his servants did not become terrified or tear their garments.
{36:25} Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah had urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
{36:26} Then the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the Lord had hidden them.
{i36:27} Jeremiah Dictates Another Scroll
{36:27} After the king had burned the scroll with the words Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:
{36:28} “Take another scroll, and once again write on it the very words that were on the original scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah burned.
{36:29} You are to proclaim concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: This is what the Lord says: You have burned the scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written on it: The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land and cause it to be without man or beast?’
{36:30} Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on David’s throne, and his corpse will be thrown out to be exposed to the heat of day and the frost of night.
{36:31} I will punish him, his descendants, and his officers for their wrongdoing. I will bring on them, on the residents of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah all the disaster, which I warned them about but they did not listen.”
{36:32} Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch son of Neriah, the scribe, and he wrote on it at Jeremiah’s dictation all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim, Judah’s king, had burned in the fire. And many other words like them were added.
{i37:1} Jerusalem’s Last Days
{37:1} Zedekiah son of Josiah reigned as king in the land of Judah in place of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made him king.
{37:2} He and his officers and the people of the land did not obey the words of the Lord that He spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
{37:3} Nevertheless, King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, requesting, “Please pray to the Lord our God for us!”
{37:4} Jeremiah was going about his daily tasks among the people, for they had not yet put him into the prison.
{37:5} Pharaoh’s army had left Egypt, and when the Chaldeans, who were besieging Jerusalem, heard the report, they withdrew from Jerusalem.
{37:6} The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet:
{37:7} “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: This is what you will say to Judah’s king, who is sending you to inquire of Me: Watch: Pharaoh’s army, which has come out to help you, is going to return to its own land of Egypt.
{37:8} The Chaldeans will then return and fight against this city. They will capture it and burn it down.
{37:9} This is what the Lord says: Don’t deceive yourselves by saying, ‘The Chaldeans will leave us for good,’ for they will not leave.
{37:10} Indeed, if you were to strike down the entire Chaldean army that is fighting with you, and there remained among them only the badly wounded men, each in his tent, they would get up and burn this city down.”
{i37:11} Jeremiah’s Imprisonment
{37:11} When the Chaldean army withdrew from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army,
{37:12} Jeremiah started to leave Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to claim his portion there among the people.
{37:13} But when he was at the Benjamin Gate, an officer of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, and he apprehended Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans.”
{37:14} “That’s a lie,” Jeremiah replied. “I am not deserting to the Chaldeans!” Irijah would not listen to him but apprehended Jeremiah and took him to the officials.
{37:15} The officials were angry at Jeremiah and beat him and placed him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe, for it had been made into a prison.
{37:16} So Jeremiah went into a cell in the dungeon and stayed there many days.
{i37:17} Jeremiah Summoned by Zedekiah
{37:17} King Zedekiah later sent for him and received him, and in his house privately asked him, “Is there a word from the Lord?” “There is,” Jeremiah responded, and he continued, “You will be handed over to the king of Babylon.”
{37:18} Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you or your servants or these people that you have put me in prison?
{37:19} Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, claiming, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you and this land’?
{37:20} So now please listen, my lord the king. May my petition come before you. Don’t send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, or I will die there.”
{37:21} So King Zedekiah gave orders, and Jeremiah was placed in the guard’s courtyard. He was given a loaf of bread each day from the baker’s street until all the bread was gone from the city. So Jeremiah remained in the guard’s courtyard.
{i38:1} Jeremiah Thrown into a Cistern
{38:1} Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchijah heard the words Jeremiah was speaking to all the people:
{38:2} “This is what the Lord says: ‘Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine, and plague, but whoever surrenders to the Chaldeans will live. He will keep his life like the spoils of war and will live.’
{38:3} This is what the Lord says: ‘This city will most certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon’s army, and he will capture it.’”
{38:4} The officials then said to the king, “This man ought to die, because he is weakening the morale of the warriors who remain in this city and of all the people by speaking to them in this way. This man is not seeking the well-being of this people, but disaster.”
{38:5} King Zedekiah said, “Here he is; he’s in your hands since the king can’t do anything against you.”
{38:6} So they took Jeremiah and dropped him into the cistern of Malchiah the king’s son, which was in the guard’s courtyard, lowering Jeremiah with ropes. There was no water in the cistern, only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.
{38:7} But Ebed-melech, a Cushite court official employed in the king’s palace, heard Jeremiah had been put into the cistern. While the king was sitting at the Benjamin Gate,
{38:8} Ebed-melech went from the king’s palace and spoke to the king:
{38:9} “My lord the king, these men have been evil in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have dropped him into the cistern where he will die from hunger, because there is no more bread in the city.”
{38:10} So the king commanded Ebed-melech, the Cushite, “Take from here 30 men under your authority and pull Jeremiah the prophet up from the cistern before he dies.”
{38:11} So Ebed-melech took the men under his authority and went to the king’s palace to a place below the storehouse. From there he took old rags and worn-out clothes and lowered them by ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.
{38:12} Ebed-melech the Cushite cried out to Jeremiah, “Place these old rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes.” Jeremiah did so,
{38:13} and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern, but he continued to stay in the guard’s courtyard.
{i38:14} Zedekiah’s Final Meeting with Jeremiah
{38:14} King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the Lord’s temple. The king said to Jeremiah, “I am going to ask you something; don’t hide anything from me.”
{38:15} Jeremiah replied to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, you will kill me, won’t you? Besides, if I give you advice, you won’t listen to me anyway.”
{38:16} King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in private, “As the Lord lives, who has given us this life, I will not kill you or hand you over to these men who want to take your life.”
{38:17} Jeremiah therefore said to Zedekiah, “This is what the Lord, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘If indeed you surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then you will live, this city will not be burned down, and you and your household will survive.
{38:18} But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city will be handed over to the Chaldeans. They will burn it down, and you yourself will not escape from them.’”
{38:19} But King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am worried about the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans. They may hand me over to the Judeans to abuse me.”
{38:20} “They will not hand you over,” Jeremiah replied. “Obey the voice of the Lord in what I am telling you, so it may go well for you and you can live.
{38:21} But if you refuse to surrender, this is the verdict that the Lord has shown me:
{38:22} ‘All the women who remain in the palace of Judah’s king will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon and will say: Your trusted friends misled you and overcame you. Your feet sank into the mire, and they deserted you.
{38:23} All your wives and sons will be brought out to the Chaldeans. You yourself will not escape from them, for you will be seized by the king of Babylon and this city will burn down.’”
{38:24} Then Zedekiah warned Jeremiah, “Don’t let anyone know about these things or you will die.
{38:25} If the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come and demand of you, ‘Tell us what you said to the king; don’t hide anything from us and we won’t kill you. Also, what did the king say to you?’
{38:26} then you will tell them, ‘I was bringing before the king my petition that he not return me to the house of Jonathan to die there.’”
{38:27} When all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, he reported the exact words to them the king had commanded, and they quit speaking with him because nothing had been heard.
{38:28} Jeremiah remained in the guard’s courtyard until the day Jerusalem was captured, and he was there when it happened.
{i39:1} The Fall of Jerusalem to Babylon
{39:1} In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon advanced against Jerusalem with his entire army and laid siege to it.
{39:2} In the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year, on the ninth day of the month, the city was broken into.
{39:3} All the officials of the king of Babylon entered and sat at the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar, Nebusarsechim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer the Rab-mag, and all the rest of the officials of Babylon’s king.
{39:4} When he saw them, Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers fled. They left the city at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls. They left along the route to the Arabah.
{39:5} However, the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, arrested him, and brought him to Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon’s king, at Riblah in the land of Hamath. The king passed sentence on him there.
{39:6} At Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah’s sons before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all Judah’s nobles.
{39:7} Then he blinded Zedekiah and put him in bronze chains to take him to Babylon.
{39:8} The Chaldeans next burned down the king’s palace and the people’s houses and tore down the walls of Jerusalem.
{39:9} Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, deported the rest of the people to Babylon — those who had remained in the city and those deserters who had defected to him along with the rest of the people who had remained.
{39:10} However, Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and he gave them vineyards and fields at that time.
{i39:11} Jeremiah Freed by Nebuchadnezzar
{39:11} Speaking through Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon gave orders concerning Jeremiah, saying:
{39:12} “Take him, look after him, and don’t let any harm come to him; do for him whatever he says.”
{39:13} Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer the Rab-mag, and all the captains of the king of Babylon
{39:14} had Jeremiah brought from the guard’s courtyard and turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he settled among his own people.
{39:15} Now the word of the Lord had come to Jeremiah when he was confined in the guard’s courtyard:
{39:16} “Go tell Ebed-melech the Cushite: This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am about to fulfill My words for harm and not for good against this city. They will take place before your eyes on that day.
{39:17} But I will rescue you on that day” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “and you will not be handed over to the men you fear.
{39:18} Indeed, I will certainly deliver you so that you do not fall by the sword. Because you have trusted in Me, you will keep your life like the spoils of war.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{i40:1} Jeremiah Stays in Judah
{40:1} This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, released him at Ramah. When he found him, he was bound in chains with all the exiles of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon.
{40:2} The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “The Lord your God decreed this disaster on this place,
{40:3} and the Lord has fulfilled it. He has done just what He decreed. Because you people have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed Him, this thing has happened.
{40:4} Now pay attention: Today I am setting you free from the chains that were on your hands. If it pleases you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will take care of you. But if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, go no farther. Look — the whole land is in front of you. Wherever it seems good and right for you to go, go there.”
{40:5} When Jeremiah had not yet turned to go, Nebuzaradan said to him: “Return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people or go wherever you want to go.” So the captain of the guard gave him a ration and a gift and released him.
{40:6} Jeremiah therefore went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and he stayed with him among the people who remained in the land.
{i40:7} Gedaliah Advises Peace
{40:7} When all the commanders of the armies in the field — they and their men — heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over the land and that he had put him in charge of the men, women, and children from the poorest of the land who had not been deported to Babylon,
{40:8} they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. The commanders included Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite — they and their men.
{40:9} Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore an oath to them and their men, assuring them, “Don’t be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well for you.
{40:10} As for me, I am going to live in Mizpah to represent you before the Chaldeans who come to us. As for you, gather wine, summer fruit, and oil, place them in your storage jars, and live in the cities you have captured.”
{40:11} When all the Judeans in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and in all the other lands also heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, over them,
{40:12} they all returned from all the places where they had been banished and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and harvested a great amount of wine and summer fruit.
{40:13} Meanwhile, Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
{40:14} and warned him, “Don’t you realize that Baalis, king of the Ammonites, has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to kill you?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam would not believe them.
{40:15} Then Johanan son of Kareah suggested to Gedaliah in private at Mizpah, “Let me go kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah. No one will know it. Why should he kill you and scatter all of Judah that has gathered to you so that the remnant of Judah would perish?”
{40:16} But Gedaliah son of Ahikam responded to Johanan son of Kareah, “Don’t do that! What you’re saying about Ishmael is a lie.”
{i41:1} Gedaliah Assassinated by Ishmael
{41:1} In the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family and one of the king’s chief officers, came with 10 men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. They ate a meal together there in Mizpah,
{41:2} but then Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the 10 men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword; he killed the one the king of Babylon had appointed in the land.
{41:3} Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Chaldean soldiers who were there.
{41:4} On the second day after he had killed Gedaliah, when no one knew yet,
{41:5} 80 men came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria who had shaved their beards, torn their garments, and gashed themselves, and who were carrying grain and incense offerings to bring to the temple of the Lord.
{41:6} Ishmael son of Nethaniah came out of Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. When he encountered them, he said: “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam!”
{41:7} But when they came into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern.
{41:8} However, there were 10 men among them who said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us, for we have hidden treasure in the field — wheat, barley, oil, and honey!” So he stopped and did not kill them along with their companions.
{41:9} Now the cistern where Ishmael had thrown all the corpses of the men he had struck down was a large one that King Asa had made in the encounter with Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
{41:10} Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people of Mizpah including the daughters of the king — all those who remained in Mizpah over whom Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set off to cross over to the Ammonites.
{i41:11} The Captives Rescued by Johanan
{41:11} When Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done,
{41:12} they took all their men and went to fight with Ishmael son of Nethaniah and found him by the great pool in Gibeon.
{41:13} When all the people with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the army with him, they rejoiced,
{41:14} and all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and rejoined Johanan son of Kareah.
{41:15} But Ishmael son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the Ammonites.
{41:16} Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies with him then took from Mizpah all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after Ishmael had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam — men, soldiers, women, children, and court officials whom he brought back from Gibeon.
{41:17} They left, stopping in Geruth Chimham, which is near Bethlehem, in order to make their way into Egypt,
{41:18} away from the Chaldeans. For they feared them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed in the land.
{i42:1} The People Seek Jeremiah’s Counsel
{42:1} Then all the commanders of the armies, along with Johanan son of Kareah, Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, approached
{42:2} Jeremiah the prophet and said, “May our petition come before you; pray to the Lord your God on our behalf, on behalf of this entire remnant (for few of us remain out of the many, as you can see with your own eyes),
{42:3} that the Lord your God may tell us the way we should walk and the thing we should do.”
{42:4} So Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard. I will now pray to the Lord your God according to your words, and every word that the Lord answers you I will tell you; I won’t withhold a word from you.”
{42:5} And they said to Jeremiah, “As for every word the Lord your God sends you to tell us, if we don’t act accordingly, may the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us.
{42:6} Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God to whom we are sending you so that it may go well with us. We will certainly obey the voice of the Lord our God!”
{i42:7} Jeremiah’s Advice to Stay
{42:7} Now at the end of 10 days, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah,
{42:8} and he summoned Johanan son of Kareah, all the commanders of the armies who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest.
{42:9} He said to them, “This is what the Lord says, the God of Israel to whom you sent me to bring your petition before Him:
{42:10} ‘If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will rebuild and not demolish you, and I will plant and not uproot you, because I relent concerning the disaster that I have brought on you.
{42:11} Don’t be afraid of the king of Babylon whom you now fear; don’t be afraid of him’ — this is the Lord’s declaration — ‘because I am with you to save you and deliver you from him.
{42:12} I will grant you compassion, and he will have compassion on you and allow you to return to your own soil.
{42:13} But if you say, ‘We will not stay in this land,’ so as not to obey the voice of the Lord your God,
{42:14} and if you say, ‘No, instead we’ll go to the land of Egypt where we will not see war or hear the sound of the ram’s horn or hunger for food, and we’ll live there,’
{42:15} then hear the word of the Lord, remnant of Judah! This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: If you are firmly resolved to go to Egypt and live there for a while,
{42:16} then the sword you fear will overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine you are worried about will follow on your heels there to Egypt, and you will die there.
{42:17} All who resolve to go to Egypt to live there for a while will die by the sword, famine, and plague. They will have no one escape or survive from the disaster I will bring on them.’
{42:18} “For this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Just as My anger and fury were poured out on Jerusalem’s residents, so will My fury pour out on you if you go to Egypt. You will become an object of cursing, scorn, execration, and disgrace, and you will never see this place again.’
{42:19} The Lord has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah: ‘Don’t go to Egypt.’ Know for certain that I have warned you today!
{42:20} You have led your own selves astray because you are the ones who sent me to the Lord your God, saying, ‘Pray to the Lord our God on our behalf, and as for all that the Lord our God says, tell it to us, and we’ll act accordingly.’
{42:21} For I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God in everything He has sent me to tell you.
{42:22} Now therefore, know for certain that by the sword, famine, and plague you will die in the place where you desired to go to live for a while.”
{i43:1} Jeremiah’s Counsel Rejected
{43:1} When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of the Lord their God — all these words the Lord their God had sent him to give them —
{43:2} then Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and all the other arrogant men responded to Jeremiah, “You are speaking a lie! The Lord our God has not sent you to say, ‘You must not go to Egypt to live there for a while!’
{43:3} Rather, Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Chaldeans to put us to death or to deport us to Babylon!”
{43:4} So Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies did not obey the voice of the Lord to stay in the land of Judah.
{43:5} Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies took the whole remnant of Judah, those who had returned from all the nations where they had been banished to live in the land of Judah for a while —
{43:6} the men, women, children, king’s daughters, and everyone whom Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, had allowed to remain with Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, along with Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah —
{43:7} and they went to the land of Egypt because they did not obey the voice of the Lord. They went as far as Tahpanhes.
{i43:8} God’s Sign to the People in Egypt
{43:8} Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah at Tahpanhes:
{43:9} “Pick up some large stones and set them in the mortar of the brick pavement that is at the opening of Pharaoh’s palace at Tahpanhes. Do this in the sight of the Judean men
{43:10} and tell them: This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I will send for My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will place his throne on these stones that I have embedded, and he will pitch his pavilion over them.
{43:11} He will come and strike down the land of Egypt — those destined for death, to death; those destined for captivity, to captivity; and those destined for the sword, to the sword.
{43:12} I will kindle a fire in the temples of Egypt’s gods, and he will burn them and take them prisoner. He will clean the land of Egypt as a shepherd picks lice off his garment, and he will leave there unscathed.
{43:13} He will smash the sacred pillars of the sun temple in the land of Egypt and burn down the temples of the Egyptian gods.”
{i44:1} God’s Judgment against His People in Egypt
{44:1} This is the word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews living in the land of Egypt — at Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and in the land of Pathros:
{44:2} “This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: You have seen all the disaster I brought against Jerusalem and all Judah’s cities; look, they are a ruin today without an inhabitant in them
{44:3} because of their evil ways that provoked Me to anger, going and burning incense to serve other gods that they, you, and your fathers did not know.
{44:4} So I sent you all My servants the prophets time and time again, saying: Don’t do this detestable thing that I hate.
{44:5} But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their evil or stop burning incense to other gods.
{44:6} So My fierce wrath poured out and burned in Judah’s cities and Jerusalem’s streets so that they became the desolate ruin they are today.
{44:7} “So now, this is what the Lord, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Why are you doing such great harm to yourselves? You are cutting off man and woman, child and infant from Judah, leaving yourselves without a remnant.
{44:8} You are provoking Me to anger by the work of your hands. You are burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to live for a while. As a result, you will be cut off and become an object of cursing and insult among all the nations of earth.
{44:9} Have you forgotten the evils of your fathers, the evils of Judah’s kings, the evils of their wives, your own evils, and the evils of your wives that were committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
{44:10} They have not become humble to this day, and they have not feared or followed My instruction or My statutes that I set before you and your ancestors.
{44:11} “Therefore, this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am about to turn against you to bring disaster, to cut off all Judah.
{44:12} And I will take away the remnant of Judah, those who have resolved to go to the land of Egypt to live there for a while; they will meet their end. All of them in the land of Egypt will fall by the sword; they will meet their end by famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by the sword and by famine. Then they will become an object of cursing, scorn, execration, and disgrace.
{44:13} I will punish those living in the land of Egypt just as I punished Jerusalem by sword, famine, and plague.
{44:14} Then the remnant of Judah — those going to live for a while there in the land of Egypt — will have no fugitive or survivor to return to the land of Judah where they are longing to return to live, for they will not return except for a few fugitives.”
{i44:15} The People’s Stubborn Response
{44:15} However, all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, all the women standing by — a great assembly — and all the people who were living in the land of Egypt at Pathros answered Jeremiah,
{44:16} “As for the word you spoke to us in the name of Yahweh, we are not going to listen to you!
{44:17} Instead, we will do everything we said we would: burn incense to the queen of heaven and offer drink offerings to her just as we, our fathers, our kings, and our officials did in Judah’s cities and in Jerusalem’s streets. Then we had enough food and good things and saw no disaster,
{44:18} but from the time we ceased to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to offer her drink offerings, we have lacked everything, and through sword and famine we have met our end.”
{44:19} And the women said, “When we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, was it apart from our husbands’ knowledge that we made sacrificial cakes in her image and poured out drink offerings to her?”
{44:20} But Jeremiah responded to all the people — the men, women, and all the people who were answering him:
{44:21} “As for the incense you burned in Judah’s cities and in Jerusalem’s streets — you, your fathers, your kings, your officials, and the people of the land — did the Lord not remember them? He brought this to mind.
{44:22} The Lord can no longer bear your evil deeds and the detestable acts you have committed, so your land has become a waste, a desolation, and an object of cursing, without inhabitant, as you see today.
{44:23} Because you burned incense and sinned against the Lord and didn’t obey the Lord’s voice and didn’t follow His instruction, His statutes, and His testimonies, this disaster has come to you, as you see today.”
{44:24} Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear the word of the Lord, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt.
{44:25} This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘As for you and your wives, you women have spoken with your mouths, and you men fulfilled it by your deeds, saying, “We will keep our vows that we have made to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings for her.” Go ahead, confirm your vows! Pay your vows!’
{44:26} “Therefore, hear the word of the Lord, all you Judeans who live in the land of Egypt: ‘I have sworn by My great name, says Yahweh, that My name will never again be invoked by anyone of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, “As the Lord God lives.”
{44:27} I am watching over them for disaster and not for good, and every man of Judah who is in the land of Egypt will meet his end by sword or famine until they are finished off.
{44:28} Those who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah only few in number, and the whole remnant of Judah, the ones going to the land of Egypt to live there for a while, will know whose word stands, Mine or theirs!
{44:29} This will be a sign to you’ — this is the Lord’s declaration — ‘that I am about to punish you in this place, so you may know that My words of disaster concerning you will certainly come to pass.
{44:30} This is what the Lord says: I am about to hand over Pharaoh Hophra, Egypt’s king, to his enemies, to those who want to take his life, just as I handed over Judah’s King Zedekiah to Babylon’s King Nebuchadnezzar, who was his enemy, the one who wanted to take his life.’”
{i45:1} The Lord ’s Message to Baruch
{45:1} This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch son of Neriah when he wrote these words on a scroll at Jeremiah’s dictation in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:
{45:2} “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:
{45:3} ‘You have said, “Woe is me, because the Lord has added misery to my pain! I am worn out with groaning and have found no rest.”’
{45:4} “This is what you are to say to him: ‘This is what the Lord says: What I have built I am about to demolish, and what I have planted I am about to uproot — the whole land!
{45:5} But as for you, do you seek great things for yourself? Stop seeking! For I am about to bring disaster on every living creature’ — this is the Lord’s declaration — ‘but I will grant you your life like the spoils of war wherever you go.’”
{i46:1} Prophecies Against the Nations
{46:1} The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet about the nations:
{i46:2} Prophecies against Egypt
{46:2} About Egypt and the army of Pharaoh Neco, Egypt’s king, which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Judah’s King Jehoiakim son of Josiah:
{46:3} Deploy small shields and large; draw near for battle!
{46:4} Harness the horses; mount the steeds; take your positions with helmets on! Polish the lances; put on armor!
{46:5} Why have I seen this? They are terrified, they are retreating, their warriors are crushed, they flee headlong, they never look back, terror is on every side! This is the Lord’s declaration.
{46:6} The swift cannot flee, and the warrior cannot escape! In the north by the bank of the Euphrates River, they stumble and fall.
{46:7} Who is this, rising like the Nile, like rivers whose waters churn?
{46:8} Egypt rises like the Nile, and its waters churn like rivers. He boasts, “I will go up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy cities with their residents.”
{46:9} Rise up, you cavalry! Race furiously, you chariots! Let the warriors go out — Cush and Put, who are able to handle shields, and the Ludim, who are able to handle and string the bow.
{46:10} That day belongs to the Lord, the God of Hosts, a day of vengeance to avenge Himself against His adversaries. The sword will devour and be satisfied; it will drink its fill of their blood, because it will be a sacrifice to the Lord, the God of Hosts, in the northern land by the Euphrates River.
{46:11} Go up to Gilead and get balm, Virgin Daughter Egypt! You have multiplied remedies in vain; there is no healing for you.
{46:12} The nations have heard of your dishonor, and your outcry fills the earth, because warrior stumbles against warrior and together both of them have fallen.
{46:13} This is the word the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to defeat the land of Egypt:
{46:14} Announce it in Egypt, and proclaim it in Migdol! Proclaim it in Memphis and in Tahpanhes! Say: Take positions! Prepare yourself, for the sword devours all around you.
{46:15} Why have your strong ones been swept away? Each has not stood, for the Lord has thrust him down.
{46:16} He continues to stumble. Indeed, each falls over the other. They say, “Get up! Let’s return to our people and to the land of our birth, away from the sword that oppresses.”
{46:17} There they will cry out, “Pharaoh king of Egypt was all noise; he let the opportune moment pass.”
{46:18} As I live — this is the King’s declaration; Yahweh of Hosts is His name. He will come like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea.
{46:19} Get your bags ready for exile, inhabitant of Daughter Egypt! For Memphis will become a desolation, uninhabited ruins.
{46:20} Egypt is a beautiful young cow, but a horsefly from the north is coming against her.
{46:21} Even her mercenaries among her are like stall-fed calves. They too will turn back; together they will flee; they will not take their stand, for the day of their calamity is coming on them, the time of their punishment.
{46:22} Egypt will hiss like a slithering snake, for the enemy will come with an army; with axes they will come against her like those who cut trees.
{46:23} They will cut down her forest — this is the Lord’s declaration — though it is dense, for they are more numerous than locusts; they cannot be counted.
{46:24} Daughter Egypt will be put to shame, handed over to a northern people.
{46:25} The Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “I am about to punish Amon, god of Thebes, along with Pharaoh, Egypt, her gods, and her kings — Pharaoh and those trusting in him.
{46:26} I will hand them over to those who want to take their lives — to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. But after this, it will be inhabited again as in ancient times.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{i46:27} Reassurance for Israel
{46:27} But you, My servant Jacob, do not be afraid, and do not be discouraged, Israel, for without fail I will save you from far away and your descendants, from the land of their captivity! Jacob will return and have calm and quiet with no one to frighten him.
{46:28} And you, My servant Jacob, do not be afraid — this is the Lord’s declaration — for I will be with you. I will bring destruction on all the nations where I have banished you, but I will not bring destruction on you. I will discipline you with justice, and I will by no means leave you unpunished.
{i47:1} Prophecies against the Philistines
{47:1} This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet about the Philistines before Pharaoh defeated Gaza.
{47:2} This is what the Lord says: Look, waters are rising from the north and becoming an overflowing wadi. They will overflow the land and everything in it, the cities and their inhabitants. The people will cry out, and every inhabitant of the land will wail.
{47:3} At the sound of the stomping hooves of his stallions, the rumbling of his chariots, and the clatter of their wheels, fathers will not turn back for their sons, because they will be utterly helpless
{47:4} on account of the day that is coming to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every remaining ally. Indeed, the Lord is about to destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the islands of Caphtor.
{47:5} Baldness is coming to Gaza. Ashkelon will become silent, a remnant of their valley. How long will you gash yourself?
{47:6} Oh, sword of the Lord! How long will you be restless? Go back to your sheath; be still; be silent!
{47:7} How can it rest when the Lord has given it a command? He has assigned it against Ashkelon and the shore of the sea.
{i48:1} Prophecies against Moab
{48:1} About Moab, this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Woe to Nebo, because it is about to be destroyed; Kiriathaim will be put to shame; it will be taken captive. The fortress will be put to shame and dismayed!
{48:2} There is no longer praise for Moab; they plan harm against her in Heshbon: Come, let’s cut her off from nationhood. Also, Madmen, you will be silenced; the sword will pursue you.
{48:3} A voice cries out from Horonaim, “devastation and great disaster!”
{48:4} Moab will be shattered; her little ones will cry out.
{48:5} For on the Ascent to Luhith they will be weeping continually, and on the descent to Horonaim will be heard cries of distress over the destruction:
{48:6} Flee! Save your lives! Be like a juniper bush in the wilderness.
{48:7} Because you trust in your works and treasures, you will be captured also. Chemosh will go into exile with his priests and officials.
{48:8} The destroyer will move against every town; not one town will escape. The valley will perish, and the plain will be annihilated, as the Lord has said.
{48:9} Make Moab a salt marsh, for she will run away; her towns will become a desolation, without inhabitant.
{48:10} The one who does the Lord’s business deceitfully is cursed, and the one who withholds his sword from bloodshed is cursed.
{48:11} Moab has been left quiet since his youth, settled like wine on its dregs. He hasn’t been poured from one container to another or gone into exile. So his taste has remained the same, and his aroma hasn’t changed.
{48:12} Therefore look, the days are coming — this is the Lord’s declaration — when I will send those to him, who will pour him out. They will empty his containers and smash his jars.
{48:13} Moab will be put to shame because of Chemosh, just as the house of Israel was put to shame because of Bethel that they trusted in.
{48:14} How can you say, “We are warriors — mighty men ready for battle”?
{48:15} The destroyer of Moab and its towns has come up, and the best of its young men have gone down to slaughter. This is the King’s declaration; Yahweh of Hosts is His name.
{48:16} Moab’s calamity is near at hand; his disaster is rushing swiftly.
{48:17} Mourn for him, all you surrounding nations, everyone who knows his name. Say: How the mighty scepter is shattered, the glorious staff!
{48:18} Come down from glory; sit on parched ground, resident of the daughter of Dibon, for the destroyer of Moab has come against you; he has destroyed your fortresses.
{48:19} Stand by the highway and look, resident of Aroer! Ask him who is fleeing or her who is escaping: What happened?
{48:20} Moab is put to shame, indeed dismayed. Wail and cry out! Declare by the Arnon that Moab is destroyed.
{48:21} “Judgment has come to the land of the plateau — to Holon, Jahzah, Mephaath,
{48:22} Dibon, Nebo, Beth-diblathaim,
{48:23} Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, Beth-meon,
{48:24} Kerioth, Bozrah, and all the towns of the land of Moab, those far and near.
{48:25} Moab’s horn is chopped off; his arm is shattered.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{48:26} “Make him drunk, because he has exalted himself against the Lord. Moab will wallow in his own vomit, and he will also become a laughingstock.
{48:27} Wasn’t Israel a laughingstock to you? Was he ever found among thieves? For whenever you speak of him you shake your head.”
{48:28} Abandon the towns! Live in the cliffs, residents of Moab! Be like a dove that nests inside the mouth of a cave.
{48:29} We have heard of Moab’s pride, great pride, indeed — his insolence, arrogance, pride, and haughty heart.
{48:30} I know his outburst. This is the Lord’s declaration. It is empty. His boast is empty.
{48:31} Therefore, I will wail over Moab. I will cry out for Moab, all of it; he will moan for the men of Kir-heres.
{48:32} I will weep for you, vine of Sibmah, with more than the weeping for Jazer. Your tendrils have extended to the sea; they have reached to the sea and to Jazer. The destroyer has fallen on your summer fruit and grape harvest.
{48:33} Joy and celebration are taken from the fertile field and from the land of Moab. I have stopped the flow of wine from the winepresses; no one will tread with shouts of joy. The shouting is not a shout of joy.
{48:34} “There is a cry from Heshbon to Elealeh; they raise their voices as far as Jahaz — from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah — because even the waters of Nimrim have become desolate.
{48:35} In Moab, I will stop” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “the one who offers sacrifices on the high place and burns incense to his gods.
{48:36} Therefore, My heart moans like flutes for Moab, and My heart moans like flutes for the people of Kir-heres. And therefore, the wealth he has gained has perished.
{48:37} Indeed, every head is bald and every beard clipped; on every hand is a gash and sackcloth around the waist.
{48:38} On all the rooftops of Moab and in her public squares, everyone is mourning because I have shattered Moab like a jar no one wants.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{48:39} “How broken it is! They wail! How Moab has turned his back! He is ashamed. Moab will become a laughingstock and a shock to all those around him.”
{48:40} For this is what the Lord says: He will swoop down like an eagle and spread his wings against Moab.
{48:41} The towns have been captured, and the strongholds seized. In that day the heart of Moab’s warriors will be like the heart of a woman with contractions.
{48:42} Moab will be destroyed as a people because he has exalted himself against the Lord.
{48:43} Panic, pit, and trap await you, resident of Moab. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{48:44} He who flees from the panic will fall in the pit, and he who climbs from the pit will be captured in the trap, for I will bring against Moab the year of their punishment. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{48:45} Those who flee will stand exhausted in Heshbon’s shadow because fire has come out from Heshbon and a flame from within Sihon. It will devour Moab’s forehead and the skull of the noisemakers.
{48:46} Woe to you, Moab! The people of Chemosh have perished because your sons have been taken captive and your daughters have gone into captivity.
{48:47} Yet, I will restore the fortunes of Moab in the last days. This is the Lord’s declaration. The judgment on Moab ends here.
{i49:1} Prophecies against Ammon
{49:1} About the Ammonites, this is what the Lord says: Does Israel have no sons? Is he without an heir? Why then has Milcom dispossessed Gad and his people settled in their cities?
{49:2} Therefore look, the days are coming — this is the Lord’s declaration — when I will make the shout of battle heard against Rabbah of the Ammonites. It will become a desolate mound, and its villages will be burned down. Israel will dispossess their dispossessors, says the Lord.
{49:3} Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is devastated; cry out, daughters of Rabbah! Clothe yourselves with sackcloth, and lament; run back and forth within your walls, because Milcom will go into exile together with his priests and officials.
{49:4} Why do you brag about your valleys, your flowing valley, you faithless daughter? You who trust in your treasures and boast, “Who can attack me?”
{49:5} Look, I am about to bring terror on you — this is the declaration of the Lord God of Hosts — from all those around you. You will be banished, each man headlong, with no one to gather up the fugitives.
{49:6} But after that, I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{i49:7} Prophecies against Edom
{49:7} About Edom, this is what the Lord of Hosts says: Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom rotted away?
{49:8} Run! Turn back! Lie low, residents of Dedan, for I will bring Esau’s calamity on him at the time I punish him.
{49:9} If grape harvesters came to you, wouldn’t they leave some gleanings? Were thieves to come in the night, they would destroy only what they wanted.
{49:10} But I will strip Esau bare; I will uncover his secret places. He will try to hide himself, but he will be unable. His descendants will be destroyed along with his relatives and neighbors. He will exist no longer.
{49:11} Abandon your fatherless; I will preserve them; let your widows trust in Me.
{49:12} “For this is what the Lord says: If those who do not deserve to drink the cup must drink it, can you possibly remain unpunished? You will not remain unpunished, for you must drink it too.
{49:13} For by Myself I have sworn” — this is the Lord’s declaration — “Bozrah will become a desolation, a disgrace, a ruin, and a curse, and all her cities will become ruins forever.”
{49:14} I have heard a message from the Lord; a messenger has been sent among the nations: Assemble yourselves to come against her. Rise up for war!
{49:15} Look, I will certainly make you insignificant among the nations, despised among humanity.
{49:16} As to the terror you cause, your presumptuous heart has deceived you. You who live in the clefts of the rock, you who occupy the mountain summit, though you elevate your nest like the eagle, even from there I will bring you down. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{49:17} “Edom will become a desolation. Everyone who passes by her will be horrified and scoff because of all her wounds.
{49:18} As when Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown along with their neighbors,” says the Lord, “no one will live there; no human being will even stay in it as a temporary resident.
{49:19} “Look, it will be like a lion coming from the thickets of the Jordan to the watered grazing land. Indeed, I will chase Edom away from her land in a flash. I will appoint whoever is chosen for her. For who is like Me? Who will summon Me? Who is the shepherd who can stand against Me?”
{49:20} Therefore, hear the plans that the Lord has drawn up against Edom and the strategies He has devised against the people of Teman: The flock’s little lambs will certainly be dragged away, and their grazing land will be made desolate because of them.
{49:21} At the sound of their fall the earth will quake; the sound of her cry will be heard at the Red Sea.
{49:22} Look! It will be like an eagle soaring upward, then swooping down and spreading its wings over Bozrah. In that day the hearts of Edom’s warriors will be like the heart of a woman with contractions.
{i49:23} Prophecies against Damascus
{49:23} About Damascus: Hamath and Arpad are put to shame, for they have heard a bad report and are agitated; in the sea there is anxiety that cannot be calmed.
{49:24} Damascus has become weak; she has turned to run; panic has gripped her. Distress and labor pains have seized her like a woman in labor.
{49:25} How can the city of praise not be abandoned, the town that brings Me joy?
{49:26} Therefore, her young men will fall in her public squares; all the warriors will perish in that day. This is the declaration of the Lord of Hosts.
{49:27} I will set fire to the wall of Damascus; it will consume Ben-hadad’s citadels.
{i49:28} Prophecies against Kedar and Hazor
{49:28} About Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon’s king, defeated, this is what the Lord says: Rise up, go against Kedar, and destroy the people of the east!
{49:29} They will take their tents and their flocks along with their tent curtains and all their equipment. They will take their camels for themselves. They will call out to them: Terror is on every side!
{49:30} Run! Escape quickly! Lie low, residents of Hazor — this is the Lord’s declaration — for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has drawn up a plan against you; he has devised a strategy against you.
{49:31} Rise up, go up against a nation at ease, one living in security. This is the Lord’s declaration. They have no doors, not even a gate bar; they live alone.
{49:32} Their camels will become plunder, and their massive herds of cattle will become spoil. I will scatter them to the wind in every direction, those who shave their temples; I will bring calamity on them across all their borders. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{49:33} Hazor will become a jackals’ den, a desolation forever. No one will live there; no human being will even stay in it as a temporary resident.
{i49:34} Prophecies against Elam
{49:34} This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet about Elam at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah.
{49:35} This is what the Lord of Hosts says: I am about to shatter Elam’s bow, the source of their might.
{49:36} I will bring the four winds against Elam from the four corners of the heavens, and I will scatter them to all these winds. There will not be a nation to which Elam’s banished ones will not go.
{49:37} I will devastate Elam before their enemies, before those who want to take their lives. I will bring disaster on them, My burning anger. This is the Lord’s declaration. I will send the sword after them until I finish them off.
{49:38} I will set My throne in Elam, and I will destroy the king and officials from there. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{49:39} In the last days, I will restore the fortunes of Elam. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{i50:1} Prophecies against Babylon
{50:1} The word the Lord spoke about Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, through Jeremiah the prophet:
{50:2} Announce to the nations; proclaim and raise up a signal flag; proclaim, and hide nothing. Say: Babylon is captured; Bel is put to shame; Marduk is devastated; her idols are put to shame; her false gods, devastated.
{50:3} For a nation from the north will come against her; it will make her land desolate. No one will be living in it — both man and beast will escape.
{50:4} In those days and at that time — this is the Lord’s declaration — the Israelites and Judeans will come together, weeping as they come, and will seek the Lord their God.
{50:5} They will ask about Zion, turning their faces to this road. They will come and join themselves to the Lord in an everlasting covenant that will never be forgotten.
{50:6} My people are lost sheep; their shepherds have led them astray, guiding them the wrong way in the mountains. They have wandered from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting place.
{50:7} All who found them devoured them. Their adversaries said, “We’re not guilty; instead, they have sinned against the Lord, their righteous grazing land, the hope of their ancestors, the Lord.”
{50:8} Escape from Babylon; depart from the Chaldeans’ land. Be like the rams that lead the flock.
{50:9} For I will soon stir up and bring against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country. They will line up in battle formation against her; from there she will be captured. Their arrows will be like those of a skilled warrior who does not return empty-handed.
{50:10} The Chaldeans will become plunder; all Babylon’s plunderers will be fully satisfied. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{50:11} Because you rejoice, because you sing in triumph — you who plundered My inheritance — because you frolic like a young cow treading grain and neigh like stallions,
{50:12} your mother will be utterly humiliated; she who bore you will be put to shame. Look! She will lag behind all the nations — a dry land, a wilderness, an Arabah.
{50:13} Because of the Lord’s wrath, she will not be inhabited; she will become a desolation, every bit of her. Everyone who passes through Babylon will be horrified and scoff because of all her wounds.
{50:14} Line up in battle formation around Babylon, all you archers! Shoot at her! Do not spare an arrow, for she has sinned against the Lord.
{50:15} Raise a war cry against her on every side! She has thrown up her hands in surrender; her defense towers have fallen; her walls are demolished. Since this is the Lord’s vengeance, take out your vengeance on her; as she has done, do the same to her.
{50:16} Cut off the sower from Babylon as well as him who wields the sickle at harvest time. Because of the oppressor’s sword, each will turn to his own people, each will flee to his own land.
{i50:17} The Return of God’s People
{50:17} Israel is a stray lamb, chased by lions. The first who devoured him was the king of Assyria; the last one who crushed his bones was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
{50:18} Therefore, this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “I am about to punish the king of Babylon and his land just as I punished the king of Assyria.
{50:19} I will return Israel to his grazing land, and he will feed on Carmel and Bashan; he will be satisfied in the hill country of Ephraim and of Gilead.
{50:20} In those days and at that time — this is the Lord’s declaration — one will search for Israel’s guilt, but there will be none, and for Judah’s sins, but they will not be found, for I will forgive those I leave as a remnant.
{i50:21} The Invasion of Babylon
{50:21} “Go against the land of Merathaim, and against those living in Pekod. Put them to the sword; completely destroy them — this is the Lord’s declaration — do everything I have commanded you.
{50:22} The sound of war is in the land — a great destruction.
{50:23} How the hammer of the whole earth is cut down and smashed! What a horror Babylon has become among the nations!
{50:24} Babylon, I laid a trap for you, and you were caught, but you did not even know it. You were found and captured because you fought against the Lord.
{50:25} The Lord opened His armory and brought out His weapons of wrath, because it is a task of the Lord God of Hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
{50:26} Come against her from the most distant places. Open her granaries; pile her up like mounds of grain and completely destroy her. Leave her no survivors.
{50:27} Put all her young bulls to the sword; let them go down to the slaughter. Woe to them, because their day has come, the time of their punishment.
{i50:28} The Humiliation of Babylon
{50:28} “There is a voice of fugitives and those who escape from the land of Babylon announcing in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God, the vengeance for His temple.
{50:29} Summon the archers to Babylon, all who string the bow; camp all around her; let none escape. Repay her according to her deeds; just as she has done, do the same to her, for she has acted arrogantly against the Lord, against the Holy One of Israel.
{50:30} Therefore, her young men will fall in her public squares; all the warriors will perish in that day. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{50:31} Look, I am against you, you arrogant one — this is the declaration of the Lord God of Hosts — because your day has come, the time when I will punish you.
{50:32} The arrogant will stumble and fall with no one to pick him up. I will set fire to his cities, and it will consume everything around him.”
{i50:33} The Desolation of Babylon
{50:33} This is what the Lord of Hosts says: Israelites and Judeans alike have been oppressed. All their captors hold them fast; they refuse to release them.
{50:34} Their Redeemer is strong; Yahweh of Hosts is His name. He will fervently plead their case so that He might bring rest to the earth but turmoil to those who live in Babylon.
{50:35} A sword is over the Chaldeans — this is the Lord’s declaration — against those who live in Babylon, against her officials, and against her sages.
{50:36} A sword is against the diviners, and they will act foolishly. A sword is against her heroic warriors, and they will be terrified.
{50:37} A sword is against his horses and chariots and against all the foreigners among them, and they will be like women. A sword is against her treasuries, and they will be plundered.
{50:38} A drought will come on her waters, and they will be dried up. For it is a land of carved images, and they go mad because of terrifying things.
{50:39} Therefore, desert creatures will live with hyenas, and ostriches will also live in her. It will never again be inhabited or lived in through all generations.
{50:40} Just as God demolished Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns — this is the Lord’s declaration — so no one will live there; no human being will even stay in it as a temporary resident.
{i50:41} The Conquest of Babylon
{50:41} Look! A people comes from the north. A great nation and many kings will be stirred up from the remote regions of the earth.
{50:42} They grasp bow and javelin. They are cruel and show no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, lined up like men in battle formation against you, Daughter Babylon.
{50:43} The king of Babylon has heard reports about them, and his hands fall helpless. Distress has seized him — pain, like a woman in labor.
{50:44} “Look, it will be like a lion coming from the thickets of the Jordan to the watered grazing land. Indeed, I will chase Babylon away from her land in a flash. I will appoint whoever is chosen for her. For who is like Me? Who will summon Me? Who is the shepherd who can stand against Me?”
{50:45} Therefore, hear the plans that the Lord has drawn up against Babylon and the strategies He has devised against the land of the Chaldeans: Certainly the flock’s little lambs will be dragged away; certainly the grazing land will be made desolate because of them.
{50:46} At the sound of Babylon’s conquest the earth will quake; a cry will be heard among the nations.
{i51:1} God’s Judgment on Babylon
{51:1} This is what the Lord says: I am about to stir up a destructive wind against Babylon and against the population of Leb-qamai.
{51:2} I will send strangers to Babylon who will scatter her and strip her land bare, for they will come against her from every side in the day of disaster.
{51:3} Don’t let the archer string his bow; don’t let him put on his armor. Don’t spare her young men; completely destroy her entire army!
{51:4} Those who were slain will fall in the land of the Chaldeans, those who were pierced through, in her streets.
{51:5} For Israel and Judah are not left widowed by their God, the Lord of Hosts, though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.
{51:6} Leave Babylon; save your lives, each of you! Don’t perish because of her guilt. For this is the time of the Lord’s vengeance — He will pay her what she deserves.
{51:7} Babylon was a gold cup in the Lord’s hand, making the whole earth drunk. The nations drank her wine; therefore, the nations go mad.
{51:8} Suddenly Babylon fell and was shattered. Wail for her; get balm for her wound — perhaps she can be healed.
{51:9} We tried to heal Babylon, but she could not be healed. Abandon her! Let each of us go to his own land, for her judgment extends to the sky and reaches as far as the clouds.
{51:10} The Lord has brought about our vindication; come, let’s tell in Zion what the Lord our God has accomplished.
{51:11} Sharpen the arrows! Fill the quivers! The Lord has put it into the mind of the kings of the Medes because His plan is aimed at Babylon to destroy her, for it is the Lord’s vengeance, vengeance for His temple.
{51:12} Raise up a signal flag against the walls of Babylon; fortify the watch post; set the watchmen in place; prepare the ambush. For the Lord has both planned and accomplished what He has threatened against those who live in Babylon.
{51:13} You who reside by many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, your life thread is cut.
{51:14} The Lord of Hosts has sworn by Himself: I will fill you up with men as with locusts, and they will sing the victory song over you.
{51:15} He made the earth by His power, established the world by His wisdom, and spread out the heavens by His understanding.
{51:16} When He thunders, the waters in the heavens are in turmoil, and He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings the wind from His storehouses.
{51:17} Everyone is stupid and ignorant. Every goldsmith is put to shame by his carved image, for his cast images are a lie; there is no breath in them.
{51:18} They are worthless, a work to be mocked. At the time of their punishment they will be destroyed.
{51:19} Jacob’s Portion is not like these because He is the One who formed all things. Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; Yahweh of Hosts is His name.
{51:20} You are My battle club, My weapons of war. With you I will smash nations; with you I will bring kingdoms to ruin.
{51:21} With you I will smash the horse and its rider; with you I will smash the chariot and its rider.
{51:22} With you I will smash man and woman; with you I will smash the old man and the youth; with you I will smash the young man and the young woman.
{51:23} With you I will smash the shepherd and his flock; with you I will smash the farmer and his ox-team. With you I will smash governors and officials.
{51:24} “I will repay Babylon and all the residents of Chaldea for all their evil they have done in Zion before your very eyes.” This is the Lord’s declaration.
{51:25} Look, I am against you, devastating mountain — this is the Lord’s declaration — you devastate the whole earth. I will stretch out My hand against you, roll you down from the cliffs, and turn you into a charred mountain.
{51:26} No one will be able to retrieve a cornerstone or a foundation stone from you, because you will become desolate forever. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{51:27} Raise a signal flag in the land; blow a ram’s horn among the nations; set apart the nations against her. Summon kingdoms against her — Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. Appoint a marshal against her; bring up horses like a swarm of locusts.
{51:28} Set apart the nations for battle against her — the kings of Media, her governors and all her officials, and all the lands they rule.
{51:29} The earth quakes and trembles because the Lord’s intentions against Babylon stand: to make the land of Babylon an uninhabited desolation.
{51:30} Babylon’s warriors have stopped fighting; they sit in their strongholds. Their might is exhausted; they have become like women. Babylon’s homes have been set ablaze, her gate bars are shattered.
{51:31} Messenger races to meet messenger, and herald to meet herald, to announce to the king of Babylon that his city has been captured from end to end.
{51:32} The fords have been seized, the marshes set on fire, and the soldiers are terrified.
{51:33} For this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Daughter Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trampled. In just a little while her harvest time will come.
{51:34} “Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has devoured me; he has crushed me. He has set me aside like an empty dish; he has swallowed me like a sea monster; he filled his belly with my delicacies; he has vomited me out,”
{51:35} says the inhabitant of Zion; “Let the violence done to me and my family be done to Babylon. Let my blood be on the inhabitants of Chaldea,” says Jerusalem.
{51:36} Therefore, this is what the Lord says: I am about to plead your case and take vengeance on your behalf; I will dry up her sea and make her fountain run dry.
{51:37} Babylon will become a heap of rubble, a jackals’ den, a desolation and an object of scorn, without inhabitant.
{51:38} They will roar together like young lions; they will growl like lion cubs.
{51:39} While they are flushed with heat, I will serve them a feast, and I will make them drunk so that they revel. Then they will fall asleep forever and never wake up. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{51:40} I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams together with male goats.
{51:41} How Sheshach has been captured, the praise of the whole earth seized. What a horror Babylon has become among the nations!
{51:42} The sea has risen over Babylon; she is covered with its turbulent waves.
{51:43} Her cities have become a desolation, a dry and arid land, a land where no one lives, where no human being passes through.
{51:44} I will punish Bel in Babylon. I will make him vomit what he swallowed. The nations will no longer stream to him; even Babylon’s wall will fall.
{51:45} Come out from among her, My people! Save your lives, each of you, from the Lord’s burning anger.
{51:46} May you not become cowardly and fearful when the report is proclaimed in the land, for the report will come one year, and then another the next year. There will be violence in the land with ruler against ruler.
{51:47} Therefore, look, the days are coming when I will punish Babylon’s carved images. Her entire land will suffer shame, and all her slain will lie fallen within her.
{51:48} Heaven and earth and everything in them will shout for joy over Babylon because the destroyers from the north will come against her. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{51:49} Babylon must fall because of the slain of Israel, even as the slain of all the earth fell because of Babylon.
{51:50} You who have escaped the sword, go and do not stand still! Remember the Lord from far away, and let Jerusalem come to your mind.
{51:51} We are ashamed because we have heard insults. Humiliation covers our faces because foreigners have entered the holy places of the Lord’s temple.
{51:52} Therefore, look, the days are coming — this is the Lord’s declaration — when I will punish her carved images, and the wounded will groan throughout her land.
{51:53} Even if Babylon should ascend to the heavens and fortify her tall fortresses, destroyers will come against her from Me. This is the Lord’s declaration.
{51:54} The sound of a cry from Babylon! The sound of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
{51:55} For the Lord is going to devastate Babylon; He will silence her mighty voice. Their waves roar like abundant waters; the tumult of their voice resounds,
{51:56} for a destroyer is coming against her, against Babylon. Her warriors will be captured, their bows shattered, for the Lord is a God of retribution; He will certainly repay.
{51:57} I will make her princes and sages drunk, along with her governors, officials, and warriors. Then they will fall asleep forever and never wake up. This is the King’s declaration; Yahweh of Hosts is His name.
{51:58} This is what Yahweh of Hosts says: Babylon’s thick walls will be totally demolished, and her high gates consumed by fire. The peoples will have labored for nothing; the nations will exhaust themselves only to feed the fire.
{51:59} This is what Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, the quartermaster, when he went to Babylon with King Zedekiah of Judah in the fourth year of Zedekiah’s reign.
{51:60} Jeremiah wrote on one scroll about all the disaster that would come to Babylon; all these words were written against Babylon.
{51:61} Jeremiah told Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud.
{51:62} You must say, ‘Lord, You have threatened to cut off this place so that no one will live in it — man or beast. Indeed, it will remain desolate forever.’
{51:63} When you have finished reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates River.
{51:64} Then say, ‘In the same way, Babylon will sink and never rise again because of the disaster I am bringing on her. They will grow weary.’” The words of Jeremiah end here.
{i52:1} The Fall of Jerusalem
{52:1} Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king and reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
{52:2} Zedekiah did what was evil in the Lord’s sight just as Jehoiakim had done.
{52:3} Because of the Lord’s anger, it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that He finally banished them from His presence. Nevertheless, Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
{52:4} In the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon advanced against Jerusalem with his entire army. They laid siege to the city and built a siege wall all around it.
{52:5} The city was under siege until King Zedekiah’s eleventh year.
{52:6} By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that the people of the land had no food.
{52:7} Then the city was broken into, and all the warriors fled. They left the city by night by way of the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden, though the Chaldeans surrounded the city. They made their way along the route to the Arabah.
{52:8} The Chaldean army pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. Zedekiah’s entire army was scattered from him.
{52:9} The Chaldeans seized the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.
{52:10} At Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah’s sons before his eyes and also slaughtered the Judean commanders.
{52:11} Then he blinded Zedekiah and bound him with bronze chains. The king of Babylon brought Zedekiah to Babylon, where he kept him in custody until his dying day.
{52:12} On the tenth day of the fifth month — which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon — Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, entered Jerusalem as the representative of the king of Babylon.
{52:13} He burned the Lord’s temple, the king’s palace, all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the nobles.
{52:14} The whole Chaldean army with the commander of the guards tore down all the walls surrounding Jerusalem.
{52:15} Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, deported some of the poorest of the people, as well as the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen.
{52:16} But some of the poorest people of the land Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, left to be vinedressers and farmers.
{52:17} Now the Chaldeans broke into pieces the bronze pillars for the Lord’s temple and the water carts and the bronze reservoir that were in the Lord’s temple, and carried all the bronze to Babylon.
{52:18} They took the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, sprinkling basins, dishes, and all the bronze articles used in the temple service.
{52:19} The commander of the guards took away the bowls, firepans, sprinkling basins, pots, lampstands, pans, and drink offering bowls — whatever was gold or silver.
{52:20} As for the two pillars, the one reservoir, and the 12 bronze bulls under the water carts that King Solomon had made for the Lord’s temple, the weight of the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure.
{52:21} One pillar was 27 feet tall, had a circumference of 18 feet, was hollow — four fingers thick —
{52:22} and had a bronze capital on top of it. One capital, encircled by bronze latticework and pomegranates, stood 7 1/2 feet high. The second pillar was the same, with pomegranates.
{52:23} Each capital had 96 pomegranates all around it. All the pomegranates around the latticework numbered 100.
{52:24} The commander of the guards also took away Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest of the second rank, and the three doorkeepers.
{52:25} From the city he took a court official who had been appointed over the warriors; seven trusted royal aides found in the city; the secretary of the commander of the army, who enlisted the people of the land for military duty; and 60 men from the common people who were found within the city.
{52:26} Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
{52:27} The king of Babylon put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah went into exile from its land.
{52:28} These are the people Nebuchadnezzar deported: in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews;
{52:29} in his eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem;
{52:30} in Nebuchadnezzar’s twenty-third year, Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, deported 745 Jews. All together 4,600 people were deported.
{i52:31} Jehoiachin Pardoned
{52:31} On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Judah’s King Jehoiachin, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, pardoned King Jehoiachin of Judah and released him from prison.
{52:32} He spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
{52:33} So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and he dined regularly in the presence of the king of Babylon for the rest of his life.
{52:34} As for his allowance, a regular allowance was given to him by the king of Babylon, a portion for each day until the day of his death, for the rest of his life.
