{i1:1} Greeting
{1:1} Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will, for the promise of life in Christ Jesus:
{1:2} To Timothy, my dearly loved son. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
{i1:3} Thanksgiving
{1:3} I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience as my ancestors did, when I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day.
{1:4} Remembering your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy,
{1:5} clearly recalling your sincere faith that first lived in your grandmother Lois, then in your mother Eunice, and that I am convinced is in you also.
{1:6} Therefore, I remind you to keep ablaze the gift of God that is in you through the laying on of my hands.
{1:7} For God has not given us a spirit of fearfulness, but one of power, love, and sound judgment.
{i1:8} Not Ashamed of the Gospel
{1:8} So don’t be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, or of me His prisoner. Instead, share in suffering for the gospel, relying on the power of God.
{1:9} He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began.
{1:10} This has now been made evident through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who has abolished death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
{1:11} For this gospel I was appointed a herald, apostle, and teacher,
{1:12} and that is why I suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, because I know the One I have believed in and am persuaded that He is able to guard what has been entrusted to me until that day.
{i1:13} Be Loyal to the Faith
{1:13} Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
{1:14} Guard, through the Holy Spirit who lives in us, that good thing entrusted to you.
{1:15} This you know: All those in Asia have turned away from me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
{1:16} May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.
{1:17} On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he diligently searched for me and found me.
{1:18} May the Lord grant that he obtain mercy from Him on that day. And you know very well how much he ministered at Ephesus.
{i2:1} Be Strong in Grace
{2:1} You, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
{2:2} And what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, commit to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.
{2:3} Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
{2:4} No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in the concerns of civilian life; he seeks to please the recruiter.
{2:5} Also, if anyone competes as an athlete, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules.
{2:6} The hardworking farmer ought to be the first to get a share of the crops.
{2:7} Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.
{2:8} Keep your attention on Jesus Christ as risen from the dead and descended from David. This is according to my gospel.
{2:9} I suffer for it to the point of being bound like a criminal, but God’s message is not bound.
{2:10} This is why I endure all things for the elect: so that they also may obtain salvation, which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
{2:11} This saying is trustworthy: For if we have died with Him, we will also live with Him;
{2:12} if we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He will also deny us;
{2:13} if we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.
{i2:14} An Approved Worker
{2:14} Remind them of these things, charging them before God not to fight about words; this is in no way profitable and leads to the ruin of the hearers.
{2:15} Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who doesn’t need to be ashamed, correctly teaching the word of truth.
{2:16} But avoid irreverent, empty speech, for this will produce an even greater measure of godlessness.
{2:17} And their word will spread like gangrene; Hymenaeus and Philetus are among them.
{2:18} They have deviated from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and are overturning the faith of some.
{2:19} Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, having this inscription: The Lord knows those who are His, and Everyone who names the name of the Lord must turn away from unrighteousness.
{2:20} Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver bowls, but also those of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable.
{2:21} So if anyone purifies himself from anything dishonorable, he will be a special instrument, set apart, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.
{2:22} Flee from youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
{2:23} But reject foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they breed quarrels.
{2:24} The Lord’s slave must not quarrel, but must be gentle to everyone, able to teach, and patient,
{2:25} instructing his opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance leading them to the knowledge of the truth.
{2:26} Then they may come to their senses and escape the Devil’s trap, having been captured by him to do his will.
{i3:1} Difficult Times Ahead
{3:1} But know this: Difficult times will come in the last days.
{3:2} For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,
{3:3} unloving, irreconcilable, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, without love for what is good,
{3:4} traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
{3:5} holding to the form of godliness but denying its power. Avoid these people!
{3:6} For among them are those who worm their way into households and capture idle women burdened down with sins, led along by a variety of passions,
{3:7} always learning and never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.
{3:8} Just as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the truth, men who are corrupt in mind, worthless in regard to the faith.
{3:9} But they will not make further progress, for their lack of understanding will be clear to all, as theirs was also.
{i3:10} Struggles in the Christian Life
{3:10} But you have followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, and endurance,
{3:11} along with the persecutions and sufferings that came to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! Yet the Lord rescued me from them all.
{3:12} In fact, all those who want to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
{3:13} Evil people and impostors will become worse, deceiving and being deceived.
{3:14} But as for you, continue in what you have learned and firmly believed. You know those who taught you,
{3:15} and you know that from childhood you have known the sacred Scriptures, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
{3:16} All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness,
{3:17} so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
{i4:1} Fulfill Your Ministry
{4:1} I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge the living and the dead, and because of His appearing and His kingdom:
{4:2} Proclaim the message; persist in it whether convenient or not; rebuke, correct, and encourage with great patience and teaching.
{4:3} For the time will come when they will not tolerate sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, will multiply teachers for themselves because they have an itch to hear something new.
{4:4} They will turn away from hearing the truth and will turn aside to myths.
{4:5} But as for you, be serious about everything, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.
{4:6} For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time for my departure is close.
{4:7} I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
{4:8} There is reserved for me in the future the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me on that day, and not only to me, but to all those who have loved His appearing.
{i4:9} Final Instructions
{4:9} Make every effort to come to me soon,
{4:10} for Demas has deserted me, because he loved this present world, and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
{4:11} Only Luke is with me. Bring Mark with you, for he is useful to me in the ministry.
{4:12} I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
{4:13} When you come, bring the cloak I left in Troas with Carpus, as well as the scrolls, especially the parchments.
{4:14} Alexander the coppersmith did great harm to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works.
{4:15} Watch out for him yourself because he strongly opposed our words.
{4:16} At my first defense, no one stood by me, but everyone deserted me. May it not be counted against them.
{4:17} But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that the proclamation might be fully made through me and all the Gentiles might hear. So I was rescued from the lion’s mouth.
{4:18} The Lord will rescue me from every evil work and will bring me safely into His heavenly kingdom. To Him be the glory forever and ever! Amen.
{i4:19} Benediction
{4:19} Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
{4:20} Erastus has remained at Corinth; I left Trophimus sick at Miletus.
{4:21} Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.
{4:22} The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
