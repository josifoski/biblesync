{4:26} Mishma’s sons: his son Hammuel, his son Zaccur, and his son Shimei.
{4:27} Shimei had 16 sons and six daughters, but his brothers did not have many children, so their whole family did not become as numerous as the Judeans.
{4:28} They lived in Beer-sheba, Moladah, Hazar-shual,
{4:29} Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad,
{4:30} Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag,
{4:31} Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susim, Beth-biri, and Shaaraim. These were their cities until David became king.

{4:39} They went to the entrance of Gedor, to the east side of the valley to seek pasture for their flocks.
{4:40} They found rich, good pasture, and the land was broad, peaceful, and quiet, for some Hamites had lived there previously.
{4:41} These who were recorded by name came in the days of King Hezekiah of Judah, attacked the Hamites’ tents and the Meunites who were found there, and set them apart for destruction, as they are today. Then they settled in their place because there was pasture for their flocks.
{4:42} Now 500 men from these sons of Simeon went with Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi, as their leaders to Mount Seir.
{4:43} They struck down the remnant of the Amalekites who had escaped, and they still live there today.
{i5:1} Reuben’s Descendants
{5:1} These were the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel. He was the firstborn, but his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel, because Reuben defiled his father’s bed. He is not listed in the genealogy according to birthright.
{5:2} Although Judah became strong among his brothers and a ruler came from him, the birthright was given to Joseph.

{5:4} Joel’s sons: his son Shemaiah, his son Gog, his son Shimei,

{5:7} His relatives by their families as they are recorded in their genealogy: Jeiel the chief, Zechariah,
{5:8} and Bela son of Azaz, son of Shema, son of Joel. They settled in Aroer as far as Nebo and Baal-meon.
{5:9} They also settled in the east as far as the edge of the desert that extends to the Euphrates River, because their herds had increased in the land of Gilead.
{5:10} During Saul’s reign they waged war against the Hagrites, who were defeated by their power. And they lived in their tents throughout the region east of Gilead.
{i5:11} Gad’s Descendants
{5:11} The sons of Gad lived next to them in the land of Bashan as far as Salecah:
{5:12} Joel the chief, Shapham the second in command, Janai, and Shaphat in Bashan.

{5:14} These were the sons of Abihail son of Huri, son of Jaroah, son of Gilead, son of Michael, son of Jeshishai, son of Jahdo, son of Buz.
{5:15} Ahi son of Abdiel, son of Guni, was head of their ancestral houses.
{5:16} They lived in Gilead, in Bashan and its towns, and throughout the pasturelands of Sharon.
{5:17} All of them were registered in the genealogies during the reigns of Judah’s King Jotham and Israel’s King Jeroboam.
{5:18} The sons of Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh had 44,760 warriors who could serve in the army — men who carried shield and sword, drew the bow, and were trained for war.
{5:19} They waged war against the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab.
{5:20} They received help against these enemies because they cried out to God in battle, and the Hagrites and all their allies were handed over to them. He granted their request because they trusted in Him.
{5:21} They captured the Hagrites’ livestock — 50,000 of their camels, 250,000 sheep, and 2,000 donkeys — as well as 100,000 people.
{5:22} Many of the Hagrites were killed because it was God’s battle. And they lived there in the Hagrites’ place until the exile.
{i5:23} Half the Tribe of Manasseh
{5:23} The sons of half the tribe of Manasseh settled in the land from Bashan to Baal-hermon (that is, Senir or Mount Hermon); they were numerous.
{5:24} These were the heads of their ancestral houses: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel. They were brave warriors, famous men, and heads of their ancestral houses.
{5:25} But they were unfaithful to the God of their ancestors. They prostituted themselves with the gods of the nations God had destroyed before them.
{5:26} So the God of Israel put it into the mind of Pul (that is, Tiglath-pileser ) king of Assyria to take the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh into exile. He took them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and Gozan’s river, where they are until today.

{6:32} They ministered with song in front of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, until Solomon built the Lord’s temple in Jerusalem, and they performed their task according to the regulations given to them.

{i9:1} After the Exile
{9:1} All Israel was registered in the genealogies that are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel. But Judah was exiled to Babylon because of their unfaithfulness.
{9:2} The first to live in their towns on their own property again were Israelites, priests, Levites, and temple servants.
{9:3} These people from the descendants of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh settled in Jerusalem:
{9:4} Uthai son of Ammihud, son of Omri, son of Imri, son of Bani, a descendant of Perez son of Judah;
{9:5} from the Shilonites: Asaiah the firstborn and his sons;
{9:6} and from the sons of Zerah: Jeuel and 690 of their relatives.

{9:17} The gatekeepers: Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their relatives. Shallum was their chief;
{9:18} he was previously stationed at the King’s Gate on the east side. These were the gatekeepers from the camp of the Levites.
{9:19} Shallum son of Kore, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah and his relatives from his ancestral household, the Korahites, were assigned to guard the thresholds of the tent. Their ancestors had been assigned to the Lord’s camp as guardians of the entrance.
{9:20} In earlier times Phinehas son of Eleazar had been their leader, and the Lord was with him.
{9:21} Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was the gatekeeper at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
{9:22} The total number of those chosen to be gatekeepers at the thresholds was 212. They were registered by genealogy in their villages. David and Samuel the seer had appointed them to their trusted positions.
{9:23} So they and their sons were assigned to the gates of the Lord’s temple, which had been the tent-temple.
{9:24} The gatekeepers were on the four sides: east, west, north, and south.
{9:25} Their relatives came from their villages at fixed times to be with them seven days,
{9:26} but the four chief gatekeepers, who were Levites, were entrusted with the rooms and the treasuries of God’s temple.
{9:27} They spent the night in the vicinity of God’s temple, because they had guard duty and were in charge of opening it every morning.
{9:28} Some of them were in charge of the utensils used in worship. They would count them when they brought them in and when they took them out.
{9:29} Others were put in charge of the furnishings and all the utensils of the sanctuary, as well as the fine flour, wine, oil, incense, and spices.
{9:30} Some of the priests’ sons mixed the spices.
{9:31} A Levite called Mattithiah, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was entrusted with baking the bread.

{9:33} The singers, the heads of the Levite families, stayed in the temple chambers and were exempt from other tasks because they were on duty day and night.
{9:34} These were the heads of the Levite families, chiefs according to their genealogies, and lived in Jerusalem.

{i10:1} The Deaths of Saul and His Sons
{10:1} The Philistines fought against Israel, and Israel’s men fled from them and were killed on Mount Gilboa.
{10:2} The Philistines pursued Saul and his sons and killed Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua.
{10:3} When the battle intensified against Saul, the archers found him and severely wounded him.
{10:4} Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through with it, or these uncircumcised men will come and torture me!” But his armor-bearer wouldn’t do it because he was terrified. Then Saul took his sword and fell on it.
{10:5} When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his own sword and died.
{10:6} So Saul and his three sons died — his whole house died together.
{10:7} When all the men of Israel in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled. So the Philistines came and settled in them.
{10:8} The next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons dead on Mount Gilboa.
{10:9} They stripped Saul, cut off his head, took his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to spread the good news to their idols and their people.
{10:10} Then they put his armor in the temple of their gods and hung his skull in the temple of Dagon.
{10:11} When all Jabesh-gilead heard of everything the Philistines had done to Saul,
{10:12} all their brave men set out and retrieved the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to Jabesh. They buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days.
{10:13} Saul died for his unfaithfulness to the Lord because he did not keep the Lord’s word. He even consulted a medium for guidance,
{10:14} but he did not inquire of the Lord. So the Lord put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.
{i11:1} David’s Anointing as King
{11:1} All Israel came together to David at Hebron and said, “Here we are, your own flesh and blood.
{11:2} Even when Saul was king, you led us out to battle and brought us back. The Lord your God also said to you, ‘You will shepherd My people Israel and be ruler over My people Israel.’”
{11:3} So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron. David made a covenant with them at Hebron in the Lord’s presence, and they anointed David king over Israel, in keeping with the Lord’s word through Samuel.
{i11:4} David’s Capture of Jerusalem
{11:4} David and all Israel marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus ); the Jebusites who inhabited the land were there.
{11:5} The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will never get in here.” Yet David did capture the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
{11:6} David said, “Whoever is the first to kill a Jebusite will become chief commander.” Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became the chief.
{11:7} Then David took up residence in the stronghold; therefore, it was called the city of David.
{11:8} He built up the city all the way around, from the supporting terraces to the surrounding parts, and Joab restored the rest of the city.
{11:9} David steadily grew more powerful, and the Lord of Hosts was with him.
{i11:10} Exploits of David’s Warriors
{11:10} The following were the chiefs of David’s warriors who, together with all Israel, strongly supported him in his reign to make him king according to the Lord’s word about Israel.
{11:11} This is the list of David’s warriors: Jashobeam son of Hachmoni was chief of the Thirty; he wielded his spear against 300 and killed them at one time.
{11:12} After him, Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite was one of the three warriors.
{11:13} He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines had gathered there for battle. There was a portion of a field full of barley, where the troops had fled from the Philistines.
{11:14} But Eleazar and David took their stand in the middle of the field and defended it. They killed the Philistines, and the Lord gave them a great victory.
{11:15} Three of the 30 chief men went down to David, to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while the Philistine army was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
{11:16} At that time David was in the stronghold, and a Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
{11:17} David was extremely thirsty and said, “If only someone would bring me water to drink from the well at the city gate of Bethlehem!”
{11:18} So the Three broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the well at the gate of Bethlehem. They brought it back to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out to the Lord.
{11:19} David said, “I would never do such a thing in the presence of God! How can I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?” For they brought it at the risk of their lives. So he would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three warriors.
{11:20} Abishai, Joab’s brother, was the leader of the Three. He raised his spear against 300 men and killed them, gaining a reputation among the Three.
{11:21} He was more honored than the Three and became their commander even though he did not become one of the Three.
{11:22} Benaiah son of Jehoiada was the son of a brave man from Kabzeel, a man of many exploits. Benaiah killed two sons of Ariel of Moab, and he went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
{11:23} He also killed an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet tall. Even though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand like a weaver’s beam, Benaiah went down to him with a club, snatched the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and then killed him with his own spear.
{11:24} These were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who had a reputation among the three warriors.
{11:25} He was the most honored of the Thirty, but he did not become one of the Three. David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
{11:26} The fighting men were: Joab’s brother Asahel, Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
{11:27} Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
{11:28} Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,

{11:33} Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
{11:34} the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite,
{11:35} Ahiam son of Sachar the Hararite, Eliphal son of Ur,
{11:36} Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
{11:37} Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai son of Ezbai,
{11:38} Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar son of Hagri,
{11:39} Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer for Joab son of Zeruiah,
{11:40} Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
{11:41} Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai,
{11:42} Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, chief of the Reubenites, and 30 with him,
{11:43} Hanan son of Maacah, Joshaphat the Mithnite,
{11:44} Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
{11:45} Jediael son of Shimri and his brother Joha the Tizite,
{11:46} Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite,
{11:47} Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
{i12:1} David’s First Supporters
{12:1} The following were the men who came to David at Ziklag while he was still banned from the presence of Saul son of Kish. They were among the warriors who helped him in battle.
{12:2} They were archers who could use either the right or left hand, both to sling stones and shoot arrows from a bow. They were Saul’s relatives from Benjamin:
{12:3} Their chief was Ahiezer son of Shemaah the Gibeathite. Then there was his brother Joash; Jeziel and Pelet sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, Jehu the Anathothite;
{12:4} Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a warrior among the Thirty and a leader over the Thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite;
{12:5} Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite;
{12:6} Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites;
{12:7} and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
{12:8} Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the desert. They were fighting men, trained for battle, expert with shield and spear. Their faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as gazelles on the mountains.
{12:9} Ezer was the chief, Obadiah second, Eliab third,
{12:10} Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth,
{12:11} Attai sixth, Eliel seventh,
{12:12} Johanan eighth, Elzabad ninth,
{12:13} Jeremiah tenth, and Machbannai eleventh.
{12:14} These Gadites were army commanders; the least of them was a match for a hundred, and the greatest of them for a thousand.
{12:15} These are the men who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and put to flight all those in the valleys to the east and to the west.
{12:16} Other Benjaminites and men from Judah also went to David at the stronghold.
{12:17} David went out to meet them and said to them, “If you have come in peace to help me, my heart will be united with you, but if you have come to betray me to my enemies even though my hands have done no wrong, may the God of our ancestors look on it and judge.”
{12:18} Then the Spirit took control of Amasai, chief of the Thirty, and he said: We are yours, David, we are with you, son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to him who helps you, for your God helps you. So David received them and made them leaders of his troops.
{12:19} Some Manassites defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. However, they did not help the Philistines because the Philistine rulers sent David away after a discussion. They said, “It will be our heads if he defects to his master Saul.”
{12:20} When David went to Ziklag, some men from Manasseh defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh.
{12:21} They helped David against the raiders, for they were all brave warriors and commanders in the army.
{12:22} At that time, men came day after day to help David until there was a great army, like an army of God.
{i12:23} David’s Soldiers in Hebron
{12:23} The numbers of the armed troops who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul’s kingdom over to him, according to the Lord’s word, were as follows:
{12:24} From the Judahites: 6,800 armed troops bearing shields and spears.
{12:25} From the Simeonites: 7,100 brave warriors ready for war.
{12:26} From the Levites: 4,600
{12:27} in addition to Jehoiada, leader of the house of Aaron, with 3,700 men;
{12:28} and Zadok, a young brave warrior, with 22 commanders from his own ancestral house.
{12:29} From the Benjaminites, the relatives of Saul: 3,000 (up to that time the majority of the Benjaminites maintained their allegiance to the house of Saul).
{12:30} From the Ephraimites: 20,800 brave warriors who were famous men in their ancestral houses.
{12:31} From half the tribe of Manasseh: 18,000 designated by name to come and make David king.
{12:32} From the Issacharites, who understood the times and knew what Israel should do: 200 chiefs with all their relatives under their command.
{12:33} From Zebulun: 50,000 who could serve in the army, trained for battle with all kinds of weapons of war, with one purpose to help David.
{12:34} From Naphtali: 1,000 commanders accompanied by 37,000 men with shield and spear.
{12:35} From the Danites: 28,600 trained for battle.
{12:36} From Asher: 40,000 who could serve in the army, trained for battle.
{12:37} From across the Jordan — from the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh: 120,000 men equipped with all the military weapons of war.
{12:38} All these warriors, lined up in battle formation, came to Hebron fully determined to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of Israel was also of one mind to make David king.
{12:39} They spent three days there eating and drinking with David, for their relatives had provided for them.
{12:40} In addition, their neighbors from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali came and brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen — abundant provisions of flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine and oil, oxen, and sheep. Indeed, there was joy in Israel.
{i13:1} David and the Ark
{13:1} David consulted with all his leaders, the commanders of hundreds and of thousands.
{13:2} Then he said to the whole assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if this is from the Lord our God, let us spread out and send the message to the rest of our relatives in all the districts of Israel, including the priests and Levites in their cities with pasturelands, that they should gather together with us.
{13:3} Then let us bring back the ark of our God, for we did not inquire of Him in Saul’s days.”
{13:4} Since the proposal seemed right to all the people, the whole assembly agreed to do it.
{13:5} So David assembled all Israel, from the Shihor of Egypt to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
{13:6} David and all Israel went to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim that belongs to Judah) to take the ark of God from there, which is called by the name of the Lord who dwells between the cherubim.
{13:7} At Abinadab’s house they set the ark of God on a new cart. Uzzah and Ahio were guiding the cart.
{13:8} David and all Israel were celebrating with all their might before God with songs and with lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
{13:9} When they came to Chidon’s threshing floor, Uzzah reached out to hold the ark because the oxen had stumbled.
{13:10} Then the Lord’s anger burned against Uzzah, and He struck him dead because he had reached out to the ark. So he died there in the presence of God.
{13:11} David was angry because of the Lord’s outburst against Uzzah, so he named that place Outburst Against Uzzah, as it is still named today.
{13:12} David feared God that day and said, “How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?”
{13:13} So David did not move the ark of God home to the city of David; instead, he took it to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
{13:14} The ark of God remained with Obed-edom’s family in his house for three months, and the Lord blessed his family and all that he had.
{i14:1} God’s Blessing on David
{14:1} King Hiram of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs, stonemasons, and carpenters to build a palace for him.
{14:2} Then David knew that the Lord had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom had been exalted for the sake of His people Israel.
{14:3} David took more wives in Jerusalem, and he became the father of more sons and daughters.
{14:4} These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
{14:5} Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
{14:6} Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
{14:7} Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
{14:8} When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they all went in search of David; when David heard of this, he went out to face them.
{14:9} Now the Philistines had come and raided in the Valley of Rephaim,
{14:10} so David inquired of God, “Should I go to war against the Philistines? Will You hand them over to me?” The Lord replied, “Go, and I will hand them over to you.”
{14:11} So the Israelites went up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated the Philistines there. Then David said, “Like a bursting flood, God has used me to burst out against my enemies.” Therefore, they named that place the Lord Bursts Out.
{14:12} The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David ordered that they be burned in the fire.
{14:13} Once again the Philistines raided in the valley.
{14:14} So David again inquired of God, and God answered him, “Do not pursue them directly. Circle around them and attack them opposite the balsam trees.
{14:15} When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then march out to battle, for God will have marched out ahead of you to attack the camp of the Philistines.”
{14:16} So David did exactly as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer.
{14:17} Then David’s fame spread throughout the lands, and the Lord caused all the nations to be terrified of him.
{i15:1} The Ark Comes to Jerusalem
{15:1} David built houses for himself in the city of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
{15:2} Then David said, “No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because the Lord has chosen them to carry the ark of the Lord and to minister before Him forever.”
{15:3} David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring the ark of the Lord to the place he had prepared for it.
{15:4} Then he gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:
{15:5} From the Kohathites, Uriel the leader and 120 of his relatives;
{15:6} from the Merarites, Asaiah the leader and 220 of his relatives;
{15:7} from the Gershomites, Joel the leader and 130 of his relatives;
{15:8} from the Elizaphanites, Shemaiah the leader and 200 of his relatives;
{15:9} from the Hebronites, Eliel the leader and 80 of his relatives;
{15:10} from the Uzzielites, Amminadab the leader and 112 of his relatives.
{15:11} David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.
{15:12} He said to them, “You are the heads of the Levite families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves so that you may bring the ark of the Lord God of Israel to the place I have prepared for it.
{15:13} For the Lord our God burst out in anger against us because you Levites were not with us the first time, for we didn’t inquire of Him about the proper procedures.”
{15:14} So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel.
{15:15} Then the Levites carried the ark of God the way Moses had commanded according to the word of the Lord: on their shoulders with the poles.
{15:16} Then David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their relatives as singers and to have them raise their voices with joy accompanied by musical instruments — harps, lyres, and cymbals.
{15:17} So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his relatives, Asaph son of Berechiah; and from their relatives the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah.
{15:18} With them were their relatives second in rank: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel.
{15:19} The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals;
{15:20} Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth;
{15:21} and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead the music with lyres according to the Sheminith.
{15:22} Chenaniah, the leader of the Levites in music, was to direct the music because he was skillful.
{15:23} Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the ark.
{15:24} The priests, Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, were to blow trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were also to be gatekeepers for the ark.
{15:25} David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders of thousands went with rejoicing to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the house of Obed-edom.
{15:26} While the Levites were carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord, with God’s help, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
{15:27} Now David was dressed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, as well as the singers and Chenaniah, the music leader of the singers. David also wore a linen ephod.
{15:28} So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouts, the sound of the ram’s horn, trumpets, and cymbals, and the playing of harps and lyres.
{15:29} As the ark of the covenant of the Lord was entering the city of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked down from the window and saw King David dancing and celebrating, and she despised him in her heart.
{16:1} They brought the ark of God and placed it inside the tent David had pitched for it. Then they offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in God’s presence.
{16:2} When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh.
{16:3} Then he distributed to each and every Israelite, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake.
{16:4} David appointed some of the Levites to be ministers before the ark of the Lord, to celebrate the Lord God of Israel, and to give thanks and praise to Him.
{16:5} Asaph was the chief and Zechariah was second to him. Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel played the harps and lyres, while Asaph sounded the cymbals
{16:6} and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel blew the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.
{i16:7} David’s Psalm of Thanksgiving
{16:7} On that day David decreed for the first time that thanks be given to the Lord by Asaph and his relatives:
{16:8} Give thanks to Yahweh; call on His name; proclaim His deeds among the peoples.
{16:9} Sing to Him; sing praise to Him; tell about all His wonderful works!
{16:10} Honor His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.
{16:11} Search for the Lord and for His strength; seek His face always.
{16:12} Remember the wonderful works He has done, His wonders, and the judgments He has pronounced,
{16:13} you offspring of Israel His servant, Jacob’s descendants — His chosen ones.
{16:14} He is the Lord our God; His judgments govern the whole earth.
{16:15} Remember His covenant forever — the promise He ordained for a thousand generations,
{16:16} the covenant He made with Abraham, swore to Isaac,
{16:17} and confirmed to Jacob as a decree, and to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
{16:18} “I will give the land of Canaan to you as your inherited portion.”
{16:19} When they were few in number, very few indeed, and temporary residents in Canaan
{16:20} wandering from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another,
{16:21} He allowed no one to oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf:
{16:22} “Do not touch My anointed ones or harm My prophets.”
{16:23} Sing to the Lord, all the earth. Proclaim His salvation from day to day.
{16:24} Declare His glory among the nations, His wonderful works among all peoples.
{16:25} For the Lord is great and highly praised; He is feared above all gods.
{16:26} For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.
{16:27} Splendor and majesty are before Him; strength and joy are in His place.
{16:28} Ascribe to the Lord, families of the peoples, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
{16:29} Ascribe to Yahweh the glory of His name; bring an offering and come before Him. Worship the Lord in the splendor of His holiness;
{16:30} tremble before Him, all the earth. The world is firmly established; it cannot be shaken.
{16:31} Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice, and let them say among the nations, “The Lord is King!”
{16:32} Let the sea and everything in it resound; let the fields and all that is in them exult.
{16:33} Then the trees of the forest will shout for joy before the Lord, for He is coming to judge the earth.
{16:34} Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His faithful love endures forever.
{16:35} And say: “Save us, God of our salvation; gather us and rescue us from the nations so that we may give thanks to Your holy name and rejoice in Your praise.
{16:36} May Yahweh, the God of Israel, be praised from everlasting to everlasting.” Then all the people said, “Amen” and “Praise the Lord.”
{16:37} So David left Asaph and his relatives there before the ark of the Lord’s covenant to minister regularly before the ark according to the daily requirements.
{16:38} He assigned Obed-edom and his 68 relatives. Obed-edom son of Jeduthun and Hosah were to be gatekeepers.
{16:39} David left Zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the Lord at the high place in Gibeon
{16:40} to offer burnt offerings regularly, morning and evening, to the Lord on the altar of burnt offerings and to do everything that was written in the law of the Lord, which He had commanded Israel to keep.
{16:41} With them were Heman, Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the Lord — for His faithful love endures forever.
{16:42} Heman and Jeduthun had with them trumpets and cymbals to play and musical instruments of God. Jeduthun’s sons were at the gate.
{16:43} Then all the people left for their homes, and David returned home to bless his household.
{i17:1} The Lord ’s Covenant with David
{17:1} When David had settled into his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Look! I am living in a cedar house while the ark of the Lord’s covenant is under tent curtains.”
{17:2} So Nathan told David, “Do all that is on your heart, for God is with you.”
{17:3} But that night the word of God came to Nathan:
{17:4} “Go to David My servant and say, ‘This is what the Lord says: You are not the one to build Me a house to dwell in.
{17:5} From the time I brought Israel out of Egypt until today I have not lived in a house; instead, I have moved from tent to tent and from tabernacle to tabernacle.
{17:6} In all My travels throughout Israel, have I ever spoken a word to even one of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, asking: Why haven’t you built Me a house of cedar?’
{17:7} “Now this is what you will say to My servant David: ‘This is what the Lord of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture and from following the sheep to be ruler over My people Israel.
{17:8} I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have destroyed all your enemies before you. I will make a name for you like that of the greatest in the land.
{17:9} I will establish a place for My people Israel and plant them, so that they may live there and not be disturbed again. Evildoers will not continue to oppress them as they formerly have
{17:10} ever since the day I ordered judges to be over My people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies. “‘Furthermore, I declare to you that the Lord Himself will build a house for you.
{17:11} When your time comes to be with your fathers, I will raise up after you your descendant, who is one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
{17:12} He will build a house for Me, and I will establish his throne forever.
{17:13} I will be a father to him, and he will be a son to Me. I will not take away My faithful love from him as I took it from the one who was before you.
{17:14} I will appoint him over My house and My kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.’”
{17:15} Nathan reported all these words and this entire vision to David.
{i17:16} David’s Prayer of Thanksgiving
{17:16} Then King David went in, sat in the Lord’s presence, and said, Who am I, Lord God, and what is my house that You have brought me this far?
{17:17} This was a little thing to You, God, for You have spoken about Your servant’s house in the distant future. You regard me as a man of distinction, Lord God.
{17:18} What more can David say to You for honoring Your servant? You know Your servant.
{17:19} Lord, You have done all this greatness, making known all these great promises because of Your servant and according to Your will.
{17:20} Lord, there is no one like You, and there is no God besides You, as all we have heard confirms.
{17:21} And who is like Your people Israel? God, You came to one nation on earth to redeem a people for Yourself, to make a name for Yourself through great and awesome works by driving out nations before Your people You redeemed from Egypt.
{17:22} You made Your people Israel Your own people forever, and You, Lord, have become their God.
{17:23} Now, Lord, let the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house be confirmed forever, and do as You have promised.
{17:24} Let Your name be confirmed and magnified forever in the saying, “Yahweh of Hosts, the God of Israel, is God over Israel.” May the house of Your servant David be established before You.
{17:25} Since You, my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build him a house, Your servant has found courage to pray in Your presence.
{17:26} Yahweh, You indeed are God, and You have promised this good thing to Your servant.
{17:27} So now, You have been pleased to bless Your servant’s house that it may continue before You forever. For You, Lord, have blessed it, and it is blessed forever.
{i18:1} David’s Military Campaigns
{18:1} After this, David defeated the Philistines, subdued them, and took Gath and its villages from Philistine control.
{18:2} He also defeated the Moabites, and they became David’s subjects and brought tribute.
{18:3} David also defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah at Hamath when he went to establish his control at the Euphrates River.
{18:4} David captured 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers from him, hamstrung all the horses, and kept 100 chariots.
{18:5} When the Arameans of Damascus came to assist King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down 22,000 Aramean men.
{18:6} Then he placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became David’s subjects and brought tribute. The Lord made David victorious wherever he went.
{18:7} David took the gold shields carried by Hadadezer’s officers and brought them to Jerusalem.
{18:8} From Tibhath and Cun, Hadadezer’s cities, David also took huge quantities of bronze, from which Solomon made the bronze reservoir, the pillars, and the bronze articles.
{18:9} When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of King Hadadezer of Zobah,
{18:10} he sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet him and to congratulate him because David had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him, for Tou and Hadadezer had fought many wars. Hadoram brought all kinds of gold, silver, and bronze items.
{18:11} King David also dedicated these to the Lord, along with the silver and gold he had carried off from all the nations — from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and the Amalekites.
{18:12} Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
{18:13} He put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites were subject to David. The Lord made David victorious wherever he went.
{18:14} So David reigned over all Israel, administering justice and righteousness for all his people.
{18:15} Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was court historian;
{18:16} Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was court secretary;
{18:17} Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were the chief officials at the king’s side.
{i19:1} War with the Ammonites
{19:1} Some time later, King Nahash of the Ammonites died, and his son became king in his place.
{19:2} Then David said, “I’ll show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. However, when David’s emissaries arrived in the land of the Ammonites to console him,
{19:3} the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, “Just because David has sent men with condolences for you, do you really believe he’s showing respect for your father? Instead, hasn’t David sent his emissaries in order to scout out, overthrow, and spy on the land?”
{19:4} So Hanun took David’s emissaries, shaved them, cut their clothes in half at the hips, and sent them away.
{19:5} It was reported to David about his men, so he sent messengers to meet them, since the men were deeply humiliated. The king said, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back; then return.”
{19:6} When the Ammonites realized they had made themselves repulsive to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 38 tons of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah.
{19:7} They hired 32,000 chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came and camped near Medeba. The Ammonites also came together from their cities for the battle.
{19:8} David heard about this and sent Joab and the entire army of warriors.
{19:9} The Ammonites marched out and lined up in battle formation at the entrance of the city while the kings who had come were in the field by themselves.
{19:10} When Joab saw that there was a battle line in front of him and another behind him, he chose some men out of all the elite troops of Israel and lined up in battle formation to engage the Arameans.
{19:11} He placed the rest of the forces under the command of his brother Abishai, and they lined up in battle formation to engage the Ammonites.
{19:12} “If the Arameans are too strong for me,” Joab said, “then you’ll be my help. However, if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I’ll help you.
{19:13} Be strong! We must prove ourselves strong for our people and for the cities of our God. May the Lord’s will be done.”
{19:14} Joab and the people with him approached the Arameans for battle, and they fled before him.
{19:15} When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they likewise fled before Joab’s brother Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab went to Jerusalem.
{19:16} When the Arameans realized that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers to summon the Arameans who were across the Euphrates. They were led by Shophach, the commander of Hadadezer’s army.
{19:17} When this was reported to David, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan. He came up to the Arameans and lined up in battle formation against them. When David lined up to engage them in battle, they fought against him.
{19:18} But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed 7,000 of their charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach, commander of the army.
{19:19} When Hadadezer’s subjects saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his subjects. After this, the Arameans were never willing to help the Ammonites again.
{i20:1} Capture of the City of Rabbah
{20:1} In the spring when kings march out to war, Joab led the army and destroyed the Ammonites’ land. He came to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and demolished it.
{20:2} Then David took the crown from the head of their king, and it was placed on David’s head. He found that the crown weighed 75 pounds of gold, and there was a precious stone in it. In addition, David took away a large quantity of plunder from the city.
{20:3} He brought out the people who were in it and put them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes. David did the same to all the Ammonite cities. Then he and all his troops returned to Jerusalem.
{i20:4} The Philistine Giants
{20:4} After this, a war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, a descendant of the giants, and the Philistines were subdued.
{20:5} Once again there was a battle with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite. The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam.
{20:6} There was still another battle at Gath where there was a man of extraordinary stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot — 24 in all. He, too, was descended from the giant.
{20:7} When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of David’s brother Shimei killed him.
{20:8} These were the descendants of the giant in Gath killed by David and his soldiers.
{i21:1} David’s Military Census
{21:1} Satan stood up against Israel and incited David to count the people of Israel.
{21:2} So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count Israel from Beer-sheba to Dan and bring a report to me so I can know their number.”
{21:3} Joab replied, “May the Lord multiply the number of His people a hundred times over! My lord the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?”
{21:4} Yet the king’s order prevailed over Joab. So Joab left and traveled throughout Israel and then returned to Jerusalem.
{21:5} Joab gave the total troop registration to David. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 swordsmen and in Judah itself 470,000 swordsmen.
{21:6} But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the count because the king’s command was detestable to him.
{21:7} This command was also evil in God’s sight, so He afflicted Israel.
{21:8} David said to God, “I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing. Now, please take away Your servant’s guilt, for I’ve been very foolish.”
{i21:9} David’s Punishment
{21:9} Then the Lord instructed Gad, David’s seer,
{21:10} “Go and say to David, ‘This is what the Lord says: I am offering you three choices. Choose one of them for yourself, and I will do it to you.’”
{21:11} So Gad went to David and said to him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Take your choice:
{21:12} three years of famine, or three months of devastation by your foes with the sword of your enemy overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the Lord — a plague on the land, the angel of the Lord bringing destruction to the whole territory of Israel.’ Now decide what answer I should take back to the One who sent me.”
{21:13} David answered Gad, “I’m in anguish. Please, let me fall into the Lord’s hands because His mercies are very great, but don’t let me fall into human hands.”
{21:14} So the Lord sent a plague on Israel, and 70,000 Israelite men died.
{21:15} Then God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but when the angel was about to destroy the city, the Lord looked, relented concerning the destruction, and said to the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough, withdraw your hand now!” The angel of the Lord was then standing at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
{21:16} When David looked up and saw the angel of the Lord standing between earth and heaven, with his drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem, David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell down with their faces to the ground.
{21:17} David said to God, “Wasn’t I the one who gave the order to count the people? I am the one who has sinned and acted very wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? My Lord God, please let Your hand be against me and against my father’s family, but don’t let the plague be against Your people.”
{i21:18} David’s Altar
{21:18} So the angel of the Lord ordered Gad to tell David to go and set up an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
{21:19} David went up at Gad’s command spoken in the name of the Lord.
{21:20} Ornan was threshing wheat when he turned and saw the angel. His four sons, who were with him, hid themselves.
{21:21} David came to Ornan, and when Ornan looked and saw David, he left the threshing floor and bowed to David with his face to the ground.
{21:22} Then David said to Ornan, “Give me this threshing-floor plot so that I may build an altar to the Lord on it. Give it to me for the full price, so the plague on the people may be stopped.”
{21:23} Ornan said to David, “Take it! My lord the king may do whatever he wants. See, I give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering — I give it all.”
{21:24} King David answered Ornan, “No, I insist on paying the full price, for I will not take for the Lord what belongs to you or offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.”
{21:25} So David gave Ornan 15 pounds of gold for the plot.
{21:26} He built an altar to the Lord there and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on the Lord, and He answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
{21:27} Then the Lord spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.
{21:28} At that time, David offered sacrifices there when he saw that the Lord answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
{21:29} The tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of burnt offering were at the high place in Gibeon,
{21:30} but David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was terrified of the sword of the Lord’s angel.
{22:1} Then David said, “This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”
{i22:2} David’s Preparations for the Temple
{22:2} So David gave orders to gather the foreigners that were in the land of Israel, and he appointed stonecutters to cut finished stones for building God’s house.
{22:3} David supplied a great deal of iron to make the nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, together with an immeasurable quantity of bronze,
{22:4} and innumerable cedar logs because the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought a large quantity of cedar logs to David.
{22:5} David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly great and famous and glorious in all the lands. Therefore, I must make provision for it.” So David made lavish preparations for it before his death.
{22:6} Then he summoned his son Solomon and instructed him to build a house for the Lord God of Israel.
{22:7} “My son,” David said to Solomon, “It was in my heart to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God,
{22:8} but the word of the Lord came to me: ‘You have shed much blood and waged great wars. You are not to build a house for My name because you have shed so much blood on the ground before Me.
{22:9} But a son will be born to you; he will be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his surrounding enemies, for his name will be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel during his reign.
{22:10} He is the one who will build a house for My name. He will be My son, and I will be his father. I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’
{22:11} “Now, my son, may the Lord be with you, and may you succeed in building the house of the Lord your God, as He said about you.
{22:12} Above all, may the Lord give you insight and understanding when He puts you in charge of Israel so that you may keep the law of the Lord your God.
{22:13} Then you will succeed if you carefully follow the statutes and ordinances the Lord commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or discouraged.
{22:14} “Notice I have taken great pains to provide for the house of the Lord — 3,775 tons of gold, 37,750 tons of silver, and bronze and iron that can’t be weighed because there is so much of it. I have also provided timber and stone, but you will need to add more to them.
{22:15} You also have many workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and people skilled in every kind of work
{22:16} in gold, silver, bronze, and iron — beyond number. Now begin the work, and may the Lord be with you.”
{22:17} Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon:
{22:18} “The Lord your God is with you, isn’t He? And hasn’t He given you rest on every side? For He has handed the land’s inhabitants over to me, and the land has been subdued before the Lord and His people.
{22:19} Now determine in your mind and heart to seek the Lord your God. Get started building the Lord God’s sanctuary so that you may bring the ark of the Lord’s covenant and the holy articles of God to the temple that is to be built for the name of Yahweh.”
{i23:1} The Divisions of the Levites
{23:1} When David was old and full of days, he installed his son Solomon as king over Israel.
{23:2} Then he gathered all the leaders of Israel, the priests, and the Levites.
{23:3} The Levites 30 years old or more were counted; the total number of men was 38,000 by headcount.
{23:4} “Of these,” David said, “24,000 are to be in charge of the work on the Lord’s temple, 6,000 are to be officers and judges,
{23:5} 4,000 are to be gatekeepers, and 4,000 are to praise the Lord with the instruments that I have made for worship.”
{23:6} Then David divided them into divisions according to Levi’s sons: Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.
{23:7} The Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.
{23:8} Ladan’s sons: Jehiel was the first, then Zetham, and Joel — three.
{23:9} Shimei’s sons: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran — three. Those were the heads of the families of Ladan.
{23:10} Shimei’s sons: Jahath, Zizah, Jeush, and Beriah. Those were Shimei’s sons — four.
{23:11} Jahath was the first and Zizah was the second; however, Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they became an ancestral house and received a single assignment.
{23:12} Kohath’s sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel — four.
{23:13} Amram’s sons: Aaron and Moses. Aaron, along with his descendants, was set apart forever to consecrate the most holy things, to burn incense in the presence of Yahweh, to minister to Him, and to pronounce blessings in His name forever.
{23:14} As for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.
{23:15} Moses’ sons: Gershom and Eliezer.
{23:16} Gershom’s sons: Shebuel was first.
{23:17} Eliezer’s sons were Rehabiah, first; Eliezer did not have any other sons, but Rehabiah’s sons were very numerous.
{23:18} Izhar’s sons: Shelomith was first.
{23:19} Hebron’s sons: Jeriah was first, Amariah second, Jahaziel third, and Jekameam fourth.
{23:20} Uzziel’s sons: Micah was first, and Isshiah second.
{23:21} Merari’s sons: Mahli and Mushi. Mahli’s sons: Eleazar and Kish.
{23:22} Eleazar died having no sons, only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.
{23:23} Mushi’s sons: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth — three.
{23:24} These were the sons of Levi by their ancestral houses — the heads of families, according to their registration by name in the headcount — 20 years old or more, who worked in the service of the Lord’s temple.
{23:25} For David said, “The Lord God of Israel has given rest to His people, and He has come to stay in Jerusalem forever.
{23:26} Also, the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the equipment for its service” —
{23:27} for according to the last words of David, the Levites 20 years old or more were to be counted —
{23:28} “but their duty will be to assist the sons of Aaron with the service of the Lord’s temple, being responsible for the courts and the chambers, the purification of all the holy things, and the work of the service of God’s temple —
{23:29} as well as the rows of the bread of the Presence, the fine flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baking, the mixing, and all measurements of volume and length.
{23:30} They are also to stand every morning to give thanks and praise to the Lord, and likewise in the evening.
{23:31} Whenever burnt offerings are offered to the Lord on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed festivals, they are to do so regularly in the Lord’s presence according to the number prescribed for them.
{23:32} They are to carry out their responsibilities for the tent of meeting, for the holy place, and for their relatives, the sons of Aaron, in the service of the Lord’s temple.”
{i24:1} The Divisions of the Priests
{24:1} The divisions of the descendants of Aaron were as follows: Aaron’s sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
{24:2} But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and they had no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.
{24:3} Together with Zadok from the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech from the sons of Ithamar, David divided them according to the assigned duties of their service.
{24:4} Since more leaders were found among Eleazar’s descendants than Ithamar’s, they were divided accordingly: 16 heads of ancestral houses were from Eleazar’s descendants, and eight heads of ancestral houses were from Ithamar’s.
{24:5} They were assigned by lot, for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God among both Eleazar’s and Ithamar’s descendants.
{24:6} The secretary, Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded them in the presence of the king and the officers, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of families of the priests and the Levites. One ancestral house was taken for Eleazar, and then one for Ithamar.
{24:7} The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
{24:8} the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
{24:9} the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
{24:10} the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
{24:11} the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
{24:12} the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
{24:13} the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
{24:14} the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
{24:15} the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,
{24:16} the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,
{24:17} the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
{24:18} the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
{24:19} These had their assigned duties for service when they entered the Lord’s temple, according to their regulations, which they received from their ancestor Aaron, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him.
{i24:20} The Rest of the Levites
{24:20} As for the rest of Levi’s sons: from Amram’s sons: Shubael; from Shubael’s sons: Jehdeiah.
{24:21} From Rehabiah: from Rehabiah’s sons: Isshiah was the first.
{24:22} From the Izharites: Shelomoth; from Shelomoth’s sons: Jahath.
{24:23} Hebron’s sons: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
{24:24} From Uzziel’s sons: Micah; from Micah’s sons: Shamir.
{24:25} Micah’s brother: Isshiah; from Isshiah’s sons: Zechariah.
{24:26} Merari’s sons: Mahli and Mushi, and from his sons, Jaaziah his son.
{24:27} Merari’s sons, by his son Jaaziah: Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
{24:28} From Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.
{24:29} From Kish, from Kish’s sons: Jerahmeel.
{24:30} Mushi’s sons: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. Those were the sons of the Levites according to their ancestral houses.
{24:31} They also cast lots the same way as their relatives the sons of Aaron did in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the families of the priests and Levites — the family heads and their younger brothers alike.
{i25:1} The Levitical Musicians
{25:1} David and the officers of the army also set apart some of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, who were to prophesy accompanied by lyres, harps, and cymbals. This is the list of the men who performed their service:
{25:2} From Asaph’s sons: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah, sons of Asaph, under Asaph’s authority, who prophesied under the authority of the king.
{25:3} From Jeduthun: Jeduthun’s sons: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah — six — under the authority of their father Jeduthun, prophesying to the accompaniment of lyres, giving thanks and praise to the Lord.
{25:4} From Heman: Heman’s sons: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth.
{25:5} All these sons of Heman, the king’s seer, were given by the promises of God to exalt him, for God had given Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
{25:6} All these men were under their own fathers’ authority for the music in the Lord’s temple, with cymbals, harps, and lyres for the service of God’s temple. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the king’s authority.
{25:7} They numbered 288 together with their relatives who were all trained and skillful in music for the Lord.
{25:8} They cast lots for their duties, young and old alike, teacher as well as pupil.
{25:9} The first lot for Asaph fell to Joseph, his sons, and his brothers — 12 to Gedaliah the second: him, his brothers, and his sons — 12

{25:31} and the twenty-fourth to Romamti-ezer, his sons, and his brothers — 12.
{i26:1} The Levitical Gatekeepers
{26:1} The following were the divisions of the gatekeepers: From the Korahites: Meshelemiah son of Kore, one of the sons of Asaph.
{26:2} Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,
{26:3} Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, and Eliehoenai the seventh.
{26:4} Obed-edom also had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sachar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth,
{26:5} Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, and Peullethai the eighth, for God blessed him.
{26:6} Also, to his son Shemaiah were born sons who ruled over their ancestral houses because they were strong, capable men.
{26:7} Shemaiah’s sons: Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad; his brothers Elihu and Semachiah were also capable men.
{26:8} All of these were among the sons of Obed-edom with their sons and brothers; they were capable men with strength for the work — 62 from Obed-edom.
{26:9} Meshelemiah also had sons and brothers who were capable men — 18.
{26:10} Hosah, from the Merarites, also had sons: Shimri the first (although he was not the firstborn, his father had appointed him as the first),
{26:11} Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, and Zechariah the fourth. The sons and brothers of Hosah were 13 in all.
{26:12} These divisions of the gatekeepers, under their leading men, had duties for ministering in the Lord’s temple, just as their brothers did.
{26:13} They cast lots for each gate according to their ancestral houses, young and old alike.
{26:14} The lot for the east gate fell to Shelemiah. They also cast lots for his son Zechariah, an insightful counselor, and his lot came out for the north gate.
{26:15} Obed-edom’s was the south gate, and his sons’ lot was for the storehouses;
{26:16} it was the west gate and the gate of Shallecheth on the ascending highway for Shuppim and Hosah. There were guards stationed at every watch.
{26:17} There were six Levites each day on the east, four each day on the north, four each day on the south, and two pair at the storehouses.
{26:18} As for the court on the west, there were four at the highway and two at the court.
{26:19} Those were the divisions of the gatekeepers from the sons of the Korahites and Merarites.
{i26:20} The Levitical Treasurers and Other Officials
{26:20} From the Levites, Ahijah was in charge of the treasuries of God’s temple and the treasuries of what had been dedicated.
{26:21} From the sons of Ladan, who were the sons of the Gershonites through Ladan and were the heads of families belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli.
{26:22} The sons of Jehieli, Zetham and his brother Joel, were in charge of the treasuries of the Lord’s temple.
{26:23} From the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites:
{26:24} Shebuel, a descendant of Moses’ son Gershom, was the officer in charge of the treasuries.
{26:25} His relative through Eliezer: his son Rehabiah, his son Jeshaiah, his son Joram, his son Zichri, and his son Shelomith.
{26:26} This Shelomith and his brothers were in charge of all the treasuries of what had been dedicated by King David, by the heads of families who were the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and by the army commanders.
{26:27} They dedicated part of the plunder from their battles for the repair of the Lord’s temple.
{26:28} All that Samuel the seer, Saul son of Kish, Abner son of Ner, and Joab son of Zeruiah had dedicated, along with everything else that had been dedicated, were in the care of Shelomith and his brothers.
{26:29} From the Izrahites: Chenaniah and his sons had the outside duties as officers and judges over Israel.

{26:31} From the Hebronites: Jerijah was the head of the Hebronites, according to the genealogical records of his ancestors. A search was made in the fortieth year of David’s reign and strong, capable men were found among them at Jazer in Gilead.
{26:32} There were among Jerijah’s relatives, 2,700 capable men who were heads of families. King David appointed them over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh as overseers in every matter relating to God and the king.
{i27:1} David’s Secular Officials
{27:1} This is the list of the Israelites, the heads of families, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, and their officers who served the king in every matter to do with the divisions that were on rotated military duty each month throughout the year. There were 24,000 in each division:
{27:2} Jashobeam son of Zabdiel was in charge of the first division, for the first month; 24,000 were in his division.
{27:3} He was a descendant of Perez and chief of all the army commanders for the first month.

{27:22} for Dan, Azarel son of Jeroham. Those were the leaders of the tribes of Israel.
{27:23} David didn’t count the men aged 20 or under, for the Lord had said He would make Israel as numerous as the stars of heaven.
{27:24} Joab son of Zeruiah began to count them, but he didn’t complete it. There was wrath against Israel because of this census, and the number was not entered in the Historical Record of King David.
{27:25} Azmaveth son of Adiel was in charge of the king’s storehouses. Jonathan son of Uzziah was in charge of the storehouses in the country, in the cities, in the villages, and in the fortresses.
{27:26} Ezri son of Chelub was in charge of those who worked in the fields tilling the soil.

{27:31} Jaziz the Hagrite was in charge of the flocks. All these were officials in charge of King David’s property.
{27:32} David’s uncle Jonathan was a counselor; he was a man of understanding and a scribe. Jehiel son of Hachmoni attended the king’s sons.
{27:33} Ahithophel was the king’s counselor. Hushai the Archite was the king’s friend.
{27:34} After Ahithophel came Jehoiada son of Benaiah, then Abiathar. Joab was the commander of the king’s army.
{i28:1} David Commissions Solomon to Build the Temple
{28:1} David assembled all the leaders of Israel in Jerusalem: the leaders of the tribes, the leaders of the divisions in the king’s service, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of all the property and cattle of the king and his sons, along with the court officials, the fighting men, and all the brave warriors.
{28:2} Then King David rose to his feet and said, “Listen to me, my brothers and my people. It was in my heart to build a house as a resting place for the ark of the Lord’s covenant and as a footstool for our God. I had made preparations to build,
{28:3} but God said to me, ‘You are not to build a house for My name because you are a man of war and have shed blood.’
{28:4} “Yet the Lord God of Israel chose me out of all my father’s household to be king over Israel forever. For He chose Judah as leader, and from the house of Judah, my father’s household, and from my father’s sons, He was pleased to make me king over all Israel.
{28:5} And out of all my sons — for the Lord has given me many sons — He has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the Lord’s kingdom over Israel.
{28:6} He said to me, ‘Your son Solomon is the one who is to build My house and My courts, for I have chosen him to be My son, and I will be his father.
{28:7} I will establish his kingdom forever if he perseveres in keeping My commands and My ordinances as he is today.’
{28:8} “So now in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the Lord, and in the hearing of our God, observe and follow all the commands of the Lord your God so that you may possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance to your descendants forever.
{28:9} “As for you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a whole heart and a willing mind, for the Lord searches every heart and understands the intention of every thought. If you seek Him, He will be found by you, but if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever.
{28:10} Realize now that the Lord has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong, and do it.”
{28:11} Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the portico of the temple and its buildings, treasuries, upper rooms, inner rooms, and a room for the mercy seat.
{28:12} The plans contained everything he had in mind for the courts of the Lord’s house, all the surrounding chambers, the treasuries of God’s house, and the treasuries for what is dedicated.
{28:13} Also included were plans for the divisions of the priests and the Levites; all the work of service in the Lord’s house; all the articles of service of the Lord’s house;
{28:14} the weight of gold for all the articles for every kind of service; the weight of all the silver articles for every kind of service;
{28:15} the weight of the gold lampstands and their gold lamps, including the weight of each lampstand and its lamps; the weight of each silver lampstand and its lamps, according to the service of each lampstand;
{28:16} the weight of gold for each table for the rows of the bread of the Presence and the silver for the silver tables;
{28:17} the pure gold for the forks, sprinkling basins, and pitchers; the weight of each gold dish; the weight of each silver bowl;
{28:18} the weight of refined gold for the altar of incense; and the plans for the chariot of the gold cherubim that spread out their wings and cover the ark of the Lord’s covenant.
{28:19} David concluded, “By the Lord’s hand on me, He enabled me to understand everything in writing, all the details of the plan.”
{28:20} Then David said to his son Solomon, “Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Don’t be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord God, my God, is with you. He won’t leave you or forsake you until all the work for the service of the Lord’s house is finished.
{28:21} Here are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of God’s house. Every willing man of any skill will be at your disposal for the work, and the leaders and all the people are at your every command.”
{i29:1} Contributions for Building the Temple
{29:1} Then King David said to all the assembly, “My son Solomon — God has chosen him alone — is young and inexperienced. The task is great because the temple will not be for man but for the Lord God.
{29:2} So to the best of my ability I’ve made provision for the house of my God: gold for the gold articles, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron, and wood for the wood, as well as onyx, stones for mounting, antimony, stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and a great quantity of marble.
{29:3} Moreover, because of my delight in the house of my God, I now give my personal treasures of gold and silver for the house of my God over and above all that I’ve provided for the holy house:
{29:4} 100 tons of gold (gold of Ophir ) and 250 tons of refined silver for overlaying the walls of the buildings,
{29:5} the gold for the gold work and the silver for the silver, for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now who will volunteer to consecrate himself to the Lord today?”
{29:6} Then the leaders of the households, the leaders of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king’s work gave willingly.
{29:7} For the service of God’s house they gave 185 tons of gold and 10,000 gold coins, 375 tons of silver, 675 tons of bronze, and 4,000 tons of iron.
{29:8} Whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the Lord’s house under the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.
{29:9} Then the people rejoiced because of their leaders’ willingness to give, for they had given to the Lord with a whole heart. King David also rejoiced greatly.
{i29:10} David’s Prayer
{29:10} Then David praised the Lord in the sight of all the assembly. David said, May You be praised, Lord God of our father Israel, from eternity to eternity.
{29:11} Yours, Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to You. Yours, Lord, is the kingdom, and You are exalted as head over all.
{29:12} Riches and honor come from You, and You are the ruler of everything. Power and might are in Your hand, and it is in Your hand to make great and to give strength to all.
{29:13} Now therefore, our God, we give You thanks and praise Your glorious name.
{29:14} But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? For everything comes from You, and we have given You only what comes from Your own hand.
{29:15} For we live before You as foreigners and temporary residents in Your presence as were all our ancestors. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.
{29:16} Yahweh our God, all this wealth that we’ve provided for building You a house for Your holy name comes from Your hand; everything belongs to You.
{29:17} I know, my God, that You test the heart and that You are pleased with what is right. I have willingly given all these things with an upright heart, and now I have seen Your people who are present here giving joyfully and willingly to You.
{29:18} Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our ancestors, keep this desire forever in the thoughts of the hearts of Your people, and confirm their hearts toward You.
{29:19} Give my son Solomon a whole heart to keep and to carry out all Your commands, Your decrees, and Your statutes, and to build the temple for which I have made provision.
{29:20} Then David said to the whole assembly, “Praise the Lord your God.” So the whole assembly praised the Lord God of their ancestors. They bowed down and paid homage to the Lord and the king.
{29:21} The following day they offered sacrifices to the Lord and burnt offerings to the Lord: 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs, along with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
{29:22} They ate and drank with great joy in the Lord’s presence that day. Then, for a second time, they made David’s son Solomon king; they anointed him as the Lord’s ruler, and Zadok as the priest.
{i29:23} The Enthronement of Solomon
{29:23} Solomon sat on the Lord’s throne as king in place of his father David. He prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.
{29:24} All the leaders and the mighty men, and all of King David’s sons as well, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.
{29:25} The Lord highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been bestowed on any king over Israel before him.
{i29:26} A Summary of David’s Life
{29:26} David son of Jesse was king over all Israel.
{29:27} The length of his reign over Israel was 40 years; he reigned in Hebron for seven years and in Jerusalem for 33.
{29:28} He died at a ripe old age, full of days, riches, and honor, and his son Solomon became king in his place.
{29:29} As for the events of King David’s reign, from beginning to end, note that they are written in the Events of Samuel the Seer, the Events of Nathan the Prophet, and the Events of Gad the Seer,
{29:30} along with all his reign, his might, and the incidents that affected him and Israel and all the kingdoms of the surrounding lands.
