{i1:1} BOOK I (Psalms 1–41) The Two Ways
{1:1} How happy is the man who does not follow the advice of the wicked or take the path of sinners or join a group of mockers!
{1:2} Instead, his delight is in the Lord’s instruction, and he meditates on it day and night.
{1:3} He is like a tree planted beside streams of water that bears its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers.
{1:4} The wicked are not like this; instead, they are like chaff that the wind blows away.
{1:5} Therefore the wicked will not survive the judgment, and sinners will not be in the community of the righteous.
{1:6} For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to ruin.
{i2:1} Coronation of the Son
{2:1} Why do the nations rebel and the peoples plot in vain?
{2:2} The kings of the earth take their stand, and the rulers conspire together against the Lord and His Anointed One:
{2:3} “Let us tear off their chains and free ourselves from their restraints.”
{2:4} The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord ridicules them.
{2:5} Then He speaks to them in His anger and terrifies them in His wrath:
{2:6} “I have consecrated My King on Zion, My holy mountain.”
{2:7} I will declare the Lord’s decree: He said to Me, “You are My Son; today I have become Your Father.
{2:8} Ask of Me, and I will make the nations Your inheritance and the ends of the earth Your possession.
{2:9} You will break them with a rod of iron; You will shatter them like pottery.”
{2:10} So now, kings, be wise; receive instruction, you judges of the earth.
{2:11} Serve the Lord with reverential awe and rejoice with trembling.
{2:12} Pay homage to the Son or He will be angry and you will perish in your rebellion, for His anger may ignite at any moment. All those who take refuge in Him are happy.
{i3:1} Confidence in Troubled Times A psalm of David when he fled from his son Absalom.
{3:1} Lord, how my foes increase! There are many who attack me.
{3:2} Many say about me, “There is no help for him in God.” Selah
{3:3} But You, Lord, are a shield around me, my glory, and the One who lifts up my head.
{3:4} I cry aloud to the Lord, and He answers me from His holy mountain. Selah
{3:5} I lie down and sleep; I wake again because the Lord sustains me.
{3:6} I am not afraid of the thousands of people who have taken their stand against me on every side.
{3:7} Rise up, Lord! Save me, my God! You strike all my enemies on the cheek; You break the teeth of the wicked.
{3:8} Salvation belongs to the Lord; may Your blessing be on Your people. Selah
{i4:1} A Night Prayer For the choir director: with stringed instruments. A Davidic psalm.
{4:1} Answer me when I call, God, who vindicates me. You freed me from affliction; be gracious to me and hear my prayer.
{4:2} How long, exalted men, will my honor be insulted? How long will you love what is worthless and pursue a lie? Selah
{4:3} Know that the Lord has set apart the faithful for Himself; the Lord will hear when I call to Him.
{4:4} Be angry and do not sin; on your bed, reflect in your heart and be still. Selah
{4:5} Offer sacrifices in righteousness and trust in the Lord.
{4:6} Many are saying, “Who can show us anything good?” Look on us with favor, Lord.
{4:7} You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and new wine abound.
{4:8} I will both lie down and sleep in peace, for You alone, Lord, make me live in safety.
{i5:1} The Refuge of the Righteous For the choir director: with the flutes. A Davidic psalm.
{5:1} Listen to my words, Lord; consider my sighing.
{5:2} Pay attention to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for I pray to You.
{5:3} At daybreak, Lord, You hear my voice; at daybreak I plead my case to You and watch expectantly.
{5:4} For You are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil cannot dwell with You.
{5:5} The boastful cannot stand in Your presence; You hate all evildoers.
{5:6} You destroy those who tell lies; the Lord abhors a man of bloodshed and treachery.
{5:7} But I enter Your house by the abundance of Your faithful love; I bow down toward Your holy temple in reverential awe of You.
{5:8} Lord, lead me in Your righteousness because of my adversaries; make Your way straight before me.
{5:9} For there is nothing reliable in what they say; destruction is within them; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongues.
{5:10} Punish them, God; let them fall by their own schemes. Drive them out because of their many crimes, for they rebel against You.
{5:11} But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; let them shout for joy forever. May You shelter them, and may those who love Your name boast about You.
{5:12} For You, Lord, bless the righteous one; You surround him with favor like a shield.
{i6:1} A Prayer for Mercy For the choir director: with stringed instruments, according to Sheminith . A Davidic psalm.
{6:1} Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger; do not discipline me in Your wrath.
{6:2} Be gracious to me, Lord, for I am weak; heal me, Lord, for my bones are shaking;
{6:3} my whole being is shaken with terror. And You, Lord — how long?
{6:4} Turn, Lord! Rescue me; save me because of Your faithful love.
{6:5} For there is no remembrance of You in death; who can thank You in Sheol?
{6:6} I am weary from my groaning; with my tears I dampen my pillow and drench my bed every night.
{6:7} My eyes are swollen from grief; they grow old because of all my enemies.
{6:8} Depart from me, all evildoers, for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping.
{6:9} The Lord has heard my plea for help; the Lord accepts my prayer.
{6:10} All my enemies will be ashamed and shake with terror; they will turn back and suddenly be disgraced.
{i7:1} Prayer for Justice A Shiggaion  Perhaps a passionate song with rapid changes of rhythm, or a dirge of David, which he sang to the Lord concerning the words of Cush, LXX, Aq, Sym, Theod, Jer read of the Cushite a Benjaminite.
{7:1} Yahweh my God, I seek refuge in You; save me from all my pursuers and rescue me
{7:2} or they will tear me like a lion, ripping me apart with no one to rescue me.
{7:3} Yahweh my God, if I have done this, if there is injustice on my hands,
{7:4} if I have done harm to one at peace with me or have plundered my adversary without cause,
{7:5} may an enemy pursue and overtake me; may he trample me to the ground and leave my honor in the dust. Selah
{7:6} Rise up, Lord, in Your anger; lift Yourself up against the fury of my adversaries; awake for me; You have ordained a judgment.
{7:7} Let the assembly of peoples gather around You; take Your seat on high over it.
{7:8} The Lord judges the peoples; vindicate me, Lord, according to my righteousness and my integrity.
{7:9} Let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous. The One who examines the thoughts and emotions is a righteous God.
{7:10} My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.
{7:11} God is a righteous judge and a God who shows His wrath every day.
{7:12} If anyone does not repent, God will sharpen His sword; He has strung His bow and made it ready.
{7:13} He has prepared His deadly weapons; He tips His arrows with fire.
{7:14} See, the wicked one is pregnant with evil, conceives trouble, and gives birth to deceit.
{7:15} He dug a pit and hollowed it out but fell into the hole he had made.
{7:16} His trouble comes back on his own head, and his violence falls on the top of his head.
{7:17} I will thank the Lord for His righteousness; I will sing about the name of Yahweh the Most High.
{i8:1} God’s Glory, Man’s Dignity For the choir director: on the Gittith . A Davidic psalm.
{8:1} Yahweh, our Lord, how magnificent is Your name throughout the earth! You have covered the heavens with Your majesty.
{8:2} Because of Your adversaries, You have established a stronghold from the mouths of children and nursing infants to silence the enemy and the avenger.
{8:3} When I observe Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You set in place,
{8:4} what is man that You remember him, the son of man that You look after him?
{8:5} You made him little less than God and crowned him with glory and honor.
{8:6} You made him lord over the works of Your hands; You put everything under his feet:
{8:7} all the sheep and oxen, as well as the animals in the wild,
{8:8} the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea that pass through the currents of the seas.
{8:9} Yahweh, our Lord, how magnificent is Your name throughout the earth!
{i9:1} Celebration of God’s Justice For the choir director: according to Muth-labben . Perhaps a musical term A Davidic psalm.
{9:1} I will thank Yahweh with all my heart; I will declare all Your wonderful works.
{9:2} I will rejoice and boast about You; I will sing about Your name, Most High.
{9:3} When my enemies retreat, they stumble and perish before You.
{9:4} For You have upheld my just cause; You are seated on Your throne as a righteous judge.
{9:5} You have rebuked the nations: You have destroyed the wicked; You have erased their name forever and ever.
{9:6} The enemy has come to eternal ruin; You have uprooted the cities, and the very memory of them has perished.
{9:7} But the Lord sits enthroned forever; He has established His throne for judgment.
{9:8} He judges the world with righteousness; He executes judgment on the nations with fairness.
{9:9} The Lord is a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
{9:10} Those who know Your name trust in You because You have not abandoned those who seek You, Yahweh.
{9:11} Sing to the Lord, who dwells in Zion; proclaim His deeds among the nations.
{9:12} For the One who seeks an accounting for bloodshed remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the afflicted.
{9:13} Be gracious to me, Lord; consider my affliction at the hands of those who hate me. Lift me up from the gates of death,
{9:14} so that I may declare all Your praises. I will rejoice in Your salvation within the gates of Daughter Zion.
{9:15} The nations have fallen into the pit they made; their foot is caught in the net they have concealed.
{9:16} The Lord has revealed Himself; He has executed justice, striking down the wicked by the work of their hands. Higgaion. Selah
{9:17} The wicked will return to Sheol — all the nations that forget God.
{9:18} For the oppressed will not always be forgotten; the hope of the afflicted will not perish forever.
{9:19} Rise up, Lord! Do not let man prevail; let the nations be judged in Your presence.
{9:20} Put terror in them, Lord; let the nations know they are only men. Selah
{10:1} Lord, why do You stand so far away? Why do You hide in times of trouble?
{10:2} In arrogance the wicked relentlessly pursue the afflicted; let them be caught in the schemes they have devised.
{10:3} For the wicked one boasts about his own cravings; the one who is greedy curses and despises the Lord.
{10:4} In all his scheming, the wicked arrogantly thinks: “There is no accountability, since God does not exist.”
{10:5} His ways are always secure; Your lofty judgments are beyond his sight; he scoffs at all his adversaries.
{10:6} He says to himself, “I will never be moved — from generation to generation without calamity.”
{10:7} Cursing, deceit, and violence fill his mouth; trouble and malice are under his tongue.
{10:8} He waits in ambush near the villages; he kills the innocent in secret places. His eyes are on the lookout for the helpless;
{10:9} he lurks in secret like a lion in a thicket. He lurks in order to seize the afflicted; he seizes the afflicted and drags him in his net.
{10:10} So he is oppressed and beaten down; the helpless fall because of his strength.
{10:11} He says to himself, “God has forgotten; He hides His face and will never see.”
{10:12} Rise up, Lord God! Lift up Your hand. Do not forget the afflicted.
{10:13} Why has the wicked person despised God? He says to himself, “You will not demand an account.”
{10:14} But You Yourself have seen trouble and grief, observing it in order to take the matter into Your hands. The helpless entrusts himself to You; You are a helper of the fatherless.
{10:15} Break the arm of the wicked and evil person; call his wickedness into account until nothing remains of it.
{10:16} The Lord is King forever and ever; the nations will perish from His land.
{10:17} Lord, You have heard the desire of the humble; You will strengthen their hearts. You will listen carefully,
{10:18} doing justice for the fatherless and the oppressed so that men of the earth may terrify them no more.
{i11:1} Refuge in the Lord For the choir director. Davidic.
{11:1} I have taken refuge in the Lord. How can you say to me, “Escape to the mountain like a bird!
{11:2} For look, the wicked string the bow; they put the arrow on the bowstring to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
{11:3} When the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?”
{11:4} The Lord is in His holy temple; the Lord’s throne is in heaven. His eyes watch; He examines everyone.
{11:5} The Lord examines the righteous and the wicked. He hates the lover of violence.
{11:6} He will rain burning coals and sulfur on the wicked; a scorching wind will be their portion.
{11:7} For the Lord is righteous; He loves righteous deeds. The upright will see His face.
{i12:1} Oppression by the Wicked For the choir director: according to Sheminith . A Davidic psalm.
{12:1} Help, Lord, for no faithful one remains; the loyal have disappeared from the human race.
{12:2} They lie to one another; they speak with flattering lips and deceptive hearts.
{12:3} May the Lord cut off all flattering lips and the tongue that speaks boastfully.
{12:4} They say, “Through our tongues we have power; our lips are our own — who can be our master?”
{12:5} “Because of the oppression of the afflicted and the groaning of the poor, I will now rise up,” says the Lord. “I will put the one who longs for it in a safe place.”
{12:6} The words of the Lord are pure words, like silver refined in an earthen furnace, purified seven times.
{12:7} You, Lord, will guard us; You will protect us from this generation forever.
{12:8} The wicked wander everywhere, and what is worthless is exalted by the human race.
{i13:1} A Plea for Deliverance For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.
{13:1} Lord, how long will You forget me? Forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?
{13:2} How long will I store up anxious concerns within me, agony in my mind every day? How long will my enemy dominate me?
{13:3} Consider me and answer, Lord my God. Restore brightness to my eyes; otherwise, I will sleep in death.
{13:4} My enemy will say, “I have triumphed over him,” and my foes will rejoice because I am shaken.
{13:5} But I have trusted in Your faithful love; my heart will rejoice in Your deliverance.
{13:6} I will sing to the Lord because He has treated me generously.
{i14:1} A Portrait of Sinners For the choir director. Davidic.
{14:1} The fool says in his heart, “God does not exist.” They are corrupt; they do vile deeds. There is no one who does good.
{14:2} The Lord looks down from heaven on the human race to see if there is one who is wise, one who seeks God.
{14:3} All have turned away; all alike have become corrupt. There is no one who does good, not even one.
{14:4} Will evildoers never understand? They consume My people as they consume bread; they do not call on the Lord.
{14:5} Then they will be filled with terror, for God is with those who are righteous.
{14:6} You sinners frustrate the plans of the afflicted, but the Lord is his refuge.
{14:7} Oh, that Israel’s deliverance would come from Zion! When the Lord restores the fortunes of His people, Jacob will rejoice; Israel will be glad.
{i15:1} A Description of the Godly A Davidic psalm.
{15:1} Lord, who can dwell in Your tent? Who can live on Your holy mountain?
{15:2} The one who lives honestly, practices righteousness, and acknowledges the truth in his heart —
{15:3} who does not slander with his tongue, who does not harm his friend or discredit his neighbor,
{15:4} who despises the one rejected by the Lord but honors those who fear the Lord, who keeps his word whatever the cost,
{15:5} who does not lend his money at interest or take a bribe against the innocent — the one who does these things will never be moved.
{i16:1} Confidence in the Lord A Davidic Miktam .
{16:1} Protect me, God, for I take refuge in You.
{16:2} I said to Yahweh, “You are my Lord; I have nothing good besides You.”
{16:3} As for the holy people who are in the land, they are the noble ones. All my delight is in them.
{16:4} The sorrows of those who take another god for themselves will multiply; I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood, and I will not speak their names with my lips.
{16:5} Lord, You are my portion and my cup of blessing; You hold my future.
{16:6} The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.
{16:7} I will praise the Lord who counsels me — even at night my conscience instructs me.
{16:8} I keep the Lord in mind always. Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
{16:9} Therefore my heart is glad and my spirit rejoices; my body also rests securely.
{16:10} For You will not abandon me to Sheol; You will not allow Your Faithful One to see decay.
{16:11} You reveal the path of life to me; in Your presence is abundant joy; in Your right hand are eternal pleasures.
{i17:1} A Prayer for Protection A Davidic prayer.
{17:1} Lord, hear a just cause; pay attention to my cry; listen to my prayer — from lips free of deceit.
{17:2} Let my vindication come from You, for You see what is right.
{17:3} You have tested my heart; You have examined me at night. You have tried me and found nothing evil; I have determined that my mouth will not sin.
{17:4} Concerning what people do: by the word of Your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.
{17:5} My steps are on Your paths; my feet have not slipped.
{17:6} I call on You, God, because You will answer me; listen closely to me; hear what I say.
{17:7} Display the wonders of Your faithful love, Savior of all who seek refuge from those who rebel against Your right hand.
{17:8} Protect me as the pupil of Your eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings
{17:9} from the wicked who treat me violently, my deadly enemies who surround me.
{17:10} They have become hardened; their mouths speak arrogantly.
{17:11} They advance against me; now they surround me. They are determined to throw me to the ground.
{17:12} They are like a lion eager to tear, like a young lion lurking in ambush.
{17:13} Rise up, Lord! Confront him; bring him down. With Your sword, save me from the wicked.
{17:14} With Your hand, Lord, save me from men, from men of the world whose portion is in this life: You fill their bellies with what You have in store; their sons are satisfied, and they leave their surplus to their children.
{17:15} But I will see Your face in righteousness; when I awake, I will be satisfied with Your presence.
{i18:1} Praise for Deliverance For the choir director. Of the servant of the Lord , David, who spoke the words of this song to the Lord on the day the Lord rescued him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:
{18:1} I love You, Lord, my strength.
{18:2} The Lord is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my mountain where I seek refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
{18:3} I called to the Lord, who is worthy of praise, and I was saved from my enemies.
{18:4} The ropes of death were wrapped around me; the torrents of destruction terrified me.
{18:5} The ropes of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.
{18:6} I called to the Lord in my distress, and I cried to my God for help. From His temple He heard my voice, and my cry to Him reached His ears.
{18:7} Then the earth shook and quaked; the foundations of the mountains trembled; they shook because He burned with anger.
{18:8} Smoke rose from His nostrils, and consuming fire came from His mouth; coals were set ablaze by it.
{18:9} He parted the heavens and came down, a dark cloud beneath His feet.
{18:10} He rode on a cherub and flew, soaring on the wings of the wind.
{18:11} He made darkness His hiding place, dark storm clouds His canopy around Him.
{18:12} From the radiance of His presence, His clouds swept onward with hail and blazing coals.
{18:13} The Lord thundered from heaven; the Most High projected His voice.
{18:14} He shot His arrows and scattered them; He hurled lightning bolts and routed them.
{18:15} The depths of the sea became visible, the foundations of the world were exposed, at Your rebuke, Lord, at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
{18:16} He reached down from heaven and took hold of me; He pulled me out of deep waters.
{18:17} He rescued me from my powerful enemy and from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.
{18:18} They confronted me in the day of my distress, but the Lord was my support.
{18:19} He brought me out to a spacious place; He rescued me because He delighted in me.
{18:20} The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; He repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands.
{18:21} For I have kept the ways of the Lord and have not turned from my God to wickedness.
{18:22} Indeed, I have kept all His ordinances in mind and have not disregarded His statutes.
{18:23} I was blameless toward Him and kept myself from sinning.
{18:24} So the Lord repaid me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in His sight.
{18:25} With the faithful You prove Yourself faithful; with the blameless man You prove Yourself blameless;
{18:26} with the pure You prove Yourself pure, but with the crooked You prove Yourself shrewd.
{18:27} For You rescue an afflicted people, but You humble those with haughty eyes.
{18:28} Lord, You light my lamp; my God illuminates my darkness.
{18:29} With You I can attack a barrier, and with my God I can leap over a wall.
{18:30} God — His way is perfect; the word of the Lord is pure. He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.
{18:31} For who is God besides Yahweh? And who is a rock? Only our God.
{18:32} God — He clothes me with strength and makes my way perfect.
{18:33} He makes my feet like the feet of a deer and sets me securely on the heights.
{18:34} He trains my hands for war; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
{18:35} You have given me the shield of Your salvation; Your right hand upholds me, and Your humility exalts me.
{18:36} You widen a place beneath me for my steps, and my ankles do not give way.
{18:37} I pursue my enemies and overtake them; I do not turn back until they are wiped out.
{18:38} I crush them, and they cannot get up; they fall beneath my feet.
{18:39} You have clothed me with strength for battle; You subdue my adversaries beneath me.
{18:40} You have made my enemies retreat before me; I annihilate those who hate me.
{18:41} They cry for help, but there is no one to save them — they cry to the Lord, but He does not answer them.
{18:42} I pulverize them like dust before the wind; I trample them like mud in the streets.
{18:43} You have freed me from the feuds among the people; You have appointed me the head of nations; a people I had not known serve me.
{18:44} Foreigners submit to me grudgingly; as soon as they hear, they obey me.
{18:45} Foreigners lose heart and come trembling from their fortifications.
{18:46} The Lord lives — may my rock be praised! The God of my salvation is exalted.
{18:47} God — He gives me vengeance and subdues peoples under me.
{18:48} He frees me from my enemies. You exalt me above my adversaries; You rescue me from violent men.
{18:49} Therefore I will praise You, Yahweh, among the nations; I will sing about Your name.
{18:50} He gives great victories to His king; He shows loyalty to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.
{i19:1} The Witness of Creation and Scripture For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.
{19:1} The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky proclaims the work of His hands.
{19:2} Day after day they pour out speech; night after night they communicate knowledge.
{19:3} There is no speech; there are no words; their voice is not heard.
{19:4} Their message has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun.
{19:5} It is like a groom coming from the bridal chamber; it rejoices like an athlete running a course.
{19:6} It rises from one end of the heavens and circles to their other end; nothing is hidden from its heat.
{19:7} The instruction of the Lord is perfect, renewing one’s life; the testimony of the Lord is trustworthy, making the inexperienced wise.
{19:8} The precepts of the Lord are right, making the heart glad; the command of the Lord is radiant, making the eyes light up.
{19:9} The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever; the ordinances of the Lord are reliable and altogether righteous.
{19:10} They are more desirable than gold — than an abundance of pure gold; and sweeter than honey, which comes from the honeycomb.
{19:11} In addition, Your servant is warned by them; there is great reward in keeping them.
{19:12} Who perceives his unintentional sins? Cleanse me from my hidden faults.
{19:13} Moreover, keep Your servant from willful sins; do not let them rule over me. Then I will be innocent and cleansed from blatant rebellion.
{19:14} May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable to You, Lord, my rock and my Redeemer.
{i20:1} Deliverance in Battle For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.
{20:1} May Yahweh answer you in a day of trouble; may the name of Jacob’s God protect you.
{20:2} May He send you help from the sanctuary and sustain you from Zion.
{20:3} May He remember all your offerings and accept your burnt offering. Selah
{20:4} May He give you what your heart desires and fulfill your whole purpose.
{20:5} Let us shout for joy at your victory and lift the banner in the name of our God. May Yahweh fulfill all your requests.
{20:6} Now I know that the Lord gives victory to His anointed; He will answer him from His holy heaven with mighty victories from His right hand.
{20:7} Some take pride in chariots, and others in horses, but we take pride in the name of Yahweh our God.
{20:8} They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand firm.
{20:9} Lord, give victory to the king! May He answer us on the day that we call.
{i21:1} The King’s Victory For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.
{21:1} Lord, the king finds joy in Your strength. How greatly he rejoices in Your victory!
{21:2} You have given him his heart’s desire and have not denied the request of his lips. Selah
{21:3} For You meet him with rich blessings; You place a crown of pure gold on his head.
{21:4} He asked You for life, and You gave it to him — length of days forever and ever.
{21:5} His glory is great through Your victory; You confer majesty and splendor on him.
{21:6} You give him blessings forever; You cheer him with joy in Your presence.
{21:7} For the king relies on the Lord; through the faithful love of the Most High he is not shaken.
{21:8} Your hand will capture all your enemies; your right hand will seize those who hate you.
{21:9} You will make them burn like a fiery furnace when you appear; the Lord will engulf them in His wrath, and fire will devour them.
{21:10} You will wipe their descendants from the earth and their offspring from the human race.
{21:11} Though they intend to harm you and devise a wicked plan, they will not prevail.
{21:12} Instead, you will put them to flight when you aim your bow at their faces.
{21:13} Be exalted, Lord, in Your strength; we will sing and praise Your might.
{i22:1} From Suffering to Praise For the choir director: according to “The Deer of the Dawn.” Perhaps a musical term A Davidic psalm.
{22:1} My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? Why are You so far from my deliverance and from my words of groaning?
{22:2} My God, I cry by day, but You do not answer, by night, yet I have no rest.
{22:3} But You are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.
{22:4} Our fathers trusted in You; they trusted, and You rescued them.
{22:5} They cried to You and were set free; they trusted in You and were not disgraced.
{22:6} But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by men and despised by people.
{22:7} Everyone who sees me mocks me; they sneer and shake their heads:
{22:8} “He relies on the Lord; let Him rescue him; let the Lord deliver him, since He takes pleasure in him.”
{22:9} You took me from the womb, making me secure while at my mother’s breast.
{22:10} I was given over to You at birth; You have been my God from my mother’s womb.
{22:11} Do not be far from me, because distress is near and there is no one to help.
{22:12} Many bulls surround me; strong ones of Bashan encircle me.
{22:13} They open their mouths against me — lions, mauling and roaring.
{22:14} I am poured out like water, and all my bones are disjointed; my heart is like wax, melting within me.
{22:15} My strength is dried up like baked clay; my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You put me into the dust of death.
{22:16} For dogs have surrounded me; a gang of evildoers has closed in on me; they pierced my hands and my feet.
{22:17} I can count all my bones; people look and stare at me.
{22:18} They divided my garments among themselves, and they cast lots for my clothing.
{22:19} But You, Lord, don’t be far away. My strength, come quickly to help me.
{22:20} Deliver my life from the sword, my only life from the power of these dogs.
{22:21} Save me from the mouth of the lion! You have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen.
{22:22} I will proclaim Your name to my brothers; I will praise You in the congregation.
{22:23} You who fear Yahweh, praise Him! All you descendants of Jacob, honor Him! All you descendants of Israel, revere Him!
{22:24} For He has not despised or detested the torment of the afflicted. He did not hide His face from him but listened when he cried to Him for help.
{22:25} I will give praise in the great congregation because of You; I will fulfill my vows before those who fear You.
{22:26} The humble will eat and be satisfied; those who seek the Lord will praise Him. May your hearts live forever!
{22:27} All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the Lord. All the families of the nations will bow down before You,
{22:28} for kingship belongs to the Lord; He rules over the nations.
{22:29} All who prosper on earth will eat and bow down; all those who go down to the dust will kneel before Him — even the one who cannot preserve his life.
{22:30} Their descendants will serve Him; the next generation will be told about the Lord.
{22:31} They will come and tell a people yet to be born about His righteousness — what He has done.
{i23:1} The Good Shepherd A Davidic psalm.
{23:1} The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I lack.
{23:2} He lets me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.
{23:3} He renews my life; He leads me along the right paths for His name’s sake.
{23:4} Even when I go through the darkest valley, I fear no danger, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff — they comfort me.
{23:5} You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
{23:6} Only goodness and faithful love will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord as long as I live.
{i24:1} The King of Glory A Davidic psalm.
{24:1} The earth and everything in it, the world and its inhabitants, belong to the Lord;
{24:2} for He laid its foundation on the seas and established it on the rivers.
{24:3} Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord? Who may stand in His holy place?
{24:4} The one who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not set his mind on what is false, and who has not sworn deceitfully.
{24:5} He will receive blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
{24:6} Such is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob. Selah
{24:7} Lift up your heads, you gates! Rise up, ancient doors! Then the King of glory will come in.
{24:8} Who is this King of glory? The Lord, strong and mighty, the Lord, mighty in battle.
{24:9} Lift up your heads, you gates! Rise up, ancient doors! Then the King of glory will come in.
{24:10} Who is He, this King of glory? The Lord of Hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah
{i25:1} Dependence on the Lord Davidic.
{25:1} Lord, I turn to You.
{25:2} My God, I trust in You. Do not let me be disgraced; do not let my enemies gloat over me.
{25:3} No one who waits for You will be disgraced; those who act treacherously without cause will be disgraced.
{25:4} Make Your ways known to me, Lord; teach me Your paths.
{25:5} Guide me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; I wait for You all day long.
{25:6} Remember, Lord, Your compassion and Your faithful love, for they have existed from antiquity.
{25:7} Do not remember the sins of my youth or my acts of rebellion; in keeping with Your faithful love, remember me because of Your goodness, Lord.
{25:8} The Lord is good and upright; therefore He shows sinners the way.
{25:9} He leads the humble in what is right and teaches them His way.
{25:10} All the Lord’s ways show faithful love and truth to those who keep His covenant and decrees.
{25:11} Because of Your name, Yahweh, forgive my sin, for it is great.
{25:12} Who is the man who fears the Lord? He will show him the way he should choose.
{25:13} He will live a good life, and his descendants will inherit the land.
{25:14} The secret counsel of the Lord is for those who fear Him, and He reveals His covenant to them.
{25:15} My eyes are always on the Lord, for He will pull my feet out of the net.
{25:16} Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am alone and afflicted.
{25:17} The distresses of my heart increase; bring me out of my sufferings.
{25:18} Consider my affliction and trouble, and take away all my sins.
{25:19} Consider my enemies; they are numerous, and they hate me violently.
{25:20} Guard me and deliver me; do not let me be put to shame, for I take refuge in You.
{25:21} May integrity and what is right watch over me, for I wait for You.
{25:22} God, redeem Israel, from all its distresses.
{i26:1} Prayer for Vindication Davidic.
{26:1} Vindicate me, Lord, because I have lived with integrity and have trusted in the Lord without wavering.
{26:2} Test me, Lord, and try me; examine my heart and mind.
{26:3} For Your faithful love is before my eyes, and I live by Your truth.
{26:4} I do not sit with the worthless or associate with hypocrites.
{26:5} I hate a crowd of evildoers, and I do not sit with the wicked.
{26:6} I wash my hands in innocence and go around Your altar, Lord,
{26:7} raising my voice in thanksgiving and telling about Your wonderful works.
{26:8} Lord, I love the house where You dwell, the place where Your glory resides.
{26:9} Do not destroy me along with sinners, or my life along with men of bloodshed
{26:10} in whose hands are evil schemes and whose right hands are filled with bribes.
{26:11} But I live with integrity; redeem me and be gracious to me.
{26:12} My foot stands on level ground; I will praise the Lord in the assemblies.
{i27:1} My Stronghold Davidic.
{27:1} The Lord is my light and my salvation — whom should I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life — of whom should I be afraid?
{27:2} When evildoers came against me to devour my flesh, my foes and my enemies stumbled and fell.
{27:3} Though an army deploys against me, my heart is not afraid; though a war breaks out against me, still I am confident.
{27:4} I have asked one thing from the Lord; it is what I desire: to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, gazing on the beauty of the Lord and seeking Him in His temple.
{27:5} For He will conceal me in His shelter in the day of adversity; He will hide me under the cover of His tent; He will set me high on a rock.
{27:6} Then my head will be high above my enemies around me; I will offer sacrifices in His tent with shouts of joy. I will sing and make music to the Lord.
{27:7} Lord, hear my voice when I call; be gracious to me and answer me.
{27:8} My heart says this about You, “You are to seek My face.” Lord, I will seek Your face.
{27:9} Do not hide Your face from me; do not turn Your servant away in anger. You have been my helper; do not leave me or abandon me, God of my salvation.
{27:10} Even if my father and mother abandon me, the Lord cares for me.
{27:11} Because of my adversaries, show me Your way, Lord, and lead me on a level path.
{27:12} Do not give me over to the will of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing violence.
{27:13} I am certain that I will see the Lord’s goodness in the land of the living.
{27:14} Wait for the Lord; be strong and courageous. Wait for the Lord.
{i28:1} My Strength Davidic.
{28:1} Lord, I call to You; my rock, do not be deaf to me. If You remain silent to me, I will be like those going down to the Pit.
{28:2} Listen to the sound of my pleading when I cry to You for help, when I lift up my hands toward Your holy sanctuary.
{28:3} Do not drag me away with the wicked, with the evildoers, who speak in friendly ways with their neighbors while malice is in their hearts.
{28:4} Repay them according to what they have done — according to the evil of their deeds. Repay them according to the work of their hands; give them back what they deserve.
{28:5} Because they do not consider what the Lord has done or the work of His hands, He will tear them down and not rebuild them.
{28:6} May the Lord be praised, for He has heard the sound of my pleading.
{28:7} The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in Him, and I am helped. Therefore my heart rejoices, and I praise Him with my song.
{28:8} The Lord is the strength of His people; He is a stronghold of salvation for His anointed.
{28:9} Save Your people, bless Your possession, shepherd them, and carry them forever.
{i29:1} The Voice of the Lord A Davidic psalm.
{29:1} Ascribe to Yahweh, you heavenly beings, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
{29:2} Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due His name; worship Yahweh in the splendor of His holiness.
{29:3} The voice of the Lord is above the waters. The God of glory thunders — the Lord, above vast waters,
{29:4} the voice of the Lord in power, the voice of the Lord in splendor.
{29:5} The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars; the Lord shatters the cedars of Lebanon.
{29:6} He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, and Sirion, like a young wild ox.
{29:7} The voice of the Lord flashes flames of fire.
{29:8} The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness; the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
{29:9} The voice of the Lord makes the deer give birth and strips the woodlands bare. In His temple all cry, “Glory!”
{29:10} The Lord sat enthroned at the flood; the Lord sits enthroned, King forever.
{29:11} The Lord gives His people strength; the Lord blesses His people with peace.
{i30:1} Joy in the Morning A psalm; a dedication song for the house. Davidic.
{30:1} I will exalt You, Lord, because You have lifted me up and have not allowed my enemies to triumph over me.
{30:2} Lord my God, I cried to You for help, and You healed me.
{30:3} Lord, You brought me up from Sheol; You spared me from among those going down to the Pit.
{30:4} Sing to Yahweh, you His faithful ones, and praise His holy name.
{30:5} For His anger lasts only a moment, but His favor, a lifetime. Weeping may spend the night, but there is joy in the morning.
{30:6} When I was secure, I said, “I will never be shaken.”
{30:7} Lord, when You showed Your favor, You made me stand like a strong mountain; when You hid Your face, I was terrified.
{30:8} Lord, I called to You; I sought favor from my Lord:
{30:9} “What gain is there in my death, if I go down to the Pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it proclaim Your truth?
{30:10} Lord, listen and be gracious to me; Lord, be my helper.”
{30:11} You turned my lament into dancing; You removed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness,
{30:12} so that I can sing to You and not be silent. Lord my God, I will praise You forever.
{i31:1} A Plea for Protection For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.
{31:1} Lord, I seek refuge in You; let me never be disgraced. Save me by Your righteousness.
{31:2} Listen closely to me; rescue me quickly. Be a rock of refuge for me, a mountain fortress to save me.
{31:3} For You are my rock and my fortress; You lead and guide me because of Your name.
{31:4} You will free me from the net that is secretly set for me, for You are my refuge.
{31:5} Into Your hand I entrust my spirit; You redeem me, Lord, God of truth.
{31:6} I hate those who are devoted to worthless idols, but I trust in the Lord.
{31:7} I will rejoice and be glad in Your faithful love because You have seen my affliction. You have known the troubles of my life
{31:8} and have not handed me over to the enemy. You have set my feet in a spacious place.
{31:9} Be gracious to me, Lord, because I am in distress; my eyes are worn out from angry sorrow — my whole being as well.
{31:10} Indeed, my life is consumed with grief and my years with groaning; my strength has failed because of my sinfulness, and my bones waste away.
{31:11} I am ridiculed by all my adversaries and even by my neighbors. I am dreaded by my acquaintances; those who see me in the street run from me.
{31:12} I am forgotten: gone from memory like a dead person — like broken pottery.
{31:13} I have heard the gossip of many; terror is on every side. When they conspired against me, they plotted to take my life.
{31:14} But I trust in You, Lord; I say, “You are my God.”
{31:15} The course of my life is in Your power; deliver me from the power of my enemies and from my persecutors.
{31:16} Show Your favor to Your servant; save me by Your faithful love.
{31:17} Lord, do not let me be disgraced when I call on You. Let the wicked be disgraced; let them be silent in Sheol.
{31:18} Let lying lips be quieted; they speak arrogantly against the righteous with pride and contempt.
{31:19} How great is Your goodness that You have stored up for those who fear You and accomplished in the sight of everyone for those who take refuge in You.
{31:20} You hide them in the protection of Your presence; You conceal them in a shelter from the schemes of men, from quarrelsome tongues.
{31:21} May the Lord be praised, for He has wonderfully shown His faithful love to me in a city under siege.
{31:22} In my alarm I had said, “I am cut off from Your sight.” But You heard the sound of my pleading when I cried to You for help.
{31:23} Love the Lord, all His faithful ones. The Lord protects the loyal, but fully repays the arrogant.
{31:24} Be strong and courageous, all you who put your hope in the Lord.
{i32:1} The Joy of Forgiveness Davidic. A Maskil .
{32:1} How joyful is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered!
{32:2} How joyful is the man the Lord does not charge with sin and in whose spirit is no deceit!
{32:3} When I kept silent, my bones became brittle from my groaning all day long.
{32:4} For day and night Your hand was heavy on me; my strength was drained as in the summer’s heat. Selah
{32:5} Then I acknowledged my sin to You and did not conceal my iniquity. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,” and You took away the guilt of my sin. Selah
{32:6} Therefore let everyone who is faithful pray to You at a time that You may be found. When great floodwaters come, they will not reach him.
{32:7} You are my hiding place; You protect me from trouble. You surround me with joyful shouts of deliverance. Selah
{32:8} I will instruct you and show you the way to go; with My eye on you, I will give counsel.
{32:9} Do not be like a horse or mule, without understanding, that must be controlled with bit and bridle or else it will not come near you.
{32:10} Many pains come to the wicked, but the one who trusts in the Lord will have faithful love surrounding him.
{32:11} Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you righteous ones; shout for joy, all you upright in heart.
{i33:1} Praise to the Creator
{33:1} Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous ones; praise from the upright is beautiful.
{33:2} Praise the Lord with the lyre; make music to Him with a ten-stringed harp.
{33:3} Sing a new song to Him; play skillfully on the strings, with a joyful shout.
{33:4} For the word of the Lord is right, and all His work is trustworthy.
{33:5} He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the Lord’s unfailing love.
{33:6} The heavens were made by the word of the Lord, and all the stars, by the breath of His mouth.
{33:7} He gathers the waters of the sea into a heap; He puts the depths into storehouses.
{33:8} Let the whole earth tremble before the Lord; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.
{33:9} For He spoke, and it came into being; He commanded, and it came into existence.
{33:10} The Lord frustrates the counsel of the nations; He thwarts the plans of the peoples.
{33:11} The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of His heart from generation to generation.
{33:12} Happy is the nation whose God is Yahweh — the people He has chosen to be His own possession!
{33:13} The Lord looks down from heaven; He observes everyone.
{33:14} He gazes on all the inhabitants of the earth from His dwelling place.
{33:15} He alone shapes their hearts; He considers all their works.
{33:16} A king is not saved by a large army; a warrior will not be delivered by great strength.
{33:17} The horse is a false hope for safety; it provides no escape by its great power.
{33:18} Now the eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him — those who depend on His faithful love
{33:19} to deliver them from death and to keep them alive in famine.
{33:20} We wait for Yahweh; He is our help and shield.
{33:21} For our hearts rejoice in Him because we trust in His holy name.
{33:22} May Your faithful love rest on us, Yahweh, for we put our hope in You.
{i34:1} The Lord Delivers the Righteous Concerning David, when he pretended to be insane in the presence of Abimelech, Probably Achish, king of Gath  who drove him out, and he departed.
{34:1} I will praise the Lord at all times; His praise will always be on my lips.
{34:2} I will boast in the Lord; the humble will hear and be glad.
{34:3} Proclaim Yahweh’s greatness with me; let us exalt His name together.
{34:4} I sought the Lord, and He answered me and delivered me from all my fears.
{34:5} Those who look to Him are radiant with joy; their faces will never be ashamed.
{34:6} This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him and saved him from all his troubles.
{34:7} The Angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him, and rescues them.
{34:8} Taste and see that the Lord is good. How happy is the man who takes refuge in Him!
{34:9} You who are His holy ones, fear Yahweh, for those who fear Him lack nothing.
{34:10} Young lions lack food and go hungry, but those who seek the Lord will not lack any good thing.
{34:11} Come, children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
{34:12} Who is the man who delights in life, loving a long life to enjoy what is good?
{34:13} Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceitful speech.
{34:14} Turn away from evil and do what is good; seek peace and pursue it.
{34:15} The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their cry for help.
{34:16} The face of the Lord is set against those who do what is evil, to erase all memory of them from the earth.
{34:17} The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears, and delivers them from all their troubles.
{34:18} The Lord is near the brokenhearted; He saves those crushed in spirit.
{34:19} Many adversities come to the one who is righteous, but the Lord delivers him from them all.
{34:20} He protects all his bones; not one of them is broken.
{34:21} Evil brings death to the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be punished.
{34:22} The Lord redeems the life of His servants, and all who take refuge in Him will not be punished.
{i35:1} Prayer for Victory Davidic.
{35:1} Oppose my opponents, Lord; fight those who fight me.
{35:2} Take Your shields — large and small — and come to my aid.
{35:3} Draw the spear and javelin against my pursuers, and assure me: “I am your deliverance.”
{35:4} Let those who seek to kill me be disgraced and humiliated; let those who plan to harm me be turned back and ashamed.
{35:5} Let them be like chaff in the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them away.
{35:6} Let their way be dark and slippery, with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.
{35:7} They hid their net for me without cause; they dug a pit for me without cause.
{35:8} Let ruin come on him unexpectedly, and let the net that he hid ensnare him; let him fall into it — to his ruin.
{35:9} Then I will rejoice in the Lord; I will delight in His deliverance.
{35:10} My very bones will say, “Lord, who is like You, rescuing the poor from one too strong for him, the poor or the needy from one who robs him?”
{35:11} Malicious witnesses come forward; they question me about things I do not know.
{35:12} They repay me evil for good, making me desolate.
{35:13} Yet when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth; I humbled myself with fasting, and my prayer was genuine.
{35:14} I went about grieving as if for my friend or brother; I was bowed down with grief, like one mourning a mother.
{35:15} But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; they gathered against me. Assailants I did not know tore at me and did not stop.
{35:16} With godless mockery they gnashed their teeth at me.
{35:17} Lord, how long will You look on? Rescue my life from their ravages, my only one from the young lions.
{35:18} I will praise You in the great congregation; I will exalt You among many people.
{35:19} Do not let my deceitful enemies rejoice over me; do not let those who hate me without cause look at me maliciously.
{35:20} For they do not speak in friendly ways, but contrive deceitful schemes against those who live peacefully in the land.
{35:21} They open their mouths wide against me and say, “Aha, aha! We saw it!”
{35:22} You saw it, Lord; do not be silent. Lord, do not be far from me.
{35:23} Wake up and rise to my defense, to my cause, my God and my Lord!
{35:24} Vindicate me, Lord my God, in keeping with Your righteousness, and do not let them rejoice over me.
{35:25} Do not let them say in their hearts, “Aha! Just what we wanted.” Do not let them say, “We have swallowed him up!”
{35:26} Let those who rejoice at my misfortune be disgraced and humiliated; let those who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and reproach.
{35:27} Let those who want my vindication shout for joy and be glad; let them continually say, “The Lord be exalted. He takes pleasure in His servant’s well-being.”
{35:28} And my tongue will proclaim Your righteousness, Your praise all day long.
{i36:1} Human Wickedness and God’s Love For the choir director. A psalm of David, the Lord ’s servant.
{36:1} An oracle within my heart concerning the transgression of the wicked person: There is no dread of God before his eyes,
{36:2} for in his own eyes he flatters himself too much to discover and hate his sin.
{36:3} The words of his mouth are malicious and deceptive; he has stopped acting wisely and doing good.
{36:4} Even on his bed he makes malicious plans. He sets himself on a path that is not good and does not reject evil.
{36:5} Lord, Your faithful love reaches to heaven, Your faithfulness to the clouds.
{36:6} Your righteousness is like the highest mountains; Your judgments, like the deepest sea. Lord, You preserve man and beast.
{36:7} God, Your faithful love is so valuable that people take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.
{36:8} They are filled from the abundance of Your house; You let them drink from Your refreshing stream,
{36:9} for with You is life’s fountain. In Your light we will see light.
{36:10} Spread Your faithful love over those who know You, and Your righteousness over the upright in heart.
{36:11} Do not let the foot of the arrogant man come near me or the hand of the wicked one drive me away.
{36:12} There the evildoers fall; they have been thrown down and cannot rise.
{i37:1} Instruction in Wisdom Davidic.
{37:1} Do not be agitated by evildoers; do not envy those who do wrong.
{37:2} For they wither quickly like grass and wilt like tender green plants.
{37:3} Trust in the Lord and do what is good; dwell in the land and live securely.
{37:4} Take delight in the Lord, and He will give you your heart’s desires.
{37:5} Commit your way to the Lord; trust in Him, and He will act,
{37:6} making your righteousness shine like the dawn, your justice like the noonday.
{37:7} Be silent before the Lord and wait expectantly for Him; do not be agitated by one who prospers in his way, by the man who carries out evil plans.
{37:8} Refrain from anger and give up your rage; do not be agitated — it can only bring harm.
{37:9} For evildoers will be destroyed, but those who put their hope in the Lord will inherit the land.
{37:10} A little while, and the wicked person will be no more; though you look for him, he will not be there.
{37:11} But the humble will inherit the land and will enjoy abundant prosperity.
{37:12} The wicked person schemes against the righteous and gnashes his teeth at him.
{37:13} The Lord laughs at him because He sees that his day is coming.
{37:14} The wicked have drawn the sword and strung the bow to bring down the afflicted and needy and to slaughter those whose way is upright.
{37:15} Their swords will enter their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.
{37:16} The little that the righteous man has is better than the abundance of many wicked people.
{37:17} For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord supports the righteous.
{37:18} The Lord watches over the blameless all their days, and their inheritance will last forever.
{37:19} They will not be disgraced in times of adversity; they will be satisfied in days of hunger.
{37:20} But the wicked will perish; the Lord’s enemies, like the glory of the pastures, will fade away — they will fade away like smoke.
{37:21} The wicked man borrows and does not repay, but the righteous one is gracious and giving.
{37:22} Those who are blessed by Him will inherit the land, but those cursed by Him will be destroyed.
{37:23} A man’s steps are established by the Lord, and He takes pleasure in his way.
{37:24} Though he falls, he will not be overwhelmed, because the Lord holds his hand.
{37:25} I have been young and now I am old, yet I have not seen the righteous abandoned or his children begging for bread.
{37:26} He is always generous, always lending, and his children are a blessing.
{37:27} Turn away from evil and do what is good, and dwell there forever.
{37:28} For the Lord loves justice and will not abandon His faithful ones. They are kept safe forever, but the children of the wicked will be destroyed.
{37:29} The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it permanently.
{37:30} The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom; his tongue speaks what is just.
{37:31} The instruction of his God is in his heart; his steps do not falter.
{37:32} The wicked one lies in wait for the righteous and seeks to kill him;
{37:33} the Lord will not leave him in the power of the wicked one or allow him to be condemned when he is judged.
{37:34} Wait for the Lord and keep His way, and He will exalt you to inherit the land. You will watch when the wicked are destroyed.
{37:35} I have seen a wicked, violent man well-rooted like a flourishing native tree.
{37:36} Then I passed by and noticed he was gone; I searched for him, but he could not be found.
{37:37} Watch the blameless and observe the upright, for the man of peace will have a future.
{37:38} But transgressors will all be eliminated; the future of the wicked will be destroyed.
{37:39} The salvation of the righteous is from the Lord, their refuge in a time of distress.
{37:40} The Lord helps and delivers them; He will deliver them from the wicked and will save them because they take refuge in Him.
{i38:1} Prayer of a Suffering Sinner A Davidic psalm for remembrance.
{38:1} Lord, do not punish me in Your anger or discipline me in Your wrath.
{38:2} For Your arrows have sunk into me, and Your hand has pressed down on me.
{38:3} There is no health in my body because of Your indignation; there is no strength in my bones because of my sin.
{38:4} For my sins have flooded over my head; they are a burden too heavy for me to bear.
{38:5} My wounds are foul and festering because of my foolishness.
{38:6} I am bent over and brought low; all day long I go around in mourning.
{38:7} For my loins are full of burning pain, and there is no health in my body.
{38:8} I am faint and severely crushed; I groan because of the anguish of my heart.
{38:9} Lord, my every desire is known to You; my sighing is not hidden from You.
{38:10} My heart races, my strength leaves me, and even the light of my eyes has faded.
{38:11} My loved ones and friends stand back from my affliction, and my relatives stand at a distance.
{38:12} Those who seek my life set traps, and those who want to harm me threaten to destroy me; they plot treachery all day long.
{38:13} I am like a deaf person; I do not hear. I am like a speechless person who does not open his mouth.
{38:14} I am like a man who does not hear and has no arguments in his mouth.
{38:15} I put my hope in You, Lord; You will answer, Lord my God.
{38:16} For I said, “Don’t let them rejoice over me — those who are arrogant toward me when I stumble.”
{38:17} For I am about to fall, and my pain is constantly with me.
{38:18} So I confess my guilt; I am anxious because of my sin.
{38:19} But my enemies are vigorous and powerful; many hate me for no reason.
{38:20} Those who repay evil for good attack me for pursuing good.
{38:21} Lord, do not abandon me; my God, do not be far from me.
{38:22} Hurry to help me, Lord, my Savior.
{i39:1} The Fleeting Nature of Life For the choir director, for Jeduthun. A Davidic psalm.
{39:1} I said, “I will guard my ways so that I may not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth with a muzzle as long as the wicked are in my presence.”
{39:2} I was speechless and quiet; I kept silent, even from speaking good, and my pain intensified.
{39:3} My heart grew hot within me; as I mused, a fire burned. I spoke with my tongue:
{39:4} “Lord, reveal to me the end of my life and the number of my days. Let me know how short-lived I am.
{39:5} You, indeed, have made my days short in length, and my life span as nothing in Your sight. Yes, every mortal man is only a vapor. Selah
{39:6} “Certainly, man walks about like a mere shadow. Indeed, they frantically rush around in vain, gathering possessions without knowing who will get them.
{39:7} Now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in You.
{39:8} Deliver me from all my transgressions; do not make me the taunt of fools.
{39:9} I am speechless; I do not open my mouth because of what You have done.
{39:10} Remove Your torment from me; I fade away because of the force of Your hand.
{39:11} You discipline a man with punishment for sin, consuming like a moth what is precious to him; every man is only a vapor. Selah
{39:12} “Hear my prayer, Lord, and listen to my cry for help; do not be silent at my tears. For I am a foreigner residing with You, a temporary resident like all my fathers.
{39:13} Turn Your angry gaze from me so that I may be cheered up before I die and am gone.”
{i40:1} Thanksgiving and a Cry for Help For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.
{40:1} I waited patiently for the Lord, and He turned to me and heard my cry for help.
{40:2} He brought me up from a desolate pit, out of the muddy clay, and set my feet on a rock, making my steps secure.
{40:3} He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.
{40:4} How happy is the man who has put his trust in the Lord and has not turned to the proud or to those who run after lies!
{40:5} Lord my God, You have done many things — Your wonderful works and Your plans for us; none can compare with You. If I were to report and speak of them, they are more than can be told.
{40:6} You do not delight in sacrifice and offering; You open my ears to listen. You do not ask for a whole burnt offering or a sin offering.
{40:7} Then I said, “See, I have come; it is written about me in the volume of the scroll.
{40:8} I delight to do Your will, my God; Your instruction lives within me.”
{40:9} I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly; see, I do not keep my mouth closed — as You know, Lord.
{40:10} I did not hide Your righteousness in my heart; I spoke about Your faithfulness and salvation; I did not conceal Your constant love and truth from the great assembly.
{40:11} Lord, do not withhold Your compassion from me; Your constant love and truth will always guard me.
{40:12} For troubles without number have surrounded me; my sins have overtaken me; I am unable to see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my courage leaves me.
{40:13} Lord, be pleased to deliver me; hurry to help me, Lord.
{40:14} Let those who seek to take my life be disgraced and confounded. Let those who wish me harm be driven back and humiliated.
{40:15} Let those who say to me, “Aha, aha!” be horrified because of their shame.
{40:16} Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; let those who love Your salvation continually say, “The Lord is great!”
{40:17} I am afflicted and needy; the Lord thinks of me. You are my helper and my deliverer; my God, do not delay.
{i41:1} Victory in Spite of Betrayal For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.
{41:1} Happy is one who cares for the poor; the Lord will save him in a day of adversity.
{41:2} The Lord will keep him and preserve him; he will be blessed in the land. You will not give him over to the desire of his enemies.
{41:3} The Lord will sustain him on his sickbed; You will heal him on the bed where he lies.
{41:4} I said, “Lord, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against You.”
{41:5} My enemies speak maliciously about me: “When will he die and be forgotten?”
{41:6} When one of them comes to visit, he speaks deceitfully; he stores up evil in his heart; he goes out and talks.
{41:7} All who hate me whisper together about me; they plan to harm me.
{41:8} “Lethal poison has been poured into him, and he won’t rise again from where he lies!”
{41:9} Even my friend in whom I trusted, one who ate my bread, has raised his heel against me.
{41:10} But You, Lord, be gracious to me and raise me up; then I will repay them.
{41:11} By this I know that You delight in me: my enemy does not shout in triumph over me.
{41:12} You supported me because of my integrity and set me in Your presence forever.
{41:13} May Yahweh, the God of Israel, be praised from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and amen.
{i42:1} BOOK II (Psalms 42–72) Longing for God For the choir director. A Maskil of the sons of Korah.
{42:1} As a deer longs for streams of water, so I long for You, God.
{42:2} I thirst for God, the living God. When can I come and appear before God?
{42:3} My tears have been my food day and night, while all day long people say to me, “Where is your God?”
{42:4} I remember this as I pour out my heart: how I walked with many, leading the festive procession to the house of God, with joyful and thankful shouts.
{42:5} Why am I so depressed? Why this turmoil within me? Put your hope in God, for I will still praise Him, my Savior and my God.
{42:6} I am deeply depressed; therefore I remember You from the land of Jordan and the peaks of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
{42:7} Deep calls to deep in the roar of Your waterfalls; all Your breakers and Your billows have swept over me.
{42:8} The Lord will send His faithful love by day; His song will be with me in the night — a prayer to the God of my life.
{42:9} I will say to God, my rock, “Why have You forgotten me? Why must I go about in sorrow because of the enemy’s oppression?”
{42:10} My adversaries taunt me, as if crushing my bones, while all day long they say to me, “Where is your God?”
{42:11} Why am I so depressed? Why this turmoil within me? Put your hope in God, for I will still praise Him, my Savior and my God.
{43:1} Vindicate me, God, and defend my cause against an ungodly nation; rescue me from the deceitful and unjust man.
{43:2} For You are the God of my refuge. Why have You rejected me? Why must I go about in sorrow because of the enemy’s oppression?
{43:3} Send Your light and Your truth; let them lead me. Let them bring me to Your holy mountain, to Your dwelling place.
{43:4} Then I will come to the altar of God, to God, my greatest joy. I will praise You with the lyre, God, my God.
{43:5} Why am I so depressed? Why this turmoil within me? Put your hope in God, for I will still praise Him, my Savior and my God.
{i44:1} Israel’s Complaint For the choir director. A Maskil of the sons of Korah.
{44:1} God, we have heard with our ears — our ancestors have told us — the work You accomplished in their days, in days long ago:
{44:2} to plant them, You drove out the nations with Your hand; to settle them, You crushed the peoples.
{44:3} For they did not take the land by their sword — their arm did not bring them victory — but by Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your face, for You were pleased with them.
{44:4} You are my King, my God, who ordains victories for Jacob.
{44:5} Through You we drive back our foes; through Your name we trample our enemies.
{44:6} For I do not trust in my bow, and my sword does not bring me victory.
{44:7} But You give us victory over our foes and let those who hate us be disgraced.
{44:8} We boast in God all day long; we will praise Your name forever. Selah
{44:9} But You have rejected and humiliated us; You do not march out with our armies.
{44:10} You make us retreat from the foe, and those who hate us have taken plunder for themselves.
{44:11} You hand us over to be eaten like sheep and scatter us among the nations.
{44:12} You sell Your people for nothing; You make no profit from selling them.
{44:13} You make us an object of reproach to our neighbors, a source of mockery and ridicule to those around us.
{44:14} You make us a joke among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples.
{44:15} My disgrace is before me all day long, and shame has covered my face,
{44:16} because of the voice of the scorner and reviler, because of the enemy and avenger.
{44:17} All this has happened to us, but we have not forgotten You or betrayed Your covenant.
{44:18} Our hearts have not turned back; our steps have not strayed from Your path.
{44:19} But You have crushed us in a haunt of jackals and have covered us with deepest darkness.
{44:20} If we had forgotten the name of our God and spread out our hands to a foreign god,
{44:21} wouldn’t God have found this out, since He knows the secrets of the heart?
{44:22} Because of You we are slain all day long; we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered.
{44:23} Wake up, Lord! Why are You sleeping? Get up! Don’t reject us forever!
{44:24} Why do You hide Yourself and forget our affliction and oppression?
{44:25} For we have sunk down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.
{44:26} Rise up! Help us! Redeem us because of Your faithful love.
{i45:1} A Royal Wedding Song For the choir director: according to “The Lilies.” Possibly a tune; Pss 60; 69; 80 A Maskil of the sons of Korah. A love song.
{45:1} My heart is moved by a noble theme as I recite my verses to the king; my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.
{45:2} You are the most handsome of men; grace flows from your lips. Therefore God has blessed you forever.
{45:3} Mighty warrior, strap your sword at your side. In your majesty and splendor —
{45:4} in your splendor ride triumphantly in the cause of truth, humility, and justice. May your right hand show your awe-inspiring acts.
{45:5} Your arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s enemies; the peoples fall under you.
{45:6} Your throne, God, is forever and ever; the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of justice.
{45:7} You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy more than your companions.
{45:8} Myrrh, aloes, and cassia perfume all your garments; from ivory palaces harps bring you joy.
{45:9} Kings’ daughters are among your honored women; the queen, adorned with gold from Ophir, stands at your right hand.
{45:10} Listen, daughter, pay attention and consider: forget your people and your father’s house,
{45:11} and the king will desire your beauty. Bow down to him, for he is your lord.
{45:12} The daughter of Tyre, the wealthy people, will seek your favor with gifts.
{45:13} In her chamber, the royal daughter is all glorious, her clothing embroidered with gold.
{45:14} In colorful garments she is led to the king; after her, the virgins, her companions, are brought to you.
{45:15} They are led in with gladness and rejoicing; they enter the king’s palace.
{45:16} Your sons will succeed your ancestors; you will make them princes throughout the land.
{45:17} I will cause your name to be remembered for all generations; therefore the peoples will praise you forever and ever.
{i46:1} God Our Refuge For the choir director. A song of the sons of Korah. According to Alamoth . This may refer to a high pitch, perhaps a tune sung by soprano voices; the Hb word means “young women.”
{46:1} God is our refuge and strength, a helper who is always found in times of trouble.
{46:2} Therefore we will not be afraid, though the earth trembles and the mountains topple into the depths of the seas,
{46:3} though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with its turmoil. Selah
{46:4} There is a river — its streams delight the city of God, the holy dwelling place of the Most High.
{46:5} God is within her; she will not be toppled. God will help her when the morning dawns.
{46:6} Nations rage, kingdoms topple; the earth melts when He lifts His voice.
{46:7} The Lord of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah
{46:8} Come, see the works of the Lord, who brings devastation on the earth.
{46:9} He makes wars cease throughout the earth. He shatters bows and cuts spears to pieces; He burns up the chariots.
{46:10} “Stop your fighting — and know that I am God, exalted among the nations, exalted on the earth.”
{46:11} Yahweh of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah
{i47:1} God Our King For the choir director. A psalm of the sons of Korah.
{47:1} Clap your hands, all you peoples; shout to God with a jubilant cry.
{47:2} For Yahweh, the Most High, is awe-inspiring, a great King over all the earth.
{47:3} He subdues peoples under us and nations under our feet.
{47:4} He chooses for us our inheritance — the pride of Jacob, whom He loves. Selah
{47:5} God ascends among shouts of joy, the Lord, among the sound of trumpets.
{47:6} Sing praise to God, sing praise; sing praise to our King, sing praise!
{47:7} Sing a song of wisdom, for God is King of all the earth.
{47:8} God reigns over the nations; God is seated on His holy throne.
{47:9} The nobles of the peoples have assembled with the people of the God of Abraham. For the leaders of the earth belong to God; He is greatly exalted.
{i48:1} Zion Exalted A song. A psalm of the sons of Korah.
{48:1} The Lord is great and highly praised in the city of our God. His holy mountain,
{48:2} rising splendidly, is the joy of the whole earth. Mount Zion on the slopes of the north is the city of the great King.
{48:3} God is known as a stronghold in its citadels.
{48:4} Look! The kings assembled; they advanced together.
{48:5} They looked and froze with fear; they fled in terror.
{48:6} Trembling seized them there, agony like that of a woman in labor,
{48:7} as You wrecked the ships of Tarshish with the east wind.
{48:8} Just as we heard, so we have seen in the city of Yahweh of Hosts, in the city of our God; God will establish it forever. Selah
{48:9} God, within Your temple, we contemplate Your faithful love.
{48:10} Your name, God, like Your praise, reaches to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is filled with justice.
{48:11} Mount Zion is glad. The towns of Judah rejoice because of Your judgments.
{48:12} Go around Zion, encircle it; count its towers,
{48:13} note its ramparts; tour its citadels so that you can tell a future generation:
{48:14} “This God, our God forever and ever — He will always lead us.”
{i49:1} Misplaced Trust in Wealth For the choir director. A psalm of the sons of Korah.
{49:1} Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who inhabit the world,
{49:2} both low and high, rich and poor together.
{49:3} My mouth speaks wisdom; my heart’s meditation brings understanding.
{49:4} I turn my ear to a proverb; I explain my riddle with a lyre.
{49:5} Why should I fear in times of trouble? The iniquity of my foes surrounds me.
{49:6} They trust in their wealth and boast of their abundant riches.
{49:7} Yet these cannot redeem a person or pay his ransom to God —
{49:8} since the price of redeeming him is too costly, one should forever stop trying —
{49:9} so that he may live forever and not see the Pit.
{49:10} For one can see that wise men die; foolish and stupid men also pass away. Then they leave their wealth to others.
{49:11} Their graves are their eternal homes, their homes from generation to generation, though they have named estates after themselves.
{49:12} But despite his assets, man will not last; he is like the animals that perish.
{49:13} This is the way of those who are arrogant, and of their followers, who approve of their words. Selah
{49:14} Like sheep they are headed for Sheol; Death will shepherd them. The upright will rule over them in the morning, and their form will waste away in Sheol, far from their lofty abode.
{49:15} But God will redeem my life from the power of Sheol, for He will take me. Selah
{49:16} Do not be afraid when a man gets rich, when the wealth of his house increases.
{49:17} For when he dies, he will take nothing at all; his wealth will not follow him down.
{49:18} Though he praises himself during his lifetime — and people praise you when you do well for yourself —
{49:19} he will go to the generation of his fathers; they will never see the light.
{49:20} A man with valuable possessions but without understanding is like the animals that perish.
{i50:1} God as Judge A psalm of Asaph.
{50:1} Yahweh, the God of gods speaks; He summons the earth from east to west.
{50:2} From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God appears in radiance.
{50:3} Our God is coming; He will not be silent! Devouring fire precedes Him, and a storm rages around Him.
{50:4} On high, He summons heaven and earth in order to judge His people.
{50:5} “Gather My faithful ones to Me, those who made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.”
{50:6} The heavens proclaim His righteousness, for God is the Judge. Selah
{50:7} “Listen, My people, and I will speak; I will testify against you, Israel. I am God, your God.
{50:8} I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices or for your burnt offerings, which are continually before Me.
{50:9} I will not accept a bull from your household or male goats from your pens,
{50:10} for every animal of the forest is Mine, the cattle on a thousand hills.
{50:11} I know every bird of the mountains, and the creatures of the field are Mine.
{50:12} If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and everything in it is Mine.
{50:13} Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?
{50:14} Sacrifice a thank offering to God, and pay your vows to the Most High.
{50:15} Call on Me in a day of trouble; I will rescue you, and you will honor Me.”
{50:16} But God says to the wicked: “What right do you have to recite My statutes and to take My covenant on your lips?
{50:17} You hate instruction and turn your back on My words.
{50:18} When you see a thief, you make friends with him, and you associate with adulterers.
{50:19} You unleash your mouth for evil and harness your tongue for deceit.
{50:20} You sit, maligning your brother, slandering your mother’s son.
{50:21} You have done these things, and I kept silent; you thought I was just like you. But I will rebuke you and lay out the case before you.
{50:22} “Understand this, you who forget God, or I will tear you apart, and there will be no one to rescue you.
{50:23} Whoever sacrifices a thank offering honors Me, and whoever orders his conduct, I will show him the salvation of God.”
{i51:1} A Prayer for Restoration For the choir director. A Davidic psalm, when Nathan the prophet came to him after he had gone to Bathsheba.
{51:1} Be gracious to me, God, according to Your faithful love; according to Your abundant compassion, blot out my rebellion.
{51:2} Wash away my guilt and cleanse me from my sin.
{51:3} For I am conscious of my rebellion, and my sin is always before me.
{51:4} Against You — You alone — I have sinned and done this evil in Your sight. So You are right when You pass sentence; You are blameless when You judge.
{51:5} Indeed, I was guilty when I was born; I was sinful when my mother conceived me.
{51:6} Surely You desire integrity in the inner self, and You teach me wisdom deep within.
{51:7} Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
{51:8} Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones You have crushed rejoice.
{51:9} Turn Your face away from my sins and blot out all my guilt.
{51:10} God, create a clean heart for me and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
{51:11} Do not banish me from Your presence or take Your Holy Spirit from me.
{51:12} Restore the joy of Your salvation to me, and give me a willing spirit.
{51:13} Then I will teach the rebellious Your ways, and sinners will return to You.
{51:14} Save me from the guilt of bloodshed, God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing of Your righteousness.
{51:15} Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise.
{51:16} You do not want a sacrifice, or I would give it; You are not pleased with a burnt offering.
{51:17} The sacrifice pleasing to God is a broken spirit. God, You will not despise a broken and humbled heart.
{51:18} In Your good pleasure, cause Zion to prosper; build the walls of Jerusalem.
{51:19} Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices, whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on Your altar.
{i52:1} God Judges the Proud For the choir director. A Davidic Maskil . When Doeg the Edomite went and reported to Saul, telling him, “David went to Ahimelech’s house.”
{52:1} Why brag about evil, you hero! God’s faithful love is constant.
{52:2} Like a sharpened razor, your tongue devises destruction, working treachery.
{52:3} You love evil instead of good, lying instead of speaking truthfully. Selah
{52:4} You love any words that destroy, you treacherous tongue!
{52:5} This is why God will bring you down forever. He will take you, ripping you out of your tent; He will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah
{52:6} The righteous will look on with awe and will ridicule him:
{52:7} “Here is the man who would not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, taking refuge in his destructive behavior.”
{52:8} But I am like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God; I trust in God’s faithful love forever and ever.
{52:9} I will praise You forever for what You have done. In the presence of Your faithful people, I will put my hope in Your name, for it is good.
{i53:1} A Portrait of Sinners For the choir director: on Mahalath . Perhaps a tune, a musical instrument, or a dance; this may be related to Hb word for “sickness.”  A Davidic Maskil .
{53:1} The fool says in his heart, “God does not exist.” They are corrupt, and they do vile deeds. There is no one who does good.
{53:2} God looks down from heaven on the human race to see if there is one who is wise, one who seeks God.
{53:3} All have turned away; all alike have become corrupt. There is no one who does good, not even one.
{53:4} Will evildoers never understand? They consume My people as they consume bread; they do not call on God.
{53:5} Then they will be filled with terror — terror like no other — because God will scatter the bones of those who besiege you. You will put them to shame, for God has rejected them.
{53:6} Oh, that Israel’s deliverance would come from Zion! When God restores the fortunes of His people, Jacob will rejoice; Israel will be glad.
{i54:1} Prayer for Deliverance For the choir director: with stringed instruments. A Davidic Maskil . When the Ziphites went and said to Saul, “Is David not hiding among us? ”
{54:1} God, save me by Your name, and vindicate me by Your might!
{54:2} God, hear my prayer; listen to the words of my mouth.
{54:3} For strangers rise up against me, and violent men seek my life. They have no regard for God. Selah
{54:4} God is my helper; the Lord is the sustainer of my life.
{54:5} He will repay my adversaries for their evil. Because of Your faithfulness, annihilate them.
{54:6} I will sacrifice a freewill offering to You. I will praise Your name, Yahweh, because it is good.
{54:7} For He has delivered me from every trouble, and my eye has looked down on my enemies.
{i55:1} Betrayal by a Friend For the choir director: with stringed instruments. A Davidic Maskil .
{55:1} God, listen to my prayer and do not ignore my plea for help.
{55:2} Pay attention to me and answer me. I am restless and in turmoil with my complaint,
{55:3} because of the enemy’s voice, because of the pressure of the wicked. For they bring down disaster on me and harass me in anger.
{55:4} My heart shudders within me; terrors of death sweep over me.
{55:5} Fear and trembling grip me; horror has overwhelmed me.
{55:6} I said, “If only I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and find rest.
{55:7} How far away I would flee; I would stay in the wilderness. Selah
{55:8} I would hurry to my shelter from the raging wind and the storm.”
{55:9} Lord, confuse and confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city;
{55:10} day and night they make the rounds on its walls. Crime and trouble are within it;
{55:11} destruction is inside it; oppression and deceit never leave its marketplace.
{55:12} Now it is not an enemy who insults me — otherwise I could bear it; it is not a foe who rises up against me — otherwise I could hide from him.
{55:13} But it is you, a man who is my peer, my companion and good friend!
{55:14} We used to have close fellowship; we walked with the crowd into the house of God.
{55:15} Let death take them by surprise; let them go down to Sheol alive, because evil is in their homes and within them.
{55:16} But I call to God, and the Lord will save me.
{55:17} I complain and groan morning, noon, and night, and He hears my voice.
{55:18} Though many are against me, He will redeem me from my battle unharmed.
{55:19} God, the One enthroned from long ago, will hear and will humiliate them Selah because they do not change and do not fear God.
{55:20} My friend acts violently against those at peace with him; he violates his covenant.
{55:21} His buttery words are smooth, but war is in his heart. His words are softer than oil, but they are drawn swords.
{55:22} Cast your burden on the Lord, and He will sustain you; He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.
{55:23} God, You will bring them down to the Pit of destruction; men of bloodshed and treachery will not live out half their days. But I will trust in You.
{i56:1} A Call for God’s Protection For the choir director: according to “A Silent Dove Far Away.” Possibly a tune A Davidic Miktam . When the Philistines seized him in Gath.
{56:1} Be gracious to me, God, for man tramples me; he fights and oppresses me all day long.
{56:2} My adversaries trample me all day, for many arrogantly fight against me.
{56:3} When I am afraid, I will trust in You.
{56:4} In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I will not fear. What can man do to me?
{56:5} They twist my words all day long; all their thoughts against me are evil.
{56:6} They stir up strife, they lurk; they watch my steps while they wait to take my life.
{56:7} Will they escape in spite of such sin? God, bring down the nations in wrath.
{56:8} You Yourself have recorded my wanderings. Put my tears in Your bottle. Are they not in Your records?
{56:9} Then my enemies will retreat on the day when I call. This I know: God is for me.
{56:10} In God, whose word I praise, in the Lord, whose word I praise,
{56:11} in God I trust; I will not fear. What can man do to me?
{56:12} I am obligated by vows to You, God; I will make my thank offerings to You.
{56:13} For You delivered me from death, even my feet from stumbling, to walk before God in the light of life.
{i57:1} Praise for God’s Protection For the choir director: “Do Not Destroy.” Possibly a tune A Davidic Miktam . When he fled before Saul into the cave.
{57:1} Be gracious to me, God, be gracious to me, for I take refuge in You. I will seek refuge in the shadow of Your wings until danger passes.
{57:2} I call to God Most High, to God who fulfills His purpose for me.
{57:3} He reaches down from heaven and saves me, challenging the one who tramples me. Selah God sends His faithful love and truth.
{57:4} I am surrounded by lions; I lie down with those who devour men. Their teeth are spears and arrows; their tongues are sharp swords.
{57:5} God, be exalted above the heavens; let Your glory be over the whole earth.
{57:6} They prepared a net for my steps; I was despondent. They dug a pit ahead of me, but they fell into it! Selah
{57:7} My heart is confident, God, my heart is confident. I will sing; I will sing praises.
{57:8} Wake up, my soul! Wake up, harp and lyre! I will wake up the dawn.
{57:9} I will praise You, Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to You among the nations.
{57:10} For Your faithful love is as high as the heavens; Your faithfulness reaches the clouds.
{57:11} God, be exalted above the heavens; let Your glory be over the whole earth.
{i58:1} A Cry against Injustice For the choir director: “Do Not Destroy.” Possibly a tune A Davidic Miktam .
{58:1} Do you really speak righteously, you mighty ones? Do you judge people fairly?
{58:2} No, you practice injustice in your hearts; with your hands you weigh out violence in the land.
{58:3} The wicked go astray from the womb; liars err from birth.
{58:4} They have venom like the venom of a snake, like the deaf cobra that stops up its ears,
{58:5} that does not listen to the sound of the charmers who skillfully weave spells.
{58:6} God, knock the teeth out of their mouths; Lord, tear out the young lions’ fangs.
{58:7} They will vanish like water that flows by; they will aim their useless arrows.
{58:8} Like a slug that moves along in slime, like a woman’s miscarried child, they will not see the sun.
{58:9} Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns — whether green or burning — He will sweep them away.
{58:10} The righteous one will rejoice when he sees the retribution; he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
{58:11} Then people will say, “Yes, there is a reward for the righteous! There is a God who judges on earth!”
{i59:1} God Our Stronghold For the choir director: “Do Not Destroy.” Possibly a tune A Davidic Miktam . When Saul sent agents to watch the house and kill him.
{59:1} Deliver me from my enemies, my God; protect me from those who rise up against me.
{59:2} Deliver me from those who practice sin, and save me from men of bloodshed.
{59:3} Lord, look! They set an ambush for me. Powerful men attack me, but not because of any sin or rebellion of mine.
{59:4} For no fault of mine, they run and take up a position. Awake to help me, and take notice.
{59:5} Lord God of Hosts, You are the God of Israel, rise up to punish all the nations; do not show grace to any wicked traitors. Selah
{59:6} They return at evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city.
{59:7} Look, they spew from their mouths — sharp words from their lips. “For who,” they say, “will hear?”
{59:8} But You laugh at them, Lord; You ridicule all the nations.
{59:9} I will keep watch for You, my strength, because God is my stronghold.
{59:10} My faithful God will come to meet me; God will let me look down on my adversaries.
{59:11} Do not kill them; otherwise, my people will forget. By Your power, make them homeless wanderers and bring them down, Lord, our shield.
{59:12} For the sin of their mouths and the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride. They utter curses and lies.
{59:13} Consume them in rage; consume them until they are gone. Then people will know throughout the earth that God rules over Jacob. Selah
{59:14} And they return at evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city.
{59:15} They scavenge for food; they growl if they are not satisfied.
{59:16} But I will sing of Your strength and will joyfully proclaim Your faithful love in the morning. For You have been a stronghold for me, a refuge in my day of trouble.
{59:17} To You, my strength, I sing praises, because God is my stronghold — my faithful God.
{i60:1} Prayer in Difficult Times For the choir director: according to “The Lily of Testimony.” Possibly a tune; Pss 45; 69; 80 A Davidic Miktam for teaching. When he fought with Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and struck Edom in the Valley of Salt, killing 12,000.
{60:1} God, You have rejected us; You have broken out against us; You have been angry. Restore us!
{60:2} You have shaken the land and split it open. Heal its fissures, for it shudders.
{60:3} You have made Your people suffer hardship; You have given us wine to drink that made us stagger.
{60:4} You have given a signal flag to those who fear You, so that they can flee before the archers. Selah
{60:5} Save with Your right hand, and answer me, so that those You love may be rescued.
{60:6} God has spoken in His sanctuary: “I will triumph! I will divide up Shechem. I will apportion the Valley of Succoth.
{60:7} Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine, and Ephraim is My helmet; Judah is My scepter.
{60:8} Moab is My washbasin. I throw My sandal on Edom; I shout in triumph over Philistia.”
{60:9} Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
{60:10} God, haven’t You rejected us? God, You do not march out with our armies.
{60:11} Give us aid against the foe, for human help is worthless.
{60:12} With God we will perform valiantly; He will trample our foes.
{i61:1} Security in God For the choir director: on stringed instruments. Davidic.
{61:1} God, hear my cry; pay attention to my prayer.
{61:2} I call to You from the ends of the earth when my heart is without strength. Lead me to a rock that is high above me,
{61:3} for You have been a refuge for me, a strong tower in the face of the enemy.
{61:4} I will live in Your tent forever and take refuge under the shelter of Your wings. Selah
{61:5} God, You have heard my vows; You have given a heritage to those who fear Your name.
{61:6} Add days to the king’s life; may his years span many generations.
{61:7} May he sit enthroned before God forever; appoint faithful love and truth to guard him.
{61:8} Then I will continually sing of Your name, fulfilling my vows day by day.
{i62:1} Trust in God Alone For the choir director: according to Jeduthun. A Davidic psalm.
{62:1} I am at rest in God alone; my salvation comes from Him.
{62:2} He alone is my rock and my salvation, my stronghold; I will never be shaken.
{62:3} How long will you threaten a man? Will all of you attack as if he were a leaning wall or a tottering stone fence?
{62:4} They only plan to bring him down from his high position. They take pleasure in lying; they bless with their mouths, but they curse inwardly. Selah
{62:5} Rest in God alone, my soul, for my hope comes from Him.
{62:6} He alone is my rock and my salvation, my stronghold; I will not be shaken.
{62:7} My salvation and glory depend on God, my strong rock. My refuge is in God.
{62:8} Trust in Him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts before Him. God is our refuge. Selah
{62:9} Men are only a vapor; exalted men, an illusion. Weighed in the scales, they go up; together they are less than a vapor.
{62:10} Place no trust in oppression, or false hope in robbery. If wealth increases, pay no attention to it.
{62:11} God has spoken once; I have heard this twice: strength belongs to God,
{62:12} and faithful love belongs to You, Lord. For You repay each according to his works.
{i63:1} Praise God Who Satisfies A Davidic psalm. When he was in the Wilderness of Judah.
{63:1} God, You are my God; I eagerly seek You. I thirst for You; my body faints for You in a land that is dry, desolate, and without water.
{63:2} So I gaze on You in the sanctuary to see Your strength and Your glory.
{63:3} My lips will glorify You because Your faithful love is better than life.
{63:4} So I will praise You as long as I live; at Your name, I will lift up my hands.
{63:5} You satisfy me as with rich food; my mouth will praise You with joyful lips.
{63:6} When I think of You as I lie on my bed, I meditate on You during the night watches
{63:7} because You are my helper; I will rejoice in the shadow of Your wings.
{63:8} I follow close to You; Your right hand holds on to me.
{63:9} But those who seek to destroy my life will go into the depths of the earth.
{63:10} They will be given over to the power of the sword; they will become the jackals’ prey.
{63:11} But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by Him will boast, for the mouths of liars will be shut.
{i64:1} Protection from Evildoers For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.
{64:1} God, hear my voice when I complain. Protect my life from the terror of the enemy.
{64:2} Hide me from the scheming of wicked people, from the mob of evildoers,
{64:3} who sharpen their tongues like swords and aim bitter words like arrows,
{64:4} shooting from concealed places at the innocent. They shoot at him suddenly and are not afraid.
{64:5} They encourage each other in an evil plan; they talk about hiding traps and say, “Who will see them?”
{64:6} They devise crimes and say, “We have perfected a secret plan.” The inner man and the heart are mysterious.
{64:7} But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly, they will be wounded.
{64:8} They will be made to stumble; their own tongues work against them. All who see them will shake their heads.
{64:9} Then everyone will fear and will tell about God’s work, for they will understand what He has done.
{64:10} The righteous one rejoices in the Lord and takes refuge in Him; all those who are upright in heart will offer praise.
{i65:1} God’s Care for the Earth For the choir director. A Davidic psalm. A song.
{65:1} Praise is rightfully Yours, God, in Zion; vows to You will be fulfilled.
{65:2} All humanity will come to You, the One who hears prayer.
{65:3} Iniquities overwhelm me; only You can atone for our rebellions.
{65:4} How happy is the one You choose and bring near to live in Your courts! We will be satisfied with the goodness of Your house, the holiness of Your temple.
{65:5} You answer us in righteousness, with awe-inspiring works, God of our salvation, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the distant seas.
{65:6} You establish the mountains by Your power, robed with strength.
{65:7} You silence the roar of the seas, the roar of their waves, and the tumult of the nations.
{65:8} Those who live far away are awed by Your signs; You make east and west shout for joy.
{65:9} You visit the earth and water it abundantly, enriching it greatly. God’s stream is filled with water, for You prepare the earth in this way, providing people with grain.
{65:10} You soften it with showers and bless its growth, soaking its furrows and leveling its ridges.
{65:11} You crown the year with Your goodness; Your ways overflow with plenty.
{65:12} The wilderness pastures overflow, and the hills are robed with joy.
{65:13} The pastures are clothed with flocks and the valleys covered with grain. They shout in triumph; indeed, they sing.
{i66:1} Praise for God’s Mighty Acts For the choir director. A song. A psalm.
{66:1} Shout joyfully to God, all the earth!
{66:2} Sing about the glory of His name; make His praise glorious.
{66:3} Say to God, “How awe-inspiring are Your works! Your enemies will cringe before You because of Your great strength.
{66:4} All the earth will worship You and sing praise to You. They will sing praise to Your name.” Selah
{66:5} Come and see the wonders of God; His acts for humanity are awe-inspiring.
{66:6} He turned the sea into dry land, and they crossed the river on foot. There we rejoiced in Him.
{66:7} He rules forever by His might; He keeps His eye on the nations. The rebellious should not exalt themselves. Selah
{66:8} Praise our God, you peoples; let the sound of His praise be heard.
{66:9} He keeps us alive and does not allow our feet to slip.
{66:10} For You, God, tested us; You refined us as silver is refined.
{66:11} You lured us into a trap; You placed burdens on our backs.
{66:12} You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but You brought us out to abundance.
{66:13} I will enter Your house with burnt offerings; I will pay You my vows
{66:14} that my lips promised and my mouth spoke during my distress.
{66:15} I will offer You fattened sheep as burnt offerings, with the fragrant smoke of rams; I will sacrifice oxen with goats. Selah
{66:16} Come and listen, all who fear God, and I will tell what He has done for me.
{66:17} I cried out to Him with my mouth, and praise was on my tongue.
{66:18} If I had been aware of malice in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.
{66:19} However, God has listened; He has paid attention to the sound of my prayer.
{66:20} May God be praised! He has not turned away my prayer or turned His faithful love from me.
{i67:1} All Will Praise God For the choir director: with stringed instruments. A psalm. A song.
{67:1} May God be gracious to us and bless us; look on us with favor Selah
{67:2} so that Your way may be known on earth, Your salvation among all nations.
{67:3} Let the peoples praise You, God; let all the peoples praise You.
{67:4} Let the nations rejoice and shout for joy, for You judge the peoples with fairness and lead the nations on earth. Selah
{67:5} Let the peoples praise You, God, let all the peoples praise You.
{67:6} The earth has produced its harvest; God, our God, blesses us.
{67:7} God will bless us, and all the ends of the earth will fear Him.
{i68:1} God’s Majestic Power For the choir director. A Davidic psalm. A song.
{68:1} God arises. His enemies scatter, and those who hate Him flee from His presence.
{68:2} As smoke is blown away, so You blow them away. As wax melts before the fire, so the wicked are destroyed before God.
{68:3} But the righteous are glad; they rejoice before God and celebrate with joy.
{68:4} Sing to God! Sing praises to His name. Exalt Him who rides on the clouds — His name is Yahweh — and rejoice before Him.
{68:5} God in His holy dwelling is a father of the fatherless and a champion of widows.
{68:6} God provides homes for those who are deserted. He leads out the prisoners to prosperity, but the rebellious live in a scorched land.
{68:7} God, when You went out before Your people, when You marched through the desert, Selah
{68:8} the earth trembled and the skies poured down rain before God, the God of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.
{68:9} You, God, showered abundant rain; You revived Your inheritance when it languished.
{68:10} Your people settled in it; God, You provided for the poor by Your goodness.
{68:11} The Lord gave the command; a great company of women brought the good news:
{68:12} “The kings of the armies flee — they flee!” She who stays at home divides the spoil.
{68:13} While you lie among the sheepfolds, the wings of a dove are covered with silver, and its feathers with glistening gold.
{68:14} When the Almighty scattered kings in the land, it snowed on Zalmon.
{68:15} Mount Bashan is God’s towering mountain; Mount Bashan is a mountain of many peaks.
{68:16} Why gaze with envy, you mountain peaks, at the mountain God desired for His dwelling? The Lord will live there forever!
{68:17} God’s chariots are tens of thousands, thousands and thousands; the Lord is among them in the sanctuary as He was at Sinai.
{68:18} You ascended to the heights, taking away captives; You received gifts from people, even from the rebellious, so that the Lord God might live there.
{68:19} May the Lord be praised! Day after day He bears our burdens; God is our salvation. Selah
{68:20} Our God is a God of salvation, and escape from death belongs to the Lord God.
{68:21} Surely God crushes the heads of His enemies, the hairy head of one who goes on in his guilty acts.
{68:22} The Lord said, “I will bring them back from Bashan; I will bring them back from the depths of the sea
{68:23} so that your foot may wade in blood and your dogs’ tongues may have their share from the enemies.”
{68:24} People have seen Your procession, God, the procession of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.
{68:25} Singers lead the way, with musicians following; among them are young women playing tambourines.
{68:26} Praise God in the assemblies; praise the Lord from the fountain of Israel.
{68:27} There is Benjamin, the youngest, leading them, the rulers of Judah in their assembly, the rulers of Zebulun, the rulers of Naphtali.
{68:28} Your God has decreed your strength. Show Your strength, God, You who have acted on our behalf.
{68:29} Because of Your temple at Jerusalem, kings will bring tribute to You.
{68:30} Rebuke the beast in the reeds, the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples. Trample underfoot those with bars of silver. Scatter the peoples who take pleasure in war.
{68:31} Ambassadors will come from Egypt; Cush will stretch out its hands to God.
{68:32} Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth; sing praise to the Lord, Selah
{68:33} to Him who rides in the ancient, highest heavens. Look, He thunders with His powerful voice!
{68:34} Ascribe power to God. His majesty is over Israel, His power among the clouds.
{68:35} God, You are awe-inspiring in Your sanctuaries. The God of Israel gives power and strength to His people. May God be praised!
{i69:1} A Plea for Rescue For the choir director: according to “The Lilies.” Possibly a tune; Pss 45; 60; 80 Davidic.
{69:1} Save me, God, for the water has risen to my neck.
{69:2} I have sunk in deep mud, and there is no footing; I have come into deep waters, and a flood sweeps over me.
{69:3} I am weary from my crying; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.
{69:4} Those who hate me without cause are more numerous than the hairs of my head; my deceitful enemies, who would destroy me, are powerful. Though I did not steal, I must repay.
{69:5} God, You know my foolishness, and my guilty acts are not hidden from You.
{69:6} Do not let those who put their hope in You be disgraced because of me, Lord God of Hosts; do not let those who seek You be humiliated because of me, God of Israel.
{69:7} For I have endured insults because of You, and shame has covered my face.
{69:8} I have become a stranger to my brothers and a foreigner to my mother’s sons
{69:9} because zeal for Your house has consumed me, and the insults of those who insult You have fallen on me.
{69:10} I mourned and fasted, but it brought me insults.
{69:11} I wore sackcloth as my clothing, and I was a joke to them.
{69:12} Those who sit at the city gate talk about me, and drunkards make up songs about me.
{69:13} But as for me, Lord, my prayer to You is for a time of favor. In Your abundant, faithful love, God, answer me with Your sure salvation.
{69:14} Rescue me from the miry mud; don’t let me sink. Let me be rescued from those who hate me and from the deep waters.
{69:15} Don’t let the floodwaters sweep over me or the deep swallow me up; don’t let the Pit close its mouth over me.
{69:16} Answer me, Lord, for Your faithful love is good; in keeping with Your great compassion, turn to me.
{69:17} Don’t hide Your face from Your servant, for I am in distress. Answer me quickly!
{69:18} Draw near to me and redeem me; ransom me because of my enemies.
{69:19} You know the insults I endure — my shame and disgrace. You are aware of all my adversaries.
{69:20} Insults have broken my heart, and I am in despair. I waited for sympathy, but there was none; for comforters, but found no one.
{69:21} Instead, they gave me gall for my food, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
{69:22} Let their table set before them be a snare, and let it be a trap for their allies.
{69:23} Let their eyes grow too dim to see, and let their loins continually shake.
{69:24} Pour out Your rage on them, and let Your burning anger overtake them.
{69:25} Make their fortification desolate; may no one live in their tents.
{69:26} For they persecute the one You struck and talk about the pain of those You wounded.
{69:27} Add guilt to their guilt; do not let them share in Your righteousness.
{69:28} Let them be erased from the book of life and not be recorded with the righteous.
{69:29} But as for me — poor and in pain — let Your salvation protect me, God.
{69:30} I will praise God’s name with song and exalt Him with thanksgiving.
{69:31} That will please Yahweh more than an ox, more than a bull with horns and hooves.
{69:32} The humble will see it and rejoice. You who seek God, take heart!
{69:33} For the Lord listens to the needy and does not despise His own who are prisoners.
{69:34} Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas and everything that moves in them,
{69:35} for God will save Zion and build up the cities of Judah. They will live there and possess it.
{69:36} The descendants of His servants will inherit it, and those who love His name will live in it.
{i70:1} A Call for Deliverance For the choir director. Davidic. To bring remembrance.
{70:1} God, deliver me. Hurry to help me, Lord!
{70:2} Let those who seek my life be disgraced and confounded; let those who wish me harm be driven back and humiliated.
{70:3} Let those who say, “Aha, aha!” retreat because of their shame.
{70:4} Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; let those who love Your salvation continually say, “God is great!”
{70:5} I am afflicted and needy; hurry to me, God. You are my help and my deliverer; Lord, do not delay.
{i71:1} God’s Help in Old Age
{71:1} Lord, I seek refuge in You; let me never be disgraced.
{71:2} In Your justice, rescue and deliver me; listen closely to me and save me.
{71:3} Be a rock of refuge for me, where I can always go. Give the command to save me, for You are my rock and fortress.
{71:4} Deliver me, my God, from the power of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and oppressive.
{71:5} For You are my hope, Lord God, my confidence from my youth.
{71:6} I have leaned on You from birth; You took me from my mother’s womb. My praise is always about You.
{71:7} I have become an ominous sign to many, but You are my strong refuge.
{71:8} My mouth is full of praise and honor to You all day long.
{71:9} Don’t discard me in my old age; as my strength fails, do not abandon me.
{71:10} For my enemies talk about me, and those who spy on me plot together,
{71:11} saying, “God has abandoned him; chase him and catch him, for there is no one to rescue him.”
{71:12} God, do not be far from me; my God, hurry to help me.
{71:13} May my adversaries be disgraced and destroyed; may those who seek my harm be covered with disgrace and humiliation.
{71:14} But I will hope continually and will praise You more and more.
{71:15} My mouth will tell about Your righteousness and Your salvation all day long, though I cannot sum them up.
{71:16} I come because of the mighty acts of the Lord God; I will proclaim Your righteousness, Yours alone.
{71:17} God, You have taught me from my youth, and I still proclaim Your wonderful works.
{71:18} Even when I am old and gray, God, do not abandon me. Then I will proclaim Your power to another generation, Your strength to all who are to come.
{71:19} Your righteousness reaches heaven, God, You who have done great things; God, who is like You?
{71:20} You caused me to experience many troubles and misfortunes, but You will revive me again. You will bring me up again, even from the depths of the earth.
{71:21} You will increase my honor and comfort me once again.
{71:22} Therefore, I will praise You with a harp for Your faithfulness, my God; I will sing to You with a lyre, Holy One of Israel.
{71:23} My lips will shout for joy when I sing praise to You because You have redeemed me.
{71:24} Therefore, my tongue will proclaim Your righteousness all day long, for those who seek my harm will be disgraced and confounded.
{i72:1} A Prayer for the King Solomonic.
{72:1} God, give Your justice to the king and Your righteousness to the king’s son.
{72:2} He will judge Your people with righteousness and Your afflicted ones with justice.
{72:3} May the mountains bring prosperity to the people and the hills, righteousness.
{72:4} May he vindicate the afflicted among the people, help the poor, and crush the oppressor.
{72:5} May he continue while the sun endures and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.
{72:6} May he be like rain that falls on the cut grass, like spring showers that water the earth.
{72:7} May the righteous flourish in his days and prosperity abound until the moon is no more.
{72:8} May he rule from sea to sea and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth.
{72:9} May desert tribes kneel before him and his enemies lick the dust.
{72:10} May the kings of Tarshish and the coasts and islands bring tribute, the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.
{72:11} Let all kings bow down to him, all nations serve him.
{72:12} For he will rescue the poor who cry out and the afflicted who have no helper.
{72:13} He will have pity on the poor and helpless and save the lives of the poor.
{72:14} He will redeem them from oppression and violence, for their lives are precious in his sight.
{72:15} May he live long! May gold from Sheba be given to him. May prayer be offered for him continually, and may he be blessed all day long.
{72:16} May there be plenty of grain in the land; may it wave on the tops of the mountains. May its crops be like Lebanon. May people flourish in the cities like the grass of the field.
{72:17} May his name endure forever; as long as the sun shines, may his fame increase. May all nations be blessed by him and call him blessed.
{72:18} May the Lord God, the God of Israel, who alone does wonders, be praised.
{72:19} May His glorious name be praised forever; the whole earth is filled with His glory. Amen and amen.
{72:20} The prayers of David son of Jesse are concluded.
{i73:1} BOOK III (Psalms 73–89) God’s Ways Vindicated A psalm of Asaph.
{73:1} God is indeed good to Israel, to the pure in heart.
{73:2} But as for me, my feet almost slipped; my steps nearly went astray.
{73:3} For I envied the arrogant; I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
{73:4} They have an easy time until they die, and their bodies are well fed.
{73:5} They are not in trouble like others; they are not afflicted like most people.
{73:6} Therefore, pride is their necklace, and violence covers them like a garment.
{73:7} Their eyes bulge out from fatness; the imaginations of their hearts run wild.
{73:8} They mock, and they speak maliciously; they arrogantly threaten oppression.
{73:9} They set their mouths against heaven, and their tongues strut across the earth.
{73:10} Therefore His people turn to them and drink in their overflowing words.
{73:11} The wicked say, “How can God know? Does the Most High know everything?”
{73:12} Look at them — the wicked! They are always at ease, and they increase their wealth.
{73:13} Did I purify my heart and wash my hands in innocence for nothing?
{73:14} For I am afflicted all day long and punished every morning.
{73:15} If I had decided to say these things aloud, I would have betrayed Your people.
{73:16} When I tried to understand all this, it seemed hopeless
{73:17} until I entered God’s sanctuary. Then I understood their destiny.
{73:18} Indeed, You put them in slippery places; You make them fall into ruin.
{73:19} How suddenly they become a desolation! They come to an end, swept away by terrors.
{73:20} Like one waking from a dream, Lord, when arising, You will despise their image.
{73:21} When I became embittered and my innermost being was wounded,
{73:22} I was stupid and didn’t understand; I was an unthinking animal toward You.
{73:23} Yet I am always with You; You hold my right hand.
{73:24} You guide me with Your counsel, and afterward You will take me up in glory.
{73:25} Who do I have in heaven but You? And I desire nothing on earth but You.
{73:26} My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart, my portion forever.
{73:27} Those far from You will certainly perish; You destroy all who are unfaithful to You.
{73:28} But as for me, God’s presence is my good. I have made the Lord God my refuge, so I can tell about all You do.
{i74:1} Prayer for Israel A Maskil of Asaph.
{74:1} Why have You rejected us forever, God? Why does Your anger burn against the sheep of Your pasture?
{74:2} Remember Your congregation, which You purchased long ago and redeemed as the tribe for Your own possession. Remember Mount Zion where You dwell.
{74:3} Make Your way to the everlasting ruins, to all that the enemy has destroyed in the sanctuary.
{74:4} Your adversaries roared in the meeting place where You met with us. They set up their emblems as signs.
{74:5} It was like men in a thicket of trees, wielding axes,
{74:6} then smashing all the carvings with hatchets and picks.
{74:7} They set Your sanctuary on fire; they utterly desecrated the dwelling place of Your name.
{74:8} They said in their hearts, “Let us oppress them relentlessly.” They burned down every place throughout the land where God met with us.
{74:9} There are no signs for us to see. There is no longer a prophet. And none of us knows how long this will last.
{74:10} God, how long will the enemy mock? Will the foe insult Your name forever?
{74:11} Why do You hold back Your hand? Stretch out Your right hand and destroy them!
{74:12} God my King is from ancient times, performing saving acts on the earth.
{74:13} You divided the sea with Your strength; You smashed the heads of the sea monsters in the waters;
{74:14} You crushed the heads of Leviathan; You fed him to the creatures of the desert.
{74:15} You opened up springs and streams; You dried up ever-flowing rivers.
{74:16} The day is Yours, also the night; You established the moon and the sun.
{74:17} You set all the boundaries of the earth; You made summer and winter.
{74:18} Remember this: the enemy has mocked Yahweh, and a foolish people has insulted Your name.
{74:19} Do not give the life of Your dove to beasts; do not forget the lives of Your poor people forever.
{74:20} Consider the covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of violence.
{74:21} Do not let the oppressed turn away in shame; let the poor and needy praise Your name.
{74:22} Rise up, God, defend Your cause! Remember the insults that fools bring against You all day long.
{74:23} Do not forget the clamor of Your adversaries, the tumult of Your opponents that goes up constantly.
{i75:1} God Judges the Wicked For the choir director: “Do Not Destroy.” Possibly a tune A psalm of Asaph. A song.
{75:1} We give thanks to You, God; we give thanks to You, for Your name is near. People tell about Your wonderful works.
{75:2} “When I choose a time, I will judge fairly.
{75:3} When the earth and all its inhabitants shake, I am the One who steadies its pillars. Selah
{75:4} I say to the boastful, ‘Do not boast,’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horn.
{75:5} Do not lift up your horn against heaven or speak arrogantly.’”
{75:6} Exaltation does not come from the east, the west, or the desert,
{75:7} for God is the Judge: He brings down one and exalts another.
{75:8} For there is a cup in the Lord’s hand, full of wine blended with spices, and He pours from it. All the wicked of the earth will drink, draining it to the dregs.
{75:9} As for me, I will tell about Him forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.
{75:10} “I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.”
{i76:1} God, the Powerful Judge For the choir director: with stringed instruments. A psalm of Asaph. A song.
{76:1} God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel.
{76:2} His tent is in Salem, His dwelling place in Zion.
{76:3} There He shatters the bow’s flaming arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah
{76:4} You are resplendent and majestic coming down from the mountains of prey.
{76:5} The brave-hearted have been plundered; they have slipped into their final sleep. None of the warriors was able to lift a hand.
{76:6} At Your rebuke, God of Jacob, both chariot and horse lay still.
{76:7} And You — You are to be feared. When You are angry, who can stand before You?
{76:8} From heaven You pronounced judgment. The earth feared and grew quiet
{76:9} when God rose up to judge and to save all the lowly of the earth. Selah
{76:10} Even human wrath will praise You; You will clothe Yourself with their remaining wrath.
{76:11} Make and keep your vows to the Lord your God; let all who are around Him bring tribute to the awe-inspiring One.
{76:12} He humbles the spirit of leaders; He is feared by the kings of the earth.
{i77:1} Confidence in a Time of Crisis For the choir director: according to Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A psalm.
{77:1} I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, and He will hear me.
{77:2} I sought the Lord in my day of trouble. My hands were continually lifted up all night long; I refused to be comforted.
{77:3} I think of God; I groan; I meditate; my spirit becomes weak. Selah
{77:4} You have kept me from closing my eyes; I am troubled and cannot speak.
{77:5} I consider days of old, years long past.
{77:6} At night I remember my music; I meditate in my heart, and my spirit ponders.
{77:7} “Will the Lord reject forever and never again show favor?
{77:8} Has His faithful love ceased forever? Is His promise at an end for all generations?
{77:9} Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has He in anger withheld His compassion?” Selah
{77:10} So I say, “I am grieved that the right hand of the Most High has changed.”
{77:11} I will remember the Lord’s works; yes, I will remember Your ancient wonders.
{77:12} I will reflect on all You have done and meditate on Your actions.
{77:13} God, Your way is holy. What god is great like God?
{77:14} You are the God who works wonders; You revealed Your strength among the peoples.
{77:15} With power You redeemed Your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
{77:16} The waters saw You, God. The waters saw You; they trembled. Even the depths shook.
{77:17} The clouds poured down water. The storm clouds thundered; Your arrows flashed back and forth.
{77:18} The sound of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; lightning lit up the world. The earth shook and quaked.
{77:19} Your way went through the sea and Your path through the great waters, but Your footprints were unseen.
{77:20} You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
{i78:1} Lessons from Israel’s Past A Maskil of Asaph.
{78:1} My people, hear my instruction; listen to what I say.
{78:2} I will declare wise sayings; I will speak mysteries from the past —
{78:3} things we have heard and known and that our fathers have passed down to us.
{78:4} We must not hide them from their children, but must tell a future generation the praises of the Lord, His might, and the wonderful works He has performed.
{78:5} He established a testimony in Jacob and set up a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers to teach to their children
{78:6} so that a future generation — children yet to be born — might know. They were to rise and tell their children
{78:7} so that they might put their confidence in God and not forget God’s works, but keep His commands.
{78:8} Then they would not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not loyal and whose spirit was not faithful to God.
{78:9} The Ephraimite archers turned back on the day of battle.
{78:10} They did not keep God’s covenant and refused to live by His law.
{78:11} They forgot what He had done, the wonderful works He had shown them.
{78:12} He worked wonders in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt, the region of Zoan.
{78:13} He split the sea and brought them across; the water stood firm like a wall.
{78:14} He led them with a cloud by day and with a fiery light throughout the night.
{78:15} He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as abundant as the depths.
{78:16} He brought streams out of the stone and made water flow down like rivers.
{78:17} But they continued to sin against Him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.
{78:18} They deliberately tested God, demanding the food they craved.
{78:19} They spoke against God, saying, “Is God able to provide food in the wilderness?
{78:20} Look! He struck the rock and water gushed out; torrents overflowed. But can He also provide bread or furnish meat for His people?”
{78:21} Therefore, the Lord heard and became furious; then fire broke out against Jacob, and anger flared up against Israel
{78:22} because they did not believe God or rely on His salvation.
{78:23} He gave a command to the clouds above and opened the doors of heaven.
{78:24} He rained manna for them to eat; He gave them grain from heaven.
{78:25} People ate the bread of angels. He sent them an abundant supply of food.
{78:26} He made the east wind blow in the skies and drove the south wind by His might.
{78:27} He rained meat on them like dust, and winged birds like the sand of the seas.
{78:28} He made them fall in His camp, all around His tent.
{78:29} They ate and were completely satisfied, for He gave them what they craved.
{78:30} Before they had satisfied their desire, while the food was still in their mouths,
{78:31} God’s anger flared up against them, and He killed some of their best men. He struck down Israel’s choice young men.
{78:32} Despite all this, they kept sinning and did not believe His wonderful works.
{78:33} He made their days end in futility, their years in sudden disaster.
{78:34} When He killed some of them, the rest began to seek Him; they repented and searched for God.
{78:35} They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their Redeemer.
{78:36} But they deceived Him with their mouths, they lied to Him with their tongues,
{78:37} their hearts were insincere toward Him, and they were unfaithful to His covenant.
{78:38} Yet He was compassionate; He atoned for their guilt and did not destroy them. He often turned His anger aside and did not unleash all His wrath.
{78:39} He remembered that they were only flesh, a wind that passes and does not return.
{78:40} How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness and grieved Him in the desert.
{78:41} They constantly tested God and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
{78:42} They did not remember His power shown on the day He redeemed them from the foe,
{78:43} when He performed His miraculous signs in Egypt and His wonders in the region of Zoan.
{78:44} He turned their rivers into blood, and they could not drink from their streams.
{78:45} He sent among them swarms of flies, which fed on them, and frogs, which devastated them.
{78:46} He gave their crops to the caterpillar and the fruit of their labor to the locust.
{78:47} He killed their vines with hail and their sycamore fig trees with a flood.
{78:48} He handed over their livestock to hail and their cattle to lightning bolts.
{78:49} He sent His burning anger against them: fury, indignation, and calamity — a band of deadly messengers.
{78:50} He cleared a path for His anger. He did not spare them from death but delivered their lives to the plague.
{78:51} He struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the first progeny of the tents of Ham.
{78:52} He led His people out like sheep and guided them like a flock in the wilderness.
{78:53} He led them safely, and they were not afraid; but the sea covered their enemies.
{78:54} He brought them to His holy land, to the mountain His right hand acquired.
{78:55} He drove out nations before them. He apportioned their inheritance by lot and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
{78:56} But they rebelliously tested the Most High God, for they did not keep His decrees.
{78:57} They treacherously turned away like their fathers; they became warped like a faulty bow.
{78:58} They enraged Him with their high places and provoked His jealousy with their carved images.
{78:59} God heard and became furious; He completely rejected Israel.
{78:60} He abandoned the tabernacle at Shiloh, the tent where He resided among men.
{78:61} He gave up His strength to captivity and His splendor to the hand of a foe.
{78:62} He surrendered His people to the sword because He was enraged with His heritage.
{78:63} Fire consumed His chosen young men, and His young women had no wedding songs.
{78:64} His priests fell by the sword, but the widows could not lament.
{78:65} Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, like a warrior from the effects of wine.
{78:66} He beat back His foes; He gave them lasting shame.
{78:67} He rejected the tent of Joseph and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.
{78:68} He chose instead the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved.
{78:69} He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that He established forever.
{78:70} He chose David His servant and took him from the sheepfolds;
{78:71} He brought him from tending ewes to be shepherd over His people Jacob — over Israel, His inheritance.
{78:72} He shepherded them with a pure heart and guided them with his skillful hands.
{i79:1} Faith amid Confusion A psalm of Asaph.
{79:1} God, the nations have invaded Your inheritance, desecrated Your holy temple, and turned Jerusalem into ruins.
{79:2} They gave the corpses of Your servants to the birds of the sky for food, the flesh of Your godly ones to the beasts of the earth.
{79:3} They poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.
{79:4} We have become an object of reproach to our neighbors, a source of mockery and ridicule to those around us.
{79:5} How long, Yahweh? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy keep burning like fire?
{79:6} Pour out Your wrath on the nations that don’t acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that don’t call on Your name,
{79:7} for they have devoured Jacob and devastated his homeland.
{79:8} Do not hold past sins against us; let Your compassion come to us quickly, for we have become weak.
{79:9} God of our salvation, help us — for the glory of Your name. Deliver us and atone for our sins, because of Your name.
{79:10} Why should the nations ask, “Where is their God?” Before our eyes, let vengeance for the shed blood of Your servants be known among the nations.
{79:11} Let the groans of the prisoners reach You; according to Your great power, preserve those condemned to die.
{79:12} Pay back sevenfold to our neighbors the reproach they have hurled at You, Lord.
{79:13} Then we, Your people, the sheep of Your pasture, will thank You forever; we will declare Your praise to generation after generation.
{i80:1} A Prayer for Restoration For the choir director: according to “The Lilies.” Possibly a tune; Pss 45; 60; 69 A testimony of Asaph. A psalm.
{80:1} Listen, Shepherd of Israel, who leads Joseph like a flock; You who sit enthroned on the cherubim, rise up
{80:2} before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Rally Your power and come to save us.
{80:3} Restore us, God; look on us with favor, and we will be saved.
{80:4} Lord God of Hosts, how long will You be angry with Your people’s prayers?
{80:5} You fed them the bread of tears and gave them a full measure of tears to drink.
{80:6} You make us quarrel with our neighbors; our enemies make fun of us.
{80:7} Restore us, God of Hosts; look on us with favor, and we will be saved.
{80:8} You uprooted a vine from Egypt; You drove out the nations and planted it.
{80:9} You cleared a place for it; it took root and filled the land.
{80:10} The mountains were covered by its shade, and the mighty cedars with its branches.
{80:11} It sent out sprouts toward the Sea and shoots toward the River.
{80:12} Why have You broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its fruit?
{80:13} The boar from the forest tears it and creatures of the field feed on it.
{80:14} Return, God of Hosts. Look down from heaven and see; take care of this vine,
{80:15} the root Your right hand has planted, the shoot that You made strong for Yourself.
{80:16} It was cut down and burned up; they perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.
{80:17} Let Your hand be with the man at Your right hand, with the son of man You have made strong for Yourself.
{80:18} Then we will not turn away from You; revive us, and we will call on Your name.
{80:19} Restore us, Yahweh, the God of Hosts; look on us with favor, and we will be saved.
{i81:1} A Call to Obedience For the choir director: on the Gittith . Of Asaph.
{81:1} Sing for joy to God our strength; shout in triumph to the God of Jacob.
{81:2} Lift up a song — play the tambourine, the melodious lyre, and the harp.
{81:3} Blow the horn on the day of our feasts during the new moon and during the full moon.
{81:4} For this is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the God of Jacob.
{81:5} He set it up as an ordinance for Joseph when He went throughout the land of Egypt. I heard an unfamiliar language:
{81:6} “I relieved his shoulder from the burden; his hands were freed from carrying the basket.
{81:7} You called out in distress, and I rescued you; I answered you from the thundercloud. I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah
{81:8} Listen, My people, and I will admonish you. Israel, if you would only listen to Me!
{81:9} There must not be a strange god among you; you must not bow down to a foreign god.
{81:10} I am Yahweh your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
{81:11} “But My people did not listen to Me; Israel did not obey Me.
{81:12} So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own plans.
{81:13} If only My people would listen to Me and Israel would follow My ways,
{81:14} I would quickly subdue their enemies and turn My hand against their foes.”
{81:15} Those who hate the Lord would pretend submission to Him; their doom would last forever.
{81:16} But He would feed Israel with the best wheat. “I would satisfy you with honey from the rock.”
{i82:1} A Plea for Righteous Judgment A psalm of Asaph.
{82:1} God has taken His place in the divine assembly; He judges among the gods:
{82:2} “How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah
{82:3} Provide justice for the needy and the fatherless; uphold the rights of the oppressed and the destitute.
{82:4} Rescue the poor and needy; save them from the power of the wicked.”
{82:5} They do not know or understand; they wander in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
{82:6} I said, “You are gods; you are all sons of the Most High.
{82:7} However, you will die like men and fall like any other ruler.”
{82:8} Rise up, God, judge the earth, for all the nations belong to You.
{i83:1} Prayer against Enemies A song. A psalm of Asaph.
{83:1} God, do not keep silent. Do not be deaf, God; do not be idle.
{83:2} See how Your enemies make an uproar; those who hate You have acted arrogantly.
{83:3} They devise clever schemes against Your people; they conspire against Your treasured ones.
{83:4} They say, “Come, let us wipe them out as a nation so that Israel’s name will no longer be remembered.”
{83:5} For they have conspired with one mind; they form an alliance against You —
{83:6} the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites,
{83:7} Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre.
{83:8} Even Assyria has joined them; they lend support to the sons of Lot. Selah
{83:9} Deal with them as You did with Midian, as You did with Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River.
{83:10} They were destroyed at En-dor; they became manure for the ground.
{83:11} Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and all their tribal leaders like Zebah and Zalmunna,
{83:12} who said, “Let us seize God’s pastures for ourselves.”
{83:13} Make them like tumbleweed, my God, like straw before the wind.
{83:14} As fire burns a forest, as a flame blazes through mountains,
{83:15} so pursue them with Your tempest and terrify them with Your storm.
{83:16} Cover their faces with shame so that they will seek Your name Yahweh.
{83:17} Let them be put to shame and terrified forever; let them perish in disgrace.
{83:18} May they know that You alone — whose name is Yahweh — are the Most High over all the earth.
{i84:1} Longing for God’s House For the choir director: on the Gittith . A psalm of the sons of Korah.
{84:1} How lovely is Your dwelling place, Lord of Hosts.
{84:2} I long and yearn for the courts of the Lord; my heart and flesh cry out for the living God.
{84:3} Even a sparrow finds a home, and a swallow, a nest for herself where she places her young — near Your altars, Lord of Hosts, my King and my God.
{84:4} How happy are those who reside in Your house, who praise You continually. Selah
{84:5} Happy are the people whose strength is in You, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.
{84:6} As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a source of springwater; even the autumn rain will cover it with blessings.
{84:7} They go from strength to strength; each appears before God in Zion.
{84:8} Lord God of Hosts, hear my prayer; listen, God of Jacob. Selah
{84:9} Consider our shield, God; look on the face of Your anointed one.
{84:10} Better a day in Your courts than a thousand anywhere else. I would rather be at the door of the house of my God than to live in the tents of wicked people.
{84:11} For the Lord God is a sun and shield. The Lord gives grace and glory; He does not withhold the good from those who live with integrity.
{84:12} Happy is the person who trusts in You, Lord of Hosts!
{i85:1} Restoration of Favor For the choir director. A psalm of the sons of Korah.
{85:1} Lord, You showed favor to Your land; You restored Jacob’s prosperity.
{85:2} You took away Your people’s guilt; You covered all their sin. Selah
{85:3} You withdrew all Your fury; You turned from Your burning anger.
{85:4} Return to us, God of our salvation, and abandon Your displeasure with us.
{85:5} Will You be angry with us forever? Will You prolong Your anger for all generations?
{85:6} Will You not revive us again so that Your people may rejoice in You?
{85:7} Show us Your faithful love, Lord, and give us Your salvation.
{85:8} I will listen to what God will say; surely the Lord will declare peace to His people, His godly ones, and not let them go back to foolish ways.
{85:9} His salvation is very near those who fear Him, so that glory may dwell in our land.
{85:10} Faithful love and truth will join together; righteousness and peace will embrace.
{85:11} Truth will spring up from the earth, and righteousness will look down from heaven.
{85:12} Also, the Lord will provide what is good, and our land will yield its crops.
{85:13} Righteousness will go before Him to prepare the way for His steps.
{i86:1} Lament and Petition A Davidic prayer.
{86:1} Listen, Lord, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.
{86:2} Protect my life, for I am faithful. You are my God; save Your servant who trusts in You.
{86:3} Be gracious to me, Lord, for I call to You all day long.
{86:4} Bring joy to Your servant’s life, because I turn to You, Lord.
{86:5} For You, Lord, are kind and ready to forgive, rich in faithful love to all who call on You.
{86:6} Lord, hear my prayer; listen to my plea for mercy.
{86:7} I call on You in the day of my distress, for You will answer me.
{86:8} Lord, there is no one like You among the gods, and there are no works like Yours.
{86:9} All the nations You have made will come and bow down before You, Lord, and will honor Your name.
{86:10} For You are great and perform wonders; You alone are God.
{86:11} Teach me Your way, Yahweh, and I will live by Your truth. Give me an undivided mind to fear Your name.
{86:12} I will praise You with all my heart, Lord my God, and will honor Your name forever.
{86:13} For Your faithful love for me is great, and You deliver my life from the depths of Sheol.
{86:14} God, arrogant people have attacked me; a gang of ruthless men seeks my life. They have no regard for You.
{86:15} But You, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and rich in faithful love and truth.
{86:16} Turn to me and be gracious to me. Give Your strength to Your servant; save the son of Your female servant.
{86:17} Show me a sign of Your goodness; my enemies will see and be put to shame because You, Lord, have helped and comforted me.
{i87:1} Zion, the City of God A psalm of the sons of Korah. A song.
{87:1} His foundation is on the holy mountains.
{87:2} The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
{87:3} Glorious things are said about you, city of God. Selah
{87:4} “I will mention those who know Me: Rahab, Babylon, Philistia, Tyre, and Cush — each one was born there.”
{87:5} And it will be said of Zion, “This one and that one were born in her.” The Most High Himself will establish her.
{87:6} When He registers the peoples, the Lord will record, “This one was born there.” Selah
{87:7} Singers and dancers alike will say, “My whole source of joy is in you.”
{i88:1} A Cry of Desperation A song. A psalm of the sons of Korah. For the choir director: according to Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite.
{88:1} Lord, God of my salvation, I cry out before You day and night.
{88:2} May my prayer reach Your presence; listen to my cry.
{88:3} For I have had enough troubles, and my life is near Sheol.
{88:4} I am counted among those going down to the Pit. I am like a man without strength,
{88:5} abandoned among the dead. I am like the slain lying in the grave, whom You no longer remember, and who are cut off from Your care.
{88:6} You have put me in the lowest part of the Pit, in the darkest places, in the depths.
{88:7} Your wrath weighs heavily on me; You have overwhelmed me with all Your waves. Selah
{88:8} You have distanced my friends from me; You have made me repulsive to them. I am shut in and cannot go out.
{88:9} My eyes are worn out from crying. Lord, I cry out to You all day long; I spread out my hands to You.
{88:10} Do You work wonders for the dead? Do departed spirits rise up to praise You? Selah
{88:11} Will Your faithful love be declared in the grave, Your faithfulness in Abaddon?
{88:12} Will Your wonders be known in the darkness or Your righteousness in the land of oblivion?
{88:13} But I call to You for help, Lord; in the morning my prayer meets You.
{88:14} Lord, why do You reject me? Why do You hide Your face from me?
{88:15} From my youth, I have been afflicted and near death. I suffer Your horrors; I am desperate.
{88:16} Your wrath sweeps over me; Your terrors destroy me.
{88:17} They surround me like water all day long; they close in on me from every side.
{88:18} You have distanced loved one and neighbor from me; darkness is my only friend.
{i89:1} Perplexity about God’s Promises A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.
{89:1} I will sing about the Lord’s faithful love forever; I will proclaim Your faithfulness to all generations with my mouth.
{89:2} For I will declare, “Faithful love is built up forever; You establish Your faithfulness in the heavens.”
{89:3} The Lord said, “I have made a covenant with My chosen one; I have sworn an oath to David My servant:
{89:4} ‘I will establish your offspring forever and build up your throne for all generations.’” Selah
{89:5} Lord, the heavens praise Your wonders — Your faithfulness also — in the assembly of the holy ones.
{89:6} For who in the skies can compare with the Lord? Who among the heavenly beings is like the Lord?
{89:7} God is greatly feared in the council of the holy ones, more awe-inspiring than all who surround Him.
{89:8} Lord God of Hosts, who is strong like You, Lord? Your faithfulness surrounds You.
{89:9} You rule the raging sea; when its waves surge, You still them.
{89:10} You crushed Rahab like one who is slain; You scattered Your enemies with Your powerful arm.
{89:11} The heavens are Yours; the earth also is Yours. The world and everything in it — You founded them.
{89:12} North and south — You created them. Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at Your name.
{89:13} You have a mighty arm; Your hand is powerful; Your right hand is lifted high.
{89:14} Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; faithful love and truth go before You.
{89:15} Happy are the people who know the joyful shout; Yahweh, they walk in the light of Your presence.
{89:16} They rejoice in Your name all day long, and they are exalted by Your righteousness.
{89:17} For You are their magnificent strength; by Your favor our horn is exalted.
{89:18} Surely our shield belongs to the Lord, our king to the Holy One of Israel.
{89:19} You once spoke in a vision to Your loyal ones and said: “I have granted help to a warrior; I have exalted one chosen from the people.
{89:20} I have found David My servant; I have anointed him with My sacred oil.
{89:21} My hand will always be with him, and My arm will strengthen him.
{89:22} The enemy will not afflict him; no wicked man will oppress him.
{89:23} I will crush his foes before him and strike those who hate him.
{89:24} My faithfulness and love will be with him, and through My name his horn will be exalted.
{89:25} I will extend his power to the sea and his right hand to the rivers.
{89:26} He will call to Me, ‘You are my Father, my God, the rock of my salvation.’
{89:27} I will also make him My firstborn, greatest of the kings of the earth.
{89:28} I will always preserve My faithful love for him, and My covenant with him will endure.
{89:29} I will establish his line forever, his throne as long as heaven lasts.
{89:30} If his sons forsake My instruction and do not live by My ordinances,
{89:31} if they dishonor My statutes and do not keep My commands,
{89:32} then I will call their rebellion to account with the rod, their sin with blows.
{89:33} But I will not withdraw My faithful love from him or betray My faithfulness.
{89:34} I will not violate My covenant or change what My lips have said.
{89:35} Once and for all I have sworn an oath by My holiness; I will not lie to David.
{89:36} His offspring will continue forever, his throne like the sun before Me,
{89:37} like the moon, established forever, a faithful witness in the sky.” Selah
{89:38} But You have spurned and rejected him; You have become enraged with Your anointed.
{89:39} You have repudiated the covenant with Your servant; You have completely dishonored his crown.
{89:40} You have broken down all his walls; You have reduced his fortified cities to ruins.
{89:41} All who pass by plunder him; he has become an object of ridicule to his neighbors.
{89:42} You have lifted high the right hand of his foes; You have made all his enemies rejoice.
{89:43} You have also turned back his sharp sword and have not let him stand in battle.
{89:44} You have made his splendor cease and have overturned his throne.
{89:45} You have shortened the days of his youth; You have covered him with shame. Selah
{89:46} How long, Lord? Will You hide Yourself forever? Will Your anger keep burning like fire?
{89:47} Remember how short my life is. Have You created everyone for nothing?
{89:48} What man can live and never see death? Who can save himself from the power of Sheol? Selah
{89:49} Lord, where are the former acts of Your faithful love that You swore to David in Your faithfulness?
{89:50} Remember, Lord, the ridicule against Your servants — in my heart I carry abuse from all the peoples —
{89:51} how Your enemies have ridiculed, Lord, how they have ridiculed every step of Your anointed.
{89:52} May the Lord be praised forever. Amen and amen.
{i90:1} BOOK IV (Psalms 90–106) Eternal God and Mortal Man A prayer of Moses, the man of God.
{90:1} Lord, You have been our refuge in every generation.
{90:2} Before the mountains were born, before You gave birth to the earth and the world, from eternity to eternity, You are God.
{90:3} You return mankind to the dust, saying, “Return, descendants of Adam.”
{90:4} For in Your sight a thousand years are like yesterday that passes by, like a few hours of the night.
{90:5} You end their lives; they sleep. They are like grass that grows in the morning —
{90:6} in the morning it sprouts and grows; by evening it withers and dries up.
{90:7} For we are consumed by Your anger; we are terrified by Your wrath.
{90:8} You have set our unjust ways before You, our secret sins in the light of Your presence.
{90:9} For all our days ebb away under Your wrath; we end our years like a sigh.
{90:10} Our lives last seventy years or, if we are strong, eighty years. Even the best of them are struggle and sorrow; indeed, they pass quickly and we fly away.
{90:11} Who understands the power of Your anger? Your wrath matches the fear that is due You.
{90:12} Teach us to number our days carefully so that we may develop wisdom in our hearts.
{90:13} Lord — how long? Turn and have compassion on Your servants.
{90:14} Satisfy us in the morning with Your faithful love so that we may shout with joy and be glad all our days.
{90:15} Make us rejoice for as many days as You have humbled us, for as many years as we have seen adversity.
{90:16} Let Your work be seen by Your servants, and Your splendor by their children.
{90:17} Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us; establish for us the work of our hands — establish the work of our hands!
{i91:1} The Protection of the Most High
{91:1} The one who lives under the protection of the Most High dwells in the shadow of the Almighty.
{91:2} I will say to the Lord, “My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.”
{91:3} He Himself will deliver you from the hunter’s net, from the destructive plague.
{91:4} He will cover you with His feathers; you will take refuge under His wings. His faithfulness will be a protective shield.
{91:5} You will not fear the terror of the night, the arrow that flies by day,
{91:6} the plague that stalks in darkness, or the pestilence that ravages at noon.
{91:7} Though a thousand fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand, the pestilence will not reach you.
{91:8} You will only see it with your eyes and witness the punishment of the wicked.
{91:9} Because you have made the Lord — my refuge, the Most High — your dwelling place,
{91:10} no harm will come to you; no plague will come near your tent.
{91:11} For He will give His angels orders concerning you, to protect you in all your ways.
{91:12} They will support you with their hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.
{91:13} You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the young lion and the serpent.
{91:14} Because he is lovingly devoted to Me, I will deliver him; I will protect him because he knows My name.
{91:15} When he calls out to Me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble. I will rescue him and give him honor.
{91:16} I will satisfy him with a long life and show him My salvation.
{i92:1} God’s Love and Faithfulness A psalm. A song for the Sabbath day.
{92:1} It is good to praise Yahweh, to sing praise to Your name, Most High,
{92:2} to declare Your faithful love in the morning and Your faithfulness at night,
{92:3} with a ten-stringed harp and the music of a lyre.
{92:4} For You have made me rejoice, Lord, by what You have done; I will shout for joy because of the works of Your hands.
{92:5} How magnificent are Your works, Lord, how profound Your thoughts!
{92:6} A stupid person does not know, a fool does not understand this:
{92:7} though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be eternally destroyed.
{92:8} But You, Lord, are exalted forever.
{92:9} For indeed, Lord, Your enemies — indeed, Your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered.
{92:10} You have lifted up my horn like that of a wild ox; I have been anointed with oil.
{92:11} My eyes look down on my enemies; my ears hear evildoers when they attack me.
{92:12} The righteous thrive like a palm tree and grow like a cedar tree in Lebanon.
{92:13} Planted in the house of the Lord, they thrive in the courts of our God.
{92:14} They will still bear fruit in old age, healthy and green,
{92:15} to declare: “The Lord is just; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.”
{i93:1} God’s Eternal Reign
{93:1} The Lord reigns! He is robed in majesty; The Lord is robed, enveloped in strength. The world is firmly established; it cannot be shaken.
{93:2} Your throne has been established from the beginning; You are from eternity.
{93:3} The floods have lifted up, Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their pounding waves.
{93:4} Greater than the roar of many waters — the mighty breakers of the sea — the Lord on high is majestic.
{93:5} Lord, Your testimonies are completely reliable; holiness is the beauty of Your house for all the days to come.
{i94:1} The Just Judge
{94:1} Lord, God of vengeance — God of vengeance, appear.
{94:2} Rise up, Judge of the earth; repay the proud what they deserve.
{94:3} Lord, how long will the wicked — how long will the wicked gloat?
{94:4} They pour out arrogant words; all the evildoers boast.
{94:5} Lord, they crush Your people; they afflict Your heritage.
{94:6} They kill the widow and the foreigner and murder the fatherless.
{94:7} They say, “The Lord doesn’t see it. The God of Jacob doesn’t pay attention.”
{94:8} Pay attention, you stupid people! Fools, when will you be wise?
{94:9} Can the One who shaped the ear not hear, the One who formed the eye not see?
{94:10} The One who instructs nations, the One who teaches man knowledge — does He not discipline?
{94:11} The Lord knows man’s thoughts; they are meaningless.
{94:12} Lord, happy is the man You discipline and teach from Your law
{94:13} to give him relief from troubled times until a pit is dug for the wicked.
{94:14} The Lord will not forsake His people or abandon His heritage,
{94:15} for justice will again be righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it.
{94:16} Who stands up for me against the wicked? Who takes a stand for me against evildoers?
{94:17} If the Lord had not been my helper, I would soon rest in the silence of death.
{94:18} If I say, “My foot is slipping,” Your faithful love will support me, Lord.
{94:19} When I am filled with cares, Your comfort brings me joy.
{94:20} Can a corrupt throne — one that creates trouble by law — become Your ally?
{94:21} They band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.
{94:22} But the Lord is my refuge; my God is the rock of my protection.
{94:23} He will pay them back for their sins and destroy them for their evil. The Lord our God will destroy them.
{i95:1} Worship and Warning
{95:1} Come, let us shout joyfully to the Lord, shout triumphantly to the rock of our salvation!
{95:2} Let us enter His presence with thanksgiving; let us shout triumphantly to Him in song.
{95:3} For the Lord is a great God, a great King above all gods.
{95:4} The depths of the earth are in His hand, and the mountain peaks are His.
{95:5} The sea is His; He made it. His hands formed the dry land.
{95:6} Come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.
{95:7} For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, the sheep under His care. Today, if you hear His voice:
{95:8} Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah, as on that day at Massah in the wilderness
{95:9} where your fathers tested Me; they tried Me, though they had seen what I did.
{95:10} For 40 years I was disgusted with that generation; I said, “They are a people whose hearts go astray; they do not know My ways.”
{95:11} So I swore in My anger, “They will not enter My rest.”
{i96:1} King of the Earth
{96:1} Sing a new song to the Lord; sing to the Lord, all the earth.
{96:2} Sing to Yahweh, praise His name; proclaim His salvation from day to day.
{96:3} Declare His glory among the nations, His wonderful works among all peoples.
{96:4} For the Lord is great and is highly praised; He is feared above all gods.
{96:5} For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.
{96:6} Splendor and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.
{96:7} Ascribe to the Lord, you families of the peoples, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
{96:8} Ascribe to Yahweh the glory of His name; bring an offering and enter His courts.
{96:9} Worship the Lord in the splendor of His holiness; tremble before Him, all the earth.
{96:10} Say among the nations: “The Lord reigns. The world is firmly established; it cannot be shaken. He judges the peoples fairly.”
{96:11} Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice; let the sea and all that fills it resound.
{96:12} Let the fields and everything in them exult. Then all the trees of the forest will shout for joy
{96:13} before the Lord, for He is coming — for He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with His faithfulness.
{i97:1} The Majestic King
{97:1} The Lord reigns! Let the earth rejoice; let the many coasts and islands be glad.
{97:2} Clouds and thick darkness surround Him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.
{97:3} Fire goes before Him and burns up His foes on every side.
{97:4} His lightning lights up the world; the earth sees and trembles.
{97:5} The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the Lord — at the presence of the Lord of all the earth.
{97:6} The heavens proclaim His righteousness; all the peoples see His glory.
{97:7} All who serve carved images, those who boast in idols, will be put to shame. All the gods must worship Him.
{97:8} Zion hears and is glad, and the towns of Judah rejoice because of Your judgments, Lord.
{97:9} For You, Lord, are the Most High over all the earth; You are exalted above all the gods.
{97:10} You who love the Lord, hate evil! He protects the lives of His godly ones; He rescues them from the power of the wicked.
{97:11} Light dawns for the righteous, gladness for the upright in heart.
{97:12} Be glad in Yahweh, you righteous ones, and praise His holy name.
{i98:1} Praise the King A psalm.
{98:1} Sing a new song to the Lord, for He has performed wonders; His right hand and holy arm have won Him victory.
{98:2} The Lord has made His victory known; He has revealed His righteousness in the sight of the nations.
{98:3} He has remembered His love and faithfulness to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen our God’s victory.
{98:4} Shout to the Lord, all the earth; be jubilant, shout for joy, and sing.
{98:5} Sing to the Lord with the lyre, with the lyre and melodious song.
{98:6} With trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn shout triumphantly in the presence of the Lord, our King.
{98:7} Let the sea and all that fills it, the world and those who live in it, resound.
{98:8} Let the rivers clap their hands; let the mountains shout together for joy
{98:9} before the Lord, for He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world righteously and the peoples fairly.
{i99:1} The King Is Holy
{99:1} The Lord reigns! Let the peoples tremble. He is enthroned above the cherubim. Let the earth quake.
{99:2} Yahweh is great in Zion; He is exalted above all the peoples.
{99:3} Let them praise Your great and awe-inspiring name. He is holy.
{99:4} The mighty King loves justice. You have established fairness; You have administered justice and righteousness in Jacob.
{99:5} Exalt the Lord our God; bow in worship at His footstool. He is holy.
{99:6} Moses and Aaron were among His priests; Samuel also was among those calling on His name. They called to Yahweh and He answered them.
{99:7} He spoke to them in a pillar of cloud; they kept His decrees and the statutes He gave them.
{99:8} Lord our God, You answered them. You were a forgiving God to them, an avenger of their sinful actions.
{99:9} Exalt the Lord our God; bow in worship at His holy mountain, for the Lord our God is holy.
{i100:1} Be Thankful A psalm of thanksgiving.
{100:1} Shout triumphantly to the Lord, all the earth.
{100:2} Serve the Lord with gladness; come before Him with joyful songs.
{100:3} Acknowledge that Yahweh is God. He made us, and we are His — His people, the sheep of His pasture.
{100:4} Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him and praise His name.
{100:5} For Yahweh is good, and His love is eternal; His faithfulness endures through all generations.
{i101:1} A Vow of Integrity A Davidic psalm.
{101:1} I will sing of faithful love and justice; I will sing praise to You, Lord.
{101:2} I will pay attention to the way of integrity. When will You come to me? I will live with a heart of integrity in my house.
{101:3} I will not set anything worthless before my eyes. I hate the practice of transgression; it will not cling to me.
{101:4} A devious heart will be far from me; I will not be involved with evil.
{101:5} I will destroy anyone who secretly slanders his neighbor; I cannot tolerate anyone with haughty eyes or an arrogant heart.
{101:6} My eyes favor the faithful of the land so that they may sit down with me. The one who follows the way of integrity may serve me.
{101:7} No one who acts deceitfully will live in my palace; no one who tells lies will remain in my presence.
{101:8} Every morning I will destroy all the wicked of the land, eliminating all evildoers from the Lord’s city.
{i102:1} Affliction in Light of Eternity A prayer of an afflicted person who is weak and pours out his lament before the Lord .
{102:1} Lord, hear my prayer; let my cry for help come before You.
{102:2} Do not hide Your face from me in my day of trouble. Listen closely to me; answer me quickly when I call.
{102:3} For my days vanish like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace.
{102:4} My heart is afflicted, withered like grass; I even forget to eat my food.
{102:5} Because of the sound of my groaning, my flesh sticks to my bones.
{102:6} I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins.
{102:7} I stay awake; I am like a solitary bird on a roof.
{102:8} My enemies taunt me all day long; they ridicule and curse me.
{102:9} I eat ashes like bread and mingle my drinks with tears
{102:10} because of Your indignation and wrath; for You have picked me up and thrown me aside.
{102:11} My days are like a lengthening shadow, and I wither away like grass.
{102:12} But You, Lord, are enthroned forever; Your fame endures to all generations.
{102:13} You will rise up and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her — the appointed time has come.
{102:14} For Your servants take delight in its stones and favor its dust.
{102:15} Then the nations will fear the name of Yahweh, and all the kings of the earth Your glory,
{102:16} for the Lord will rebuild Zion; He will appear in His glory.
{102:17} He will pay attention to the prayer of the destitute and will not despise their prayer.
{102:18} This will be written for a later generation, and a newly created people will praise the Lord:
{102:19} He looked down from His holy heights — the Lord gazed out from heaven to earth —
{102:20} to hear a prisoner’s groaning, to set free those condemned to die,
{102:21} so that they might declare the name of Yahweh in Zion and His praise in Jerusalem,
{102:22} when peoples and kingdoms are assembled to serve the Lord.
{102:23} He has broken my strength in midcourse; He has shortened my days.
{102:24} I say: “My God, do not take me in the middle of my life! Your years continue through all generations.
{102:25} Long ago You established the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands.
{102:26} They will perish, but You will endure; all of them will wear out like clothing. You will change them like a garment, and they will pass away.
{102:27} But You are the same, and Your years will never end.
{102:28} Your servants’ children will dwell securely, and their offspring will be established before You.”
{i103:1} The Forgiving God Davidic.
{103:1} My soul, praise Yahweh, and all that is within me, praise His holy name.
{103:2} My soul, praise the Lord, and do not forget all His benefits.
{103:3} He forgives all your sin; He heals all your diseases.
{103:4} He redeems your life from the Pit; He crowns you with faithful love and compassion.
{103:5} He satisfies you with goodness; your youth is renewed like the eagle.
{103:6} The Lord executes acts of righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.
{103:7} He revealed His ways to Moses, His deeds to the people of Israel.
{103:8} The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and rich in faithful love.
{103:9} He will not always accuse us or be angry forever.
{103:10} He has not dealt with us as our sins deserve or repaid us according to our offenses.
{103:11} For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is His faithful love toward those who fear Him.
{103:12} As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.
{103:13} As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him.
{103:14} For He knows what we are made of, remembering that we are dust.
{103:15} As for man, his days are like grass — he blooms like a flower of the field;
{103:16} when the wind passes over it, it vanishes, and its place is no longer known.
{103:17} But from eternity to eternity the Lord’s faithful love is toward those who fear Him, and His righteousness toward the grandchildren
{103:18} of those who keep His covenant, who remember to observe His precepts.
{103:19} The Lord has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all.
{103:20} Praise the Lord, all His angels of great strength, who do His word, obedient to His command.
{103:21} Praise the Lord, all His armies, His servants who do His will.
{103:22} Praise the Lord, all His works in all the places where He rules. My soul, praise Yahweh!
{i104:1} God the Creator
{104:1} My soul, praise Yahweh! Lord my God, You are very great; You are clothed with majesty and splendor.
{104:2} He wraps Himself in light as if it were a robe, spreading out the sky like a canopy,
{104:3} laying the beams of His palace on the waters above, making the clouds His chariot, walking on the wings of the wind,
{104:4} and making the winds His messengers, flames of fire His servants.
{104:5} He established the earth on its foundations; it will never be shaken.
{104:6} You covered it with the deep as if it were a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.
{104:7} At Your rebuke the waters fled; at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away —
{104:8} mountains rose and valleys sank — to the place You established for them.
{104:9} You set a boundary they cannot cross; they will never cover the earth again.
{104:10} He causes the springs to gush into the valleys; they flow between the mountains.
{104:11} They supply water for every wild beast; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
{104:12} The birds of the sky live beside the springs; they sing among the foliage.
{104:13} He waters the mountains from His palace; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of Your labor.
{104:14} He causes grass to grow for the livestock and provides crops for man to cultivate, producing food from the earth,
{104:15} wine that makes man’s heart glad — making his face shine with oil — and bread that sustains man’s heart.
{104:16} The trees of the Lord flourish, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted.
{104:17} There the birds make their nests; the stork makes its home in the pine trees.
{104:18} The high mountains are for the wild goats; the cliffs are a refuge for hyraxes.
{104:19} He made the moon to mark the festivals; the sun knows when to set.
{104:20} You bring darkness, and it becomes night, when all the forest animals stir.
{104:21} The young lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.
{104:22} The sun rises; they go back and lie down in their dens.
{104:23} Man goes out to his work and to his labor until evening.
{104:24} How countless are Your works, Lord! In wisdom You have made them all; the earth is full of Your creatures.
{104:25} Here is the sea, vast and wide, teeming with creatures beyond number — living things both large and small.
{104:26} There the ships move about, and Leviathan, which You formed to play there.
{104:27} All of them wait for You to give them their food at the right time.
{104:28} When You give it to them, they gather it; when You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good things.
{104:29} When You hide Your face, they are terrified; when You take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.
{104:30} When You send Your breath, they are created, and You renew the face of the earth.
{104:31} May the glory of the Lord endure forever; may the Lord rejoice in His works.
{104:32} He looks at the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they pour out smoke.
{104:33} I will sing to the Lord all my life; I will sing praise to my God while I live.
{104:34} May my meditation be pleasing to Him; I will rejoice in the Lord.
{104:35} May sinners vanish from the earth and wicked people be no more. My soul, praise Yahweh! Hallelujah!
{i105:1} God’s Faithfulness to His People
{105:1} Give thanks to Yahweh, call on His name; proclaim His deeds among the peoples.
{105:2} Sing to Him, sing praise to Him; tell about all His wonderful works!
{105:3} Honor His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.
{105:4} Search for the Lord and for His strength; seek His face always.
{105:5} Remember the wonderful works He has done, His wonders, and the judgments He has pronounced,
{105:6} you offspring of Abraham His servant, Jacob’s descendants — His chosen ones.
{105:7} He is the Lord our God; His judgments govern the whole earth.
{105:8} He remembers His covenant forever, the promise He ordained for a thousand generations —
{105:9} the covenant He made with Abraham, swore to Isaac,
{105:10} and confirmed to Jacob as a decree and to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
{105:11} “I will give the land of Canaan to you as your inherited portion.”
{105:12} When they were few in number, very few indeed, and temporary residents in Canaan,
{105:13} wandering from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another,
{105:14} He allowed no one to oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf:
{105:15} “Do not touch My anointed ones, or harm My prophets.”
{105:16} He called down famine against the land and destroyed the entire food supply.
{105:17} He had sent a man ahead of them — Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
{105:18} They hurt his feet with shackles; his neck was put in an iron collar.
{105:19} Until the time his prediction came true, the word of the Lord tested him.
{105:20} The king sent for him and released him; the ruler of peoples set him free.
{105:21} He made him master of his household, ruler over all his possessions —
{105:22} binding his officials at will and instructing his elders.
{105:23} Then Israel went to Egypt; Jacob lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham.
{105:24} The Lord made His people very fruitful; He made them more numerous than their foes,
{105:25} whose hearts He turned to hate His people and to deal deceptively with His servants.
{105:26} He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron, whom He had chosen.
{105:27} They performed His miraculous signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
{105:28} He sent darkness, and it became dark — for did they not defy His commands?
{105:29} He turned their water into blood and caused their fish to die.
{105:30} Their land was overrun with frogs, even in their royal chambers.
{105:31} He spoke, and insects came — gnats throughout their country.
{105:32} He gave them hail for rain, and lightning throughout their land.
{105:33} He struck their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their territory.
{105:34} He spoke, and locusts came — young locusts without number.
{105:35} They devoured all the vegetation in their land and consumed the produce of their land.
{105:36} He struck all the firstborn in their land, all their first progeny.
{105:37} Then He brought Israel out with silver and gold, and no one among His tribes stumbled.
{105:38} Egypt was glad when they left, for the dread of Israel had fallen on them.
{105:39} He spread a cloud as a covering and gave a fire to light up the night.
{105:40} They asked, and He brought quail and satisfied them with bread from heaven.
{105:41} He opened a rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a stream in the desert.
{105:42} For He remembered His holy promise to Abraham His servant.
{105:43} He brought His people out with rejoicing, His chosen ones with shouts of joy.
{105:44} He gave them the lands of the nations, and they inherited what other peoples had worked for.
{105:45} All this happened so that they might keep His statutes and obey His instructions. Hallelujah!
{i106:1} Israel’s Unfaithfulness to God
{106:1} Hallelujah! Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His faithful love endures forever.
{106:2} Who can declare the Lord’s mighty acts or proclaim all the praise due Him?
{106:3} How happy are those who uphold justice, who practice righteousness at all times.
{106:4} Remember me, Lord, when You show favor to Your people. Come to me with Your salvation
{106:5} so that I may enjoy the prosperity of Your chosen ones, rejoice in the joy of Your nation, and boast about Your heritage.
{106:6} Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have done wrong and have acted wickedly.
{106:7} Our fathers in Egypt did not grasp the significance of Your wonderful works or remember Your many acts of faithful love; instead, they rebelled by the sea — the Red Sea.
{106:8} Yet He saved them because of His name, to make His power known.
{106:9} He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; He led them through the depths as through a desert.
{106:10} He saved them from the hand of the adversary; He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
{106:11} Water covered their foes; not one of them remained.
{106:12} Then they believed His promises and sang His praise.
{106:13} They soon forgot His works and would not wait for His counsel.
{106:14} They were seized with craving in the wilderness and tested God in the desert.
{106:15} He gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease among them.
{106:16} In the camp they were envious of Moses and of Aaron, the Lord’s holy one.
{106:17} The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it covered the assembly of Abiram.
{106:18} Fire blazed throughout their assembly; flames consumed the wicked.
{106:19} At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped the cast metal image.
{106:20} They exchanged their glory for the image of a grass-eating ox.
{106:21} They forgot God their Savior, who did great things in Egypt,
{106:22} wonderful works in the land of Ham, awe-inspiring acts at the Red Sea.
{106:23} So He said He would have destroyed them — if Moses His chosen one had not stood before Him in the breach to turn His wrath away from destroying them.
{106:24} They despised the pleasant land and did not believe His promise.
{106:25} They grumbled in their tents and did not listen to the Lord’s voice.
{106:26} So He raised His hand against them with an oath that He would make them fall in the desert
{106:27} and would disperse their descendants among the nations, scattering them throughout the lands.
{106:28} They aligned themselves with Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods.
{106:29} They provoked the Lord with their deeds, and a plague broke out against them.
{106:30} But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was stopped.
{106:31} It was credited to him as righteousness throughout all generations to come.
{106:32} They angered the Lord at the waters of Meribah, and Moses suffered because of them;
{106:33} for they embittered his spirit, and he spoke rashly with his lips.
{106:34} They did not destroy the peoples as the Lord had commanded them
{106:35} but mingled with the nations and adopted their ways.
{106:36} They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
{106:37} They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons.
{106:38} They shed innocent blood — the blood of their sons and daughters whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; so the land became polluted with blood.
{106:39} They defiled themselves by their actions and prostituted themselves by their deeds.
{106:40} Therefore the Lord’s anger burned against His people, and He abhorred His own inheritance.
{106:41} He handed them over to the nations; those who hated them ruled them.
{106:42} Their enemies oppressed them, and they were subdued under their power.
{106:43} He rescued them many times, but they continued to rebel deliberately and were beaten down by their sin.
{106:44} When He heard their cry, He took note of their distress,
{106:45} remembered His covenant with them, and relented according to the riches of His faithful love.
{106:46} He caused them to be pitied before all their captors.
{106:47} Save us, Yahweh our God, and gather us from the nations, so that we may give thanks to Your holy name and rejoice in Your praise.
{106:48} May Yahweh, the God of Israel, be praised from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, “Amen!” Hallelujah!
{i107:1} BOOK V (Psalms 107–150) Thanksgiving for God’s Deliverance
{107:1} Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His faithful love endures forever.
{107:2} Let the redeemed of the Lord proclaim that He has redeemed them from the hand of the foe
{107:3} and has gathered them from the lands — from the east and the west, from the north and the south.
{107:4} Some wandered in the desolate wilderness, finding no way to a city where they could live.
{107:5} They were hungry and thirsty; their spirits failed within them.
{107:6} Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble; He rescued them from their distress.
{107:7} He led them by the right path to go to a city where they could live.
{107:8} Let them give thanks to the Lord for His faithful love and His wonderful works for all humanity.
{107:9} For He has satisfied the thirsty and filled the hungry with good things.
{107:10} Others sat in darkness and gloom — prisoners in cruel chains —
{107:11} because they rebelled against God’s commands and despised the counsel of the Most High.
{107:12} He broke their spirits with hard labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.
{107:13} Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble; He saved them from their distress.
{107:14} He brought them out of darkness and gloom and broke their chains apart.
{107:15} Let them give thanks to the Lord for His faithful love and His wonderful works for all humanity.
{107:16} For He has broken down the bronze gates and cut through the iron bars.
{107:17} Fools suffered affliction because of their rebellious ways and their sins.
{107:18} They loathed all food and came near the gates of death.
{107:19} Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble; He saved them from their distress.
{107:20} He sent His word and healed them; He rescued them from the Pit.
{107:21} Let them give thanks to the Lord for His faithful love and His wonderful works for all humanity.
{107:22} Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and announce His works with shouts of joy.
{107:23} Others went to sea in ships, conducting trade on the vast waters.
{107:24} They saw the Lord’s works, His wonderful works in the deep.
{107:25} He spoke and raised a tempest that stirred up the waves of the sea.
{107:26} Rising up to the sky, sinking down to the depths, their courage melting away in anguish,
{107:27} they reeled and staggered like drunken men, and all their skill was useless.
{107:28} Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and He brought them out of their distress.
{107:29} He stilled the storm to a murmur, and the waves of the sea were hushed.
{107:30} They rejoiced when the waves grew quiet. Then He guided them to the harbor they longed for.
{107:31} Let them give thanks to the Lord for His faithful love and His wonderful works for all humanity.
{107:32} Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people and praise Him in the council of the elders.
{107:33} He turns rivers into desert, springs of water into thirsty ground,
{107:34} and fruitful land into salty wasteland, because of the wickedness of its inhabitants.
{107:35} He turns a desert into a pool of water, dry land into springs of water.
{107:36} He causes the hungry to settle there, and they establish a city where they can live.
{107:37} They sow fields and plant vineyards that yield a fruitful harvest.
{107:38} He blesses them, and they multiply greatly; He does not let their livestock decrease.
{107:39} When they are diminished and are humbled by cruel oppression and sorrow,
{107:40} He pours contempt on nobles and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.
{107:41} But He lifts the needy out of their suffering and makes their families multiply like flocks.
{107:42} The upright see it and rejoice, and all injustice shuts its mouth.
{107:43} Let whoever is wise pay attention to these things and consider the Lord’s acts of faithful love.
{i108:1} A Plea for Victory A song. A Davidic psalm.
{108:1} My heart is confident, God; I will sing; I will sing praises with the whole of my being.
{108:2} Wake up, harp and lyre! I will wake up the dawn.
{108:3} I will praise You, Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to You among the nations.
{108:4} For Your faithful love is higher than the heavens, and Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
{108:5} God, be exalted above the heavens, and let Your glory be over the whole earth.
{108:6} Save with Your right hand and answer me so that those You love may be rescued.
{108:7} God has spoken in His sanctuary: “I will triumph! I will divide up Shechem. I will apportion the Valley of Succoth.
{108:8} Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine, and Ephraim is My helmet; Judah is My scepter.
{108:9} Moab is My washbasin; I throw My sandal on Edom. I shout in triumph over Philistia.”
{108:10} Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
{108:11} God, haven’t You rejected us? God, You do not march out with our armies.
{108:12} Give us aid against the foe, for human help is worthless.
{108:13} With God we will perform valiantly; He will trample our foes.
{i109:1} Prayer against an Enemy For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.
{109:1} God of my praise, do not be silent.
{109:2} For wicked and deceitful mouths open against me; they speak against me with lying tongues.
{109:3} They surround me with hateful words and attack me without cause.
{109:4} In return for my love they accuse me, but I continue to pray.
{109:5} They repay me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
{109:6} Set a wicked person over him; let an accuser stand at his right hand.
{109:7} When he is judged, let him be found guilty, and let his prayer be counted as sin.
{109:8} Let his days be few; let another take over his position.
{109:9} Let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.
{109:10} Let his children wander as beggars, searching for food far from their demolished homes.
{109:11} Let a creditor seize all he has; let strangers plunder what he has worked for.
{109:12} Let no one show him kindness, and let no one be gracious to his fatherless children.
{109:13} Let the line of his descendants be cut off; let their name be blotted out in the next generation.
{109:14} Let his ancestors’ guilt be remembered before the Lord, and do not let his mother’s sin be blotted out.
{109:15} Let their sins always remain before the Lord, and let Him erase all memory of them from the earth.
{109:16} For he did not think to show kindness, but pursued the afflicted, poor, and brokenhearted in order to put them to death.
{109:17} He loved cursing — let it fall on him; he took no delight in blessing — let it be far from him.
{109:18} He wore cursing like his coat — let it enter his body like water and go into his bones like oil.
{109:19} Let it be like a robe he wraps around himself, like a belt he always wears.
{109:20} Let this be the Lord’s payment to my accusers, to those who speak evil against me.
{109:21} But You, Yahweh my Lord, deal kindly with me because of Your name; deliver me because of the goodness of Your faithful love.
{109:22} For I am afflicted and needy; my heart is wounded within me.
{109:23} I fade away like a lengthening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.
{109:24} My knees are weak from fasting, and my body is emaciated.
{109:25} I have become an object of ridicule to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads in scorn.
{109:26} Help me, Lord my God; save me according to Your faithful love
{109:27} so they may know that this is Your hand and that You, Lord, have done it.
{109:28} Though they curse, You will bless. When they rise up, they will be put to shame, but Your servant will rejoice.
{109:29} My accusers will be clothed with disgrace; they will wear their shame like a cloak.
{109:30} I will fervently thank the Lord with my mouth; I will praise Him in the presence of many.
{109:31} For He stands at the right hand of the needy to save him from those who would condemn him.
{i110:1} The Priestly King A Davidic psalm.
{110:1} This is the declaration of the Lord to my Lord: “Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies Your footstool.”
{110:2} The Lord will extend Your mighty scepter from Zion. Rule over Your surrounding enemies.
{110:3} Your people will volunteer on Your day of battle. In holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn, the dew of Your youth belongs to You.
{110:4} The Lord has sworn an oath and will not take it back: “Forever, You are a priest like Melchizedek.”
{110:5} The Lord is at Your right hand; He will crush kings on the day of His anger.
{110:6} He will judge the nations, heaping up corpses; He will crush leaders over the entire world.
{110:7} He will drink from the brook by the road; therefore, He will lift up His head.
{i111:1} Praise for the Lord ’s Works
{111:1} Hallelujah! I will praise the Lord with all my heart in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation.
{111:2} The Lord’s works are great, studied by all who delight in them.
{111:3} All that He does is splendid and majestic; His righteousness endures forever.
{111:4} He has caused His wonderful works to be remembered. The Lord is gracious and compassionate.
{111:5} He has provided food for those who fear Him; He remembers His covenant forever.
{111:6} He has shown His people the power of His works by giving them the inheritance of the nations.
{111:7} The works of His hands are truth and justice; all His instructions are trustworthy.
{111:8} They are established forever and ever, enacted in truth and in what is right.
{111:9} He has sent redemption to His people. He has ordained His covenant forever. His name is holy and awe-inspiring.
{111:10} The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow His instructions have good insight. His praise endures forever.
{i112:1} The Traits of the Righteous
{112:1} Hallelujah! Happy is the man who fears the Lord, taking great delight in His commands.
{112:2} His descendants will be powerful in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.
{112:3} Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever.
{112:4} Light shines in the darkness for the upright. He is gracious, compassionate, and righteous.
{112:5} Good will come to a man who lends generously and conducts his business fairly.
{112:6} He will never be shaken. The righteous man will be remembered forever.
{112:7} He will not fear bad news; his heart is confident, trusting in the Lord.
{112:8} His heart is assured; he will not fear. In the end he will look in triumph on his foes.
{112:9} He distributes freely to the poor; his righteousness endures forever. His horn will be exalted in honor.
{112:10} The wicked man will see it and be angry; he will gnash his teeth in despair. The desire of the wicked man will come to nothing.
{i113:1} Praise to the Merciful God
{113:1} Hallelujah! Give praise, servants of Yahweh; praise the name of Yahweh.
{113:2} Let the name of Yahweh be praised both now and forever.
{113:3} From the rising of the sun to its setting, let the name of Yahweh be praised.
{113:4} Yahweh is exalted above all the nations, His glory above the heavens.
{113:5} Who is like Yahweh our God — the One enthroned on high,
{113:6} who stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth?
{113:7} He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the garbage pile
{113:8} in order to seat them with nobles — with the nobles of His people.
{113:9} He gives the childless woman a household, making her the joyful mother of children. Hallelujah!
{i114:1} God’s Deliverance of Israel
{114:1} When Israel came out of Egypt — the house of Jacob from a people who spoke a foreign language —
{114:2} Judah became His sanctuary, Israel, His dominion.
{114:3} The sea looked and fled; the Jordan turned back.
{114:4} The mountains skipped like rams, the hills, like lambs.
{114:5} Why was it, sea, that you fled? Jordan, that you turned back?
{114:6} Mountains, that you skipped like rams? Hills, like lambs?
{114:7} Tremble, earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
{114:8} who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of water.
{i115:1} Glory to God Alone
{115:1} Not to us, Yahweh, not to us, but to Your name give glory because of Your faithful love, because of Your truth.
{115:2} Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”
{115:3} Our God is in heaven and does whatever He pleases.
{115:4} Their idols are silver and gold, made by human hands.
{115:5} They have mouths but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see.
{115:6} They have ears but cannot hear, noses, but cannot smell.
{115:7} They have hands but cannot feel, feet, but cannot walk. They cannot make a sound with their throats.
{115:8} Those who make them are just like them, as are all who trust in them.
{115:9} Israel, trust in the Lord! He is their help and shield.
{115:10} House of Aaron, trust in the Lord! He is their help and shield.
{115:11} You who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord! He is their help and shield.
{115:12} The Lord remembers us and will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron;
{115:13} He will bless those who fear the Lord — small and great alike.
{115:14} May the Lord add to your numbers, both yours and your children’s.
{115:15} May you be blessed by the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.
{115:16} The heavens are the Lord’s, but the earth He has given to the human race.
{115:17} It is not the dead who praise the Lord, nor any of those descending into the silence of death.
{115:18} But we will praise the Lord, both now and forever. Hallelujah!
{i116:1} Thanks to God for Deliverance
{116:1} I love the Lord because He has heard my appeal for mercy.
{116:2} Because He has turned His ear to me, I will call out to Him as long as I live.
{116:3} The ropes of death were wrapped around me, and the torments of Sheol overcame me; I encountered trouble and sorrow.
{116:4} Then I called on the name of Yahweh: “Yahweh, save me!”
{116:5} The Lord is gracious and righteous; our God is compassionate.
{116:6} The Lord guards the inexperienced; I was helpless, and He saved me.
{116:7} Return to your rest, my soul, for the Lord has been good to you.
{116:8} For You, Lord, rescued me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.
{116:9} I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.
{116:10} I believed, even when I said, “I am severely afflicted.”
{116:11} In my alarm I said, “Everyone is a liar.”
{116:12} How can I repay the Lord for all the good He has done for me?
{116:13} I will take the cup of salvation and call on the name of Yahweh.
{116:14} I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the presence of all His people.
{116:15} The death of His faithful ones is valuable in the Lord’s sight.
{116:16} Lord, I am indeed Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your female servant. You have loosened my bonds.
{116:17} I will offer You a sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of Yahweh.
{116:18} I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the presence of all His people,
{116:19} in the courts of the Lord’s house — within you, Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
{i117:1} Universal Call to Praise
{117:1} Praise the Lord, all nations! Glorify Him, all peoples!

{122:1} I rejoiced with those who said to me, “Let us go to the house of the Lord.”
{122:2} Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem —
{122:3} Jerusalem, built as a city should be, solidly joined together,
{122:4} where the tribes, Yahweh’s tribes, go up to give thanks to the name of Yahweh. (This is an ordinance for Israel. )
{122:5} There, thrones for judgment are placed, thrones of the house of David.
{122:6} Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May those who love you prosper;
{122:7} may there be peace within your walls, prosperity within your fortresses.”
{122:8} Because of my brothers and friends, I will say, “Peace be with you.”

{123:4} We’ve had more than enough scorn from the arrogant and contempt from the proud.
{i124:1} The Lord Is on Our Side A Davidic song of ascents.
{124:1} If the Lord had not been on our side — let Israel say —
{124:2} If the Lord had not been on our side when men attacked us,
{124:3} then they would have swallowed us alive in their burning anger against us.
{124:4} Then the waters would have engulfed us; the torrent would have swept over us;
{124:5} the raging waters would have swept over us.
{124:6} Praise the Lord, who has not let us be ripped apart by their teeth.

{125:3} The scepter of the wicked will not remain over the land allotted to the righteous, so that the righteous will not apply their hands to injustice.
{125:4} Do what is good, Lord, to the good, to those whose hearts are upright.
{125:5} But as for those who turn aside to crooked ways, the Lord will banish them with the evildoers. Peace be with Israel.
{i126:1} Zion’s Restoration A song of ascents.
{126:1} When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream.
{126:2} Our mouths were filled with laughter then, and our tongues with shouts of joy. Then they said among the nations, “The Lord has done great things for them.”
{126:3} The Lord had done great things for us; we were joyful.
{126:4} Restore our fortunes, Lord, like watercourses in the Negev.
{126:5} Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy.
{126:6} Though one goes along weeping, carrying the bag of seed, he will surely come back with shouts of joy, carrying his sheaves.
{i127:1} The Blessing of the Lord A Solomonic song of ascents.
{127:1} Unless the Lord builds a house, its builders labor over it in vain; unless the Lord watches over a city, the watchman stays alert in vain.
{127:2} In vain you get up early and stay up late, working hard to have enough food — yes, He gives sleep to the one He loves.
{127:3} Sons are indeed a heritage from the Lord, children, a reward.
{127:4} Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the sons born in one’s youth.
{127:5} Happy is the man who has filled his quiver with them. Such men will never be put to shame when they speak with their enemies at the city gate.
{i128:1} Blessings for Those Who Fear God A song of ascents.
{128:1} How happy is everyone who fears the Lord, who walks in His ways!
{128:2} You will surely eat what your hands have worked for. You will be happy, and it will go well for you.
{128:3} Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house, your sons, like young olive trees around your table.
{128:4} In this very way the man who fears the Lord will be blessed.
{128:5} May the Lord bless you from Zion, so that you will see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life
{128:6} and will see your children’s children! Peace be with Israel.
{i129:1} Protection of the Oppressed A song of ascents.
{129:1} Since my youth they have often attacked me — let Israel say —
{129:2} Since my youth they have often attacked me, but they have not prevailed against me.
{129:3} Plowmen plowed over my back; they made their furrows long.
{129:4} The Lord is righteous; He has cut the ropes of the wicked.
{129:5} Let all who hate Zion be driven back in disgrace.
{129:6} Let them be like grass on the rooftops, which withers before it grows up
{129:7} and can’t even fill the hands of the reaper or the arms of the one who binds sheaves.
{129:8} Then none who pass by will say, “May the Lord’s blessing be on you.” We bless you in the name of Yahweh.
{i130:1} Awaiting Redemption A song of ascents.
{130:1} Out of the depths I call to You, Yahweh!
{130:2} Lord, listen to my voice; let Your ears be attentive to my cry for help.
{130:3} Yahweh, if You considered sins, Lord, who could stand?
{130:4} But with You there is forgiveness, so that You may be revered.
{130:5} I wait for Yahweh; I wait and put my hope in His word.
{130:6} I wait for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning — more than watchmen for the morning.
{130:7} Israel, put your hope in the Lord. For there is faithful love with the Lord, and with Him is redemption in abundance.
{130:8} And He will redeem Israel from all its sins.
{i131:1} A Childlike Spirit A Davidic song of ascents.
{131:1} Lord, my heart is not proud; my eyes are not haughty. I do not get involved with things too great or too difficult for me.
{131:2} Instead, I have calmed and quieted myself like a little weaned child with its mother; I am like a little child.
{131:3} Israel, put your hope in the Lord, both now and forever.
{i132:1} David and Zion Chosen A song of ascents.
{132:1} Lord, remember David and all the hardships he endured,
{132:2} and how he swore an oath to the Lord, making a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob:
{132:3} “I will not enter my house or get into my bed,
{132:4} I will not allow my eyes to sleep or my eyelids to slumber
{132:5} until I find a place for the Lord, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
{132:6} We heard of the ark in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar.
{132:7} Let us go to His dwelling place; let us worship at His footstool.
{132:8} Rise up, Lord, come to Your resting place, You and Your powerful ark.
{132:9} May Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and may Your godly people shout for joy.
{132:10} Because of Your servant David, do not reject Your anointed one.
{132:11} The Lord swore an oath to David, a promise He will not abandon: “I will set one of your descendants on your throne.
{132:12} If your sons keep My covenant and My decrees that I will teach them, their sons will also sit on your throne forever.”
{132:13} For the Lord has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His home:
{132:14} “This is My resting place forever; I will make My home here because I have desired it.
{132:15} I will abundantly bless its food; I will satisfy its needy with bread.
{132:16} I will clothe its priests with salvation, and its godly people will shout for joy.
{132:17} There I will make a horn grow for David; I have prepared a lamp for My anointed one.
{132:18} I will clothe his enemies with shame, but the crown he wears will be glorious.”
{i133:1} Living in Harmony A Davidic song of ascents.
{133:1} How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in harmony!
{133:2} It is like fine oil on the head, running down on the beard, running down Aaron’s beard onto his robes.
{133:3} It is like the dew of Hermon falling on the mountains of Zion. For there the Lord has appointed the blessing — life forevermore.
{i134:1} Call to Evening Worship A song of ascents.
{134:1} Now praise the Lord, all you servants of the Lord who stand in the Lord’s house at night!
{134:2} Lift up your hands in the holy place and praise the Lord!
{134:3} May the Lord, Maker of heaven and earth, bless you from Zion.
{i135:1} Yahweh Is Great
{135:1} Hallelujah! Praise the name of Yahweh. Give praise, you servants of Yahweh
{135:2} who stand in the house of Yahweh, in the courts of the house of our God.
{135:3} Praise Yahweh, for Yahweh is good; sing praise to His name, for it is delightful.
{135:4} For Yahweh has chosen Jacob for Himself, Israel as His treasured possession.
{135:5} For I know that Yahweh is great; our Lord is greater than all gods.
{135:6} Yahweh does whatever He pleases in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all the depths.
{135:7} He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings the wind from His storehouses.
{135:8} He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, both man and beast.
{135:9} He sent signs and wonders against you, Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his officials.
{135:10} He struck down many nations and slaughtered mighty kings:
{135:11} Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kings of Canaan.
{135:12} He gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to His people Israel.
{135:13} Yahweh, Your name endures forever, Your reputation, Yahweh, through all generations.
{135:14} For Yahweh will vindicate His people and have compassion on His servants.
{135:15} The idols of the nations are of silver and gold, made by human hands.
{135:16} They have mouths but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see.
{135:17} They have ears but cannot hear; indeed, there is no breath in their mouths.
{135:18} Those who make them are just like them, as are all who trust in them.
{135:19} House of Israel, praise Yahweh! House of Aaron, praise Yahweh!
{135:20} House of Levi, praise Yahweh! You who revere the Lord, praise the Lord!
{135:21} May the Lord be praised from Zion; He dwells in Jerusalem. Hallelujah!

{136:13} He divided the Red Sea His love is eternal.

{136:17} He struck down great kings His love is eternal.
{136:18} and slaughtered famous kings — His love is eternal.

{136:20} and Og king of Bashan — His love is eternal.
{136:21} and gave their land as an inheritance, His love is eternal.
{136:22} an inheritance to Israel His servant. His love is eternal.
{136:23} He remembered us in our humiliation His love is eternal.
{136:24} and rescued us from our foes. His love is eternal.
{136:25} He gives food to every creature. His love is eternal.
{136:26} Give thanks to the God of heaven! His love is eternal.
{i137:1} Lament of the Exiles
{137:1} By the rivers of Babylon — there we sat down and wept when we remembered Zion.
{137:2} There we hung up our lyres on the poplar trees,
{137:3} for our captors there asked us for songs, and our tormentors, for rejoicing: “Sing us one of the songs of Zion.”
{137:4} How can we sing the Lord’s song on foreign soil?
{137:5} If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill.
{137:6} May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not exalt Jerusalem as my greatest joy!
{137:7} Remember, Lord, what the Edomites said that day at Jerusalem: “Destroy it! Destroy it down to its foundations!”
{137:8} Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is the one who pays you back what you have done to us.
{137:9} Happy is he who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rocks.
{i138:1} A Thankful Heart Davidic.
{138:1} I will give You thanks with all my heart; I will sing Your praise before the heavenly beings.
{138:2} I will bow down toward Your holy temple and give thanks to Your name for Your constant love and truth. You have exalted Your name and Your promise above everything else.
{138:3} On the day I called, You answered me; You increased strength within me.
{138:4} All the kings on earth will give You thanks, Lord, when they hear what You have promised.
{138:5} They will sing of the Lord’s ways, for the Lord’s glory is great.
{138:6} Though the Lord is exalted, He takes note of the humble; but He knows the haughty from a distance.
{138:7} If I walk into the thick of danger, You will preserve my life from the anger of my enemies. You will extend Your hand; Your right hand will save me.
{138:8} The Lord will fulfill His purpose for me. Lord, Your love is eternal; do not abandon the work of Your hands.
{i139:1} The All-Knowing, Ever-Present God For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.
{139:1} Lord, You have searched me and known me.
{139:2} You know when I sit down and when I stand up; You understand my thoughts from far away.
{139:3} You observe my travels and my rest; You are aware of all my ways.
{139:4} Before a word is on my tongue, You know all about it, Lord.
{139:5} You have encircled me; You have placed Your hand on me.
{139:6} This extraordinary knowledge is beyond me. It is lofty; I am unable to reach it.
{139:7} Where can I go to escape Your Spirit? Where can I flee from Your presence?
{139:8} If I go up to heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, You are there.
{139:9} If I live at the eastern horizon or settle at the western limits,
{139:10} even there Your hand will lead me; Your right hand will hold on to me.
{139:11} If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me, and the light around me will be night” —
{139:12} even the darkness is not dark to You. The night shines like the day; darkness and light are alike to You.
{139:13} For it was You who created my inward parts; You knit me together in my mother’s womb.
{139:14} I will praise You because I have been remarkably and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful, and I know this very well.
{139:15} My bones were not hidden from You when I was made in secret, when I was formed in the depths of the earth.
{139:16} Your eyes saw me when I was formless; all my days were written in Your book and planned before a single one of them began.
{139:17} God, how difficult Your thoughts are for me to comprehend; how vast their sum is!
{139:18} If I counted them, they would outnumber the grains of sand; when I wake up, I am still with You.
{139:19} God, if only You would kill the wicked — you bloodthirsty men, stay away from me —
{139:20} who invoke You deceitfully. Your enemies swear by You falsely.
{139:21} Lord, don’t I hate those who hate You, and detest those who rebel against You?
{139:22} I hate them with extreme hatred; I consider them my enemies.
{139:23} Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my concerns.
{139:24} See if there is any offensive way in me; lead me in the everlasting way.
{i140:1} Prayer for Rescue For the choir director. A Davidic psalm.
{140:1} Rescue me, Lord, from evil men. Keep me safe from violent men
{140:2} who plan evil in their hearts. They stir up wars all day long.
{140:3} They make their tongues as sharp as a snake’s bite; viper’s venom is under their lips. Selah
{140:4} Protect me, Lord, from the clutches of the wicked. Keep me safe from violent men who plan to make me stumble.
{140:5} The proud hide a trap with ropes for me; they spread a net along the path and set snares for me. Selah
{140:6} I say to the Lord, “You are my God.” Listen, Lord, to my cry for help.
{140:7} Lord God, my strong Savior, You shield my head on the day of battle.
{140:8} Lord, do not grant the desires of the wicked; do not let them achieve their goals. Otherwise, they will become proud. Selah
{140:9} When those who surround me rise up, may the trouble their lips cause overwhelm them.
{140:10} Let hot coals fall on them. Let them be thrown into the fire, into the abyss, never again to rise.
{140:11} Do not let a slanderer stay in the land. Let evil relentlessly hunt down a violent man.
{140:12} I know that the Lord upholds the just cause of the poor, justice for the needy.
{140:13} Surely the righteous will praise Your name; the upright will live in Your presence.
{i141:1} Protection from Sin and Sinners A Davidic psalm.
{141:1} Lord, I call on You; hurry to help me. Listen to my voice when I call on You.
{141:2} May my prayer be set before You as incense, the raising of my hands as the evening offering.
{141:3} Lord, set up a guard for my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips.
{141:4} Do not let my heart turn to any evil thing or perform wicked acts with men who commit sin. Do not let me feast on their delicacies.
{141:5} Let the righteous one strike me — it is an act of faithful love; let him rebuke me — it is oil for my head; let me not refuse it. Even now my prayer is against the evil acts of the wicked.
{141:6} When their rulers will be thrown off the sides of a cliff, the people will listen to my words, for they are pleasing.
{141:7} As when one plows and breaks up the soil, turning up rocks, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
{141:8} But my eyes look to You, Lord God. I seek refuge in You; do not let me die.
{141:9} Protect me from the trap they have set for me, and from the snares of evildoers.
{141:10} Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by safely.
{i142:1} A Cry of Distress A Davidic Maskil . When he was in the cave. A prayer.
{142:1} I cry aloud to the Lord; I plead aloud to the Lord for mercy.
{142:2} I pour out my complaint before Him; I reveal my trouble to Him.
{142:3} Although my spirit is weak within me, You know my way. Along this path I travel they have hidden a trap for me.
{142:4} Look to the right and see: no one stands up for me; there is no refuge for me; no one cares about me.
{142:5} I cry to You, Lord; I say, “You are my shelter, my portion in the land of the living.”
{142:6} Listen to my cry, for I am very weak. Rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me.
{142:7} Free me from prison so that I can praise Your name. The righteous will gather around me because You deal generously with me.
{i143:1} A Cry for Help A Davidic psalm.
{143:1} Lord, hear my prayer. In Your faithfulness listen to my plea, and in Your righteousness answer me.
{143:2} Do not bring Your servant into judgment, for no one alive is righteous in Your sight.
{143:3} For the enemy has pursued me, crushing me to the ground, making me live in darkness like those long dead.
{143:4} My spirit is weak within me; my heart is overcome with dismay.
{143:5} I remember the days of old; I meditate on all You have done; I reflect on the work of Your hands.
{143:6} I spread out my hands to You; I am like parched land before You. Selah
{143:7} Answer me quickly, Lord; my spirit fails. Don’t hide Your face from me, or I will be like those going down to the Pit.
{143:8} Let me experience Your faithful love in the morning, for I trust in You. Reveal to me the way I should go because I long for You.
{143:9} Rescue me from my enemies, Lord; I come to You for protection.
{143:10} Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God. May Your gracious Spirit lead me on level ground.
{143:11} Because of Your name, Yahweh, let me live. In Your righteousness deliver me from trouble,
{143:12} and in Your faithful love destroy my enemies. Wipe out all those who attack me, for I am Your servant.
{i144:1} A King’s Prayer Davidic.
{144:1} May the Lord, my rock, be praised, who trains my hands for battle and my fingers for warfare.
{144:2} He is my faithful love and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer. He is my shield, and I take refuge in Him; He subdues my people under me.
{144:3} Lord, what is man, that You care for him, the son of man, that You think of him?
{144:4} Man is like a breath; his days are like a passing shadow.
{144:5} Lord, part Your heavens and come down. Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.
{144:6} Flash Your lightning and scatter the foe; shoot Your arrows and rout them.
{144:7} Reach down from heaven; rescue me from deep water, and set me free from the grasp of foreigners
{144:8} whose mouths speak lies, whose right hands are deceptive.
{144:9} God, I will sing a new song to You; I will play on a ten-stringed harp for You —
{144:10} the One who gives victory to kings, who frees His servant David from the deadly sword.
{144:11} Set me free and rescue me from the grasp of foreigners whose mouths speak lies, whose right hands are deceptive.
{144:12} Then our sons will be like plants nurtured in their youth, our daughters, like corner pillars that are carved in the palace style.
{144:13} Our storehouses will be full, supplying all kinds of produce; our flocks will increase by thousands and tens of thousands in our open fields.
{144:14} Our cattle will be well fed. There will be no breach in the walls, no going into captivity, and no cry of lament in our public squares.
{144:15} Happy are the people with such blessings. Happy are the people whose God is Yahweh.
{i145:1} Praising God’s Greatness A Davidic hymn.
{145:1} I exalt You, my God the King, and praise Your name forever and ever.
{145:2} I will praise You every day; I will honor Your name forever and ever.
{145:3} Yahweh is great and is highly praised; His greatness is unsearchable.
{145:4} One generation will declare Your works to the next and will proclaim Your mighty acts.
{145:5} I will speak of Your splendor and glorious majesty and Your wonderful works.
{145:6} They will proclaim the power of Your awe-inspiring acts, and I will declare Your greatness.
{145:7} They will give a testimony of Your great goodness and will joyfully sing of Your righteousness.
{145:8} The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in faithful love.
{145:9} The Lord is good to everyone; His compassion rests on all He has made.
{145:10} All You have made will thank You, Lord; the godly will praise You.
{145:11} They will speak of the glory of Your kingdom and will declare Your might,
{145:12} informing all people of Your mighty acts and of the glorious splendor of Your kingdom.
{145:13} Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom; Your rule is for all generations. The Lord is faithful in all His words and gracious in all His actions.
{145:14} The Lord helps all who fall; He raises up all who are oppressed.
{145:15} All eyes look to You, and You give them their food at the proper time.
{145:16} You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
{145:17} The Lord is righteous in all His ways and gracious in all His acts.
{145:18} The Lord is near all who call out to Him, all who call out to Him with integrity.
{145:19} He fulfills the desires of those who fear Him; He hears their cry for help and saves them.
{145:20} The Lord guards all those who love Him, but He destroys all the wicked.
{145:21} My mouth will declare Yahweh’s praise; let every living thing praise His holy name forever and ever.
{i146:1} The God of Compassion
{146:1} Hallelujah! My soul, praise the Lord.
{146:2} I will praise the Lord all my life; I will sing to my God as long as I live.
{146:3} Do not trust in nobles, in man, who cannot save.
{146:4} When his breath leaves him, he returns to the ground; on that day his plans die.
{146:5} Happy is the one whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God,
{146:6} the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea and everything in them. He remains faithful forever,
{146:7} executing justice for the exploited and giving food to the hungry. The Lord frees prisoners.
{146:8} The Lord opens the eyes of the blind. The Lord raises up those who are oppressed. The Lord loves the righteous.
{146:9} The Lord protects foreigners and helps the fatherless and the widow, but He frustrates the ways of the wicked.
{146:10} The Lord reigns forever; Zion, your God reigns for all generations. Hallelujah!
{i147:1} God Restores Jerusalem
{147:1} Hallelujah! How good it is to sing to our God, for praise is pleasant and lovely.
{147:2} The Lord rebuilds Jerusalem; He gathers Israel’s exiled people.
{147:3} He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.
{147:4} He counts the number of the stars; He gives names to all of them.
{147:5} Our Lord is great, vast in power; His understanding is infinite.
{147:6} The Lord helps the afflicted but brings the wicked to the ground.
{147:7} Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving; play the lyre to our God,
{147:8} who covers the sky with clouds, prepares rain for the earth, and causes grass to grow on the hills.
{147:9} He provides the animals with their food, and the young ravens, what they cry for.
{147:10} He is not impressed by the strength of a horse; He does not value the power of a man.
{147:11} The Lord values those who fear Him, those who put their hope in His faithful love.
{147:12} Exalt the Lord, Jerusalem; praise your God, Zion!
{147:13} For He strengthens the bars of your gates and blesses your children within you.
{147:14} He endows your territory with prosperity; He satisfies you with the finest wheat.
{147:15} He sends His command throughout the earth; His word runs swiftly.
{147:16} He spreads snow like wool; He scatters frost like ashes;
{147:17} He throws His hailstones like crumbs. Who can withstand His cold?
{147:18} He sends His word and melts them; He unleashes His winds, and the waters flow.
{147:19} He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and judgments to Israel.
{147:20} He has not done this for any nation; they do not know His judgments. Hallelujah!
{i148:1} Creation’s Praise of the Lord
{148:1} Hallelujah! Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise Him in the heights.
{148:2} Praise Him, all His angels; praise Him, all His hosts.

{148:4} Praise Him, highest heavens, and you waters above the heavens.
{148:5} Let them praise the name of Yahweh, for He commanded, and they were created.
{148:6} He set them in position forever and ever; He gave an order that will never pass away.
{148:7} Praise the Lord from the earth, all sea monsters and ocean depths,
{148:8} lightning and hail, snow and cloud, powerful wind that executes His command,
{148:9} mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars,
{148:10} wild animals and all cattle, creatures that crawl and flying birds,
{148:11} kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all judges of the earth,
{148:12} young men as well as young women, old and young together.
{148:13} Let them praise the name of Yahweh, for His name alone is exalted. His majesty covers heaven and earth.

{149:4} For Yahweh takes pleasure in His people; He adorns the humble with salvation.
{149:5} Let the godly celebrate in triumphal glory; let them shout for joy on their beds.
{149:6} Let the exaltation of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands,
{149:7} inflicting vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples,
{149:8} binding their kings with chains and their dignitaries with iron shackles,
{149:9} carrying out the judgment decreed against them. This honor is for all His godly people. Hallelujah!
{i150:1} Praise the Lord
{150:1} Hallelujah! Praise God in His sanctuary. Praise Him in His mighty heavens.
{150:2} Praise Him for His powerful acts; praise Him for His abundant greatness.
{150:3} Praise Him with trumpet blast; praise Him with harp and lyre.
{150:4} Praise Him with tambourine and dance; praise Him with flute and strings.
{150:5} Praise Him with resounding cymbals; praise Him with clashing cymbals.
{150:6} Let everything that breathes praise the Lord. Hallelujah!
