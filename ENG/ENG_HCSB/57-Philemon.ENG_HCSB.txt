{i1:1} Greeting
{1:1} Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother: To Philemon our dear friend and coworker,
{1:2} to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your home.
{1:3} Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
{i1:4} Philemon’s Love and Faith
{1:4} I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers,
{1:5} because I hear of your love and faith toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints.
{1:6} I pray that your participation in the faith may become effective through knowing every good thing that is in us for the glory of Christ.
{1:7} For I have great joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.
{i1:8} An Appeal for Onesimus
{1:8} For this reason, although I have great boldness in Christ to command you to do what is right,
{1:9} I appeal to you, instead, on the basis of love. I, Paul, as an elderly man and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus,
{1:10} appeal to you for my son, Onesimus. I fathered him while I was in chains.
{1:11} Once he was useless to you, but now he is useful both to you and to me.
{1:12} I am sending him back to you as a part of myself.
{1:13} I wanted to keep him with me, so that in my imprisonment for the gospel he might serve me in your place.
{1:14} But I didn’t want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed might not be out of obligation, but of your own free will.
{1:15} For perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a brief time, so that you might get him back permanently,
{1:16} no longer as a slave, but more than a slave — as a dearly loved brother. He is especially so to me, but even more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
{1:17} So if you consider me a partner, accept him as you would me.
{1:18} And if he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.
{1:19} I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it — not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self.
{1:20} Yes, brother, may I have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
{1:21} Since I am confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
{1:22} But meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.
{i1:23} Final Greetings
{1:23} Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, and so do
{1:24} Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my coworkers.
{1:25} The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
