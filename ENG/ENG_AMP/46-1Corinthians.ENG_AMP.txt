{1:1} Paul, called as an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,
{1:2} To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified (set apart, made holy) in Christ Jesus, who are selected and called as saints (God's people), together with all those who in every place call on and honor the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:
{1:3} Grace to you and peace [inner calm and spiritual well-being] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
{1:4} I thank my God always for you because of the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus,
{1:5} so that in everything you were [exceedingly] enriched in Him, in all speech [empowered by the spiritual gifts] and in all knowledge [with insight into the faith].
{1:6} In this way our testimony about Christ was confirmed and established in you,
{1:7} so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift [which comes from the Holy Spirit], as you eagerly wait [with confident trust] for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ [when He returns].
{1:8} And He will also confirm you to the end [keeping you strong and free of any accusation, so that you will be] blameless and beyond reproach in the day [of the return] of our Lord Jesus Christ.
{1:9} God is faithful [He is reliable, trustworthy and ever true to His promise -- He can be depended on], and through Him you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
{1:10} But I urge you, believers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in full agreement in what you say, and that there be no divisions or factions among you, but that you be perfectly united in your way of thinking and in your judgment [about matters of the faith].
{1:11} For I have been informed about you, my brothers and sisters, by those of Chloe's household, that there are quarrels and factions among you.
{1:12} Now I mean this, that each one of you says, “I am [a disciple] of Paul,” or “I am [a disciple] of Apollos,” or “I am [a disciple] of Cephas (Peter),” or “I am [a disciple] of Christ.”
{1:13} Has Christ been divided [into different parts]? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul? [Certainly not!]
{1:14} I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,
{1:15} so that no one would say that you were baptized into my name.
{1:16} Now I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know if I baptized anyone else.
{1:17} For Christ did not send me [as an apostle] to baptize, but [commissioned and empowered me] to preach the good news [of salvation] -- not with clever and eloquent speech [as an orator], so that the cross of Christ would not be made ineffective [deprived of its saving power].
{1:18} For the message of the cross is foolishness [absurd and illogical] to those who are perishing and spiritually dead [because they reject it], but to us who are being saved [by God's grace] it is [the manifestation of] the power of God.
{1:19} For it is written and forever remains written, “I WILL DESTROY THE WISDOM OF THE WISE [the philosophy of the philosophers], AND THE CLEVERNESS OF THE CLEVER [who do not know Me] I WILL NULLIFY.”
{1:20} Where is the wise man (philosopher)? Where is the scribe (scholar)? Where is the debater (logician, orator) of this age? Has God not exposed the foolishness of this world's wisdom?
{1:21} For since the world through all its [earthly] wisdom failed to recognize God, God in His wisdom was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached [regarding salvation] to save those who believe [in Christ and welcome Him as Savior].
{1:22} For Jews demand signs (attesting miracles), and Greeks pursue [worldly] wisdom and philosophy,
{1:23} but we preach Christ crucified, [a message which is] to Jews a stumbling block [that provokes their opposition], and to Gentiles foolishness [just utter nonsense],
{1:24} but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks (Gentiles), Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.
{1:25} [This is] because the foolishness of God [is not foolishness at all and] is wiser than men [far beyond human comprehension], and the weakness of God is stronger than men [far beyond the limits of human effort].
{1:26} Just look at your own calling, believers; not many [of you were considered] wise according to human standards, not many powerful or influential, not many of high and noble birth.
{1:27} But God has selected [for His purpose] the foolish things of the world to shame the wise [revealing their ignorance], and God has selected [for His purpose] the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong [revealing their frailty].
{1:28} God has selected [for His purpose] the insignificant (base) things of the world, and the things that are despised and treated with contempt, [even] the things that are nothing, so that He might reduce to nothing the things that are,
{1:29} so that no one may [be able to] boast in the presence of God.
{1:30} But it is from Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God [revealing His plan of salvation], and righteousness [making us acceptable to God], and sanctification [making us holy and setting us apart for God], and redemption [providing our ransom from the penalty for sin],
{1:31} so then, as it is written [in Scripture], “HE WHO BOASTS and GLORIES, LET HIM BOAST and GLORY IN THE LORD.”
{2:1} And when I came to you, brothers and sisters, proclaiming to you the testimony of God [concerning salvation through Christ], I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom [no lofty words of eloquence or of philosophy as a Greek orator might do];
{2:2} for I made the decision to know nothing [that is, to forego philosophical or theological discussions regarding inconsequential things and opinions while] among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified [and the meaning of His redemptive, substitutionary death and His resurrection].
{2:3} I came to you in [a state of] weakness and fear and great trembling.
{2:4} And my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom [using clever rhetoric], but [they were delivered] in demonstration of the [Holy] Spirit [operating through me] and of [His] power [stirring the minds of the listeners and persuading them],
{2:5} so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom and rhetoric of men, but on the power of God.
{2:6} Yet we do speak wisdom among those spiritually mature [believers who have teachable hearts and a greater understanding]; but [it is a higher] wisdom not [the wisdom] of this present age nor of the rulers and leaders of this age, who are passing away;
{2:7} but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom once hidden [from man, but now revealed to us by God, that wisdom] which God predestined before the ages to our glory [to lift us into the glory of His presence].
{2:8} None of the rulers of this age recognized and understood this wisdom; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;
{2:9} but just as it is written [in Scripture], “THINGS WHICH THE EYE HAS NOT SEEN AND THE EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND WHICH HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN, ALL THAT GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM [who hold Him in affectionate reverence, who obey Him, and who gratefully recognize the benefits that He has bestowed].”
{2:10} For God has unveiled them and revealed them to us through the [Holy] Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things [diligently], even [sounding and measuring] the [profound] depths of God [the divine counsels and things far beyond human understanding].
{2:11} For what person knows the thoughts and motives of a man except the man's spirit within him? So also no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
{2:12} Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the [Holy] Spirit who is from God, so that we may know and understand the [wonderful] things freely given to us by God.
{2:13} We also speak of these things, not in words taught or supplied by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining and interpreting spiritual thoughts with spiritual words [for those being guided by the Holy Spirit].
{2:14} But the natural [unbelieving] man does not accept the things [the teachings and revelations] of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness [absurd and illogical] to him; and he is incapable of understanding them, because they are spiritually discerned and appreciated, [and he is unqualified to judge spiritual matters].
{2:15} But the spiritual man [the spiritually mature Christian] judges all things [questions, examines and applies what the Holy Spirit reveals], yet is himself judged by no one [the unbeliever cannot judge and understand the believer's spiritual nature].
{2:16} For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND and PURPOSES OF THE LORD, SO AS TO INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ [to be guided by His thoughts and purposes].
{3:1} However, brothers and sisters, I could not talk to you as to spiritual people, but [only] as to worldly people [dominated by human nature], mere infants [in the new life] in Christ!
{3:2} I fed you with milk, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Even now you are still not ready.
{3:3} You are still worldly [controlled by ordinary impulses, the sinful capacity]. For as long as there is jealousy and strife and discord among you, are you not unspiritual, and are you not walking like ordinary men [unchanged by faith]?
{3:4} For when one of you says, “I am [a disciple] of Paul,” and another, “I am [a disciple] of Apollos,” are you not [proving yourselves unchanged, just] ordinary people?
{3:5} What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Just servants through whom you believed [in Christ], even as the Lord appointed to each his task.
{3:6} I planted, Apollos watered, but God [all the while] was causing the growth.
{3:7} So neither is the one who plants nor the one who waters anything, but [only] God who causes the growth.
{3:8} He who plants and he who waters are one [in importance and esteem, working toward the same purpose]; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.
{3:9} For we are God's fellow workers [His servants working together]; you are God's cultivated field [His garden, His vineyard], God's building.
{3:10} According to the [remarkable] grace of God which was given to me [to prepare me for my task], like a skillful master builder I laid a foundation, and now another is building on it. But each one must be careful how he builds on it,
{3:11} for no one can lay a foundation other than the one which is [already] laid, which is Jesus Christ.
{3:12} But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,
{3:13} each one's work will be clearly shown [for what it is]; for the day [of judgment] will disclose it, because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality and character and worth of each person's work.
{3:14} If any person's work which he has built [on this foundation, that is, any outcome of his effort] remains [and survives this test], he will receive a reward.
{3:15} But if any person's work is burned up [by the test], he will suffer the loss [of his reward]; yet he himself will be saved, but only as [one who has barely escaped] through fire.
{3:16} Do you not know and understand that you [the church] are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells [permanently] in you [collectively and individually]?
{3:17} If anyone destroys the temple of God [corrupting it with false doctrine], God will destroy the destroyer; for the temple of God is holy (sacred), and that is what you are.
{3:18} Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool [discarding his worldly pretensions and acknowledging his lack of wisdom], so that he may become [truly] wise.
{3:19} For the wisdom of this world is foolishness (absurdity, stupidity) before God; for it is written [in Scripture], “[He is] THE ONE WHO CATCHES THE WISE and CLEVER IN THEIR CRAFTINESS;”
{3:20} and again, “THE LORD KNOWS THE THOUGHTS of the [humanly] wise, THAT THEY ARE USELESS.”
{3:21} So let no one boast in men [about their wisdom, or of having this or that one as a leader]. For all things are yours,
{3:22} whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas (Peter) or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all things are yours,
{3:23} and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God.
{4:1} So then, let us [who minister] be regarded as servants of Christ and stewards (trustees, administrators) of the mysteries of God [that He chooses to reveal].
{4:2} In this case, moreover, it is required [as essential and demanded] of stewards that one be found faithful and trustworthy.
{4:3} But [as for me personally] it matters very little to me that I may be judged by you or any human court [on this point]; in fact, I do not even judge myself.
{4:4} I am aware of nothing against myself and I feel blameless, but I am not by this acquitted [before God]. It is the Lord who judges me.
{4:5} So do not go on passing judgment before the appointed time, but wait until the Lord comes, for He will both bring to light the [secret] things that are hidden in darkness and disclose the motives of the hearts. Then each one's praise will come from God.
{4:6} Now I have applied these things [that is, the analogies about factions] to myself and Apollos for your benefit, believers, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written [in Scripture], so that none of you will become arrogant and boast in favor of one [minister or teacher] against the other.
{4:7} For who regards you as superior or what sets you apart as special? What do you have that you did not receive [from another]? And if in fact you received it [from God or someone else], why do you boast as if you had not received it [but had gained it by yourself]?
{4:8} [You behave as if] you are already filled [with spiritual wisdom and in need of nothing more]. Already you have become rich [in spiritual gifts]! You [in your conceit] have ascended your thrones and become kings without us; and how I wish [that it were true and] that you did reign as kings, so that we might reign with you.
{4:9} For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles at the end of the line, like men sentenced to death [and paraded as prisoners in a procession], because we have become a spectacle to the world [a show in the world's amphitheater], both to angels and to men.
{4:10} We are [regarded as] fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are highly esteemed, but we are dishonored.
{4:11} To this present hour we are both hungry and thirsty; we are continually poorly dressed, and we are roughly treated, and wander homeless.
{4:12} We work [for our living], working hard with our own hands. When we are reviled and verbally abused, we bless. When we are persecuted, we take it patiently and endure.
{4:13} When we are slandered, we try to be conciliatory and answer softly. We have become like the scum of the world, the dregs of all things, even until now.
{4:14} I do not write these things to shame you, but to warn and advise you as my beloved children.
{4:15} For even if you were to have ten thousand teachers [to guide you] in Christ, yet you would not have many fathers [who led you to Christ and assumed responsibility for you], for I became your father in Christ Jesus through the good news [of salvation].
{4:16} So I urge you, be imitators of me [just as a child imitates his father].
{4:17} For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my way of life in Christ [my conduct and my precepts for godly living], just as I teach everywhere in every church.
{4:18} Now some of you have become arrogant and pretentious, as though I were not coming to see you.
{4:19} But I will come to you soon, if the Lord is willing, and I will find out not just the talk of these arrogant people, but [evaluate] their [spiritual] power [whether they live up to their own claims].
{4:20} For the kingdom of God is not based on talk but on power.
{4:21} Which do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod [of discipline and correction], or with love and a gentle spirit?
{5:1} It is actually reported [everywhere] that there is sexual immorality among you, a kind of immorality that is condemned even among the [unbelieving] Gentiles: that someone has [an intimate relationship with] his father's wife.
{5:2} And you are proud and arrogant! You should have mourned in shame so that the man who has done this [disgraceful] thing would be removed from your fellowship!
{5:3} For I, though absent [from you] in body but present in spirit, have already passed judgment on him who has committed this [act], as if I were present.
{5:4} In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and I am with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
{5:5} you are to hand over this man to Satan for the destruction of his body, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
{5:6} Your boasting [over the supposed spirituality of your church] is not good [indeed, it is vulgar and inappropriate]. Do you not know that [just] a little leaven ferments the whole batch [of dough, just as a little sin corrupts a person or an entire church]?
{5:7} Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new batch, just as you are, still unleavened. For Christ our Passover Lamb has been sacrificed.
{5:8} Therefore, let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of vice and malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and [untainted] truth.
{5:9} I wrote you in my [previous] letter not to associate with [sexually] immoral people --
{5:10} not meaning the immoral people of this world, or the greedy ones and swindlers, or idolaters, for then you would have to get out of the world and human society altogether!
{5:11} But actually, I have written to you not to associate with any so-called [Christian] brother if he is sexually immoral or greedy, or is an idolater [devoted to anything that takes the place of God], or is a reviler [who insults or slanders or otherwise verbally abuses others], or is a drunkard or a swindler -- you must not so much as eat with such a person.
{5:12} For what business is it of mine to judge outsiders (non-believers)? Do you not judge those who are within the church [to protect the church as the situation requires]?
{5:13} God alone sits in judgment on those who are outside [the faith]. REMOVE THE WICKED ONE FROM AMONG YOU [expel him from your church].
{6:1} Does any one of you, when he has a complaint (civil dispute) with another [believer], dare to go to law before unrighteous men (non-believers) instead of [placing the issue] before the saints (God's people)?
{6:2} Do you not know that the saints (God's people) will [one day] judge the world? If the world is to be judged by you, are you not competent to try trivial (insignificant, petty) cases?
{6:3} Do you not know that we [believers] will judge angels? How much more then [as to] matters of this life?
{6:4} So if you have lawsuits dealing with matters of this life, are you appointing those as judges [to hear disputes] who are of no account in the church?
{6:5} I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is not one wise man among you who [is governed by integrity and] will be able and competent to decide [private disputes] between his fellow believers,
{6:6} but instead, brother goes to law against brother, and that before [judges who are] unbelievers?
{6:7} Why, the very fact that you have lawsuits with one another is already a defeat. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?
{6:8} On the contrary, it is you who wrong and defraud, and you do this even to your brothers and sisters.
{6:9} Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate [by perversion], nor those who participate in homosexuality,
{6:10} nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers [whose words are used as weapons to abuse, insult, humiliate, intimidate, or slander], nor swindlers will inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God.
{6:11} And such were some of you [before you believed]. But you were washed [by the atoning sacrifice of Christ], you were sanctified [set apart for God, and made holy], you were justified [declared free of guilt] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the [Holy] Spirit of our God [the source of the believer's new life and changed behavior].
{6:12} Everything is permissible for me, but not all things are beneficial. Everything is permissible for me, but I will not be enslaved by anything [and brought under its power, allowing it to control me].
{6:13} Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food, but God will do away with both of them. The body is not intended for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body [to save, sanctify, and raise it again because of the sacrifice of the cross].
{6:14} And God has not only raised the Lord [to life], but will also raise us up by His power.
{6:15} Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Am I therefore to take the members of Christ and make them part of a prostitute? Certainly not!
{6:16} Do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, “THE TWO SHALL BE ONE FLESH.”
{6:17} But the one who is united and joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.
{6:18} Run away from sexual immorality [in any form, whether thought or behavior, whether visual or written]. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the one who is sexually immoral sins against his own body.
{6:19} Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is within you, whom you have [received as a gift] from God, and that you are not your own [property]?
{6:20} You were bought with a price [you were actually purchased with the precious blood of Jesus and made His own]. So then, honor and glorify God with your body.
{7:1} Now as to the matters of which you wrote: It is good (beneficial, advantageous) for a man not to touch a woman [outside marriage].
{7:2} But because of [the temptation to participate in] sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.
{7:3} The husband must fulfill his [marital] duty to his wife [with good will and kindness], and likewise the wife to her husband.
{7:4} The wife does not have [exclusive] authority over her own body, but the husband shares with her; and likewise the husband does not have [exclusive] authority over his body, but the wife shares with him.
{7:5} Do not deprive each other [of marital rights], except perhaps by mutual consent for a time, so that you may devote yourselves [unhindered] to prayer, but come together again so that Satan will not tempt you [to sin] because of your lack of self-control.
{7:6} But I am saying this as a concession, not as a command.
{7:7} I wish that all the people were as I am; but each person has his own gift from God, one of this kind and one of that.
{7:8} But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, [that as a practical matter] it is good if they remain [single and entirely devoted to the Lord] as I am.
{7:9} But if they do not have [sufficient] self-control, they should marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
{7:10} But to the married [believers] I give instructions -- not I, but the Lord -- that the wife is not to separate from her husband,
{7:11} (but even if she does leave him, let her remain single or else be reconciled to her husband) and that the husband should not leave his wife.
{7:12} To the rest I declare -- I, not the Lord [since Jesus did not discuss this] -- that if any [believing] brother has a wife who does not believe [in Christ], and she consents to live with him, he must not leave her.
{7:13} And if any [believing] woman has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to live with her, she must not leave him.
{7:14} For the unbelieving husband is sanctified [that is, he receives the blessings granted] through his [Christian] wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be [ceremonially] unclean, but as it is they are holy.
{7:15} But if the unbelieving partner leaves, let him leave. In such cases the [remaining] brother or sister is not [spiritually or morally] bound. But God has called us to peace.
{7:16} For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband [by leading him to Christ]? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife [by leading her to Christ]?
{7:17} Only, let each one live the life which the Lord has assigned him, and to which God has called him [for each person is unique and is accountable for his choices and conduct, let him walk in this way]. This is the rule I make in all the churches.
{7:18} Was anyone at the time of his calling [from God already] circumcised? He is not to become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called while uncircumcised? He is not to be circumcised.
{7:19} Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but what matters is keeping the commandments of God.
{7:20} Each one should remain in the condition in which he was [when he was] called.
{7:21} Were you a slave when you were called? Do not worry about that [since your status as a believer is equal to that of a freeborn believer]; but if you are able to gain your freedom, do that.
{7:22} For he who was a slave when he was called in the Lord is a freedman of the Lord, likewise he who was free when he was called is a slave of Christ.
{7:23} You were bought with a price [a precious price paid by Christ]; do not become slaves to men [but to Christ].
{7:24} Brothers, let each one remain with God in that condition in which he was [when he was] called.
{7:25} Now concerning the virgins [of marriageable age] I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.
{7:26} I think then that because of the impending distress [that is, the pressure of the current trouble], it is good for a man to remain as he is.
{7:27} Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you unmarried? Do not seek a wife.
{7:28} But if you do marry, you have not sinned [in doing so]; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned [in doing so]. Yet those [who marry] will have troubles (special challenges) in this life, and I am trying to spare you that.
{7:29} But I say this, believers: the time has been shortened, so that from now on even those who have wives should be as though they did not;
{7:30} and those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess [anything];
{7:31} and those who use the world [taking advantage of its opportunities], as though they did not make full use of it. For the outward form of this world [its present social and material nature] is passing away.
{7:32} But I want you to be free from concern. The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;
{7:33} but the married man is concerned about worldly things, how he may please his wife,
{7:34} and his interests are divided. The unmarried woman or the virgin is concerned about the matters of the Lord, how to be holy and set apart both in body and in spirit; but a married woman is concerned about worldly things, how she may please her husband.
{7:35} Now I say this for your own benefit; not to restrict you, but to promote what is appropriate and secure undistracted devotion to the Lord.
{7:36} But if any man thinks that he is not acting properly and honorably toward his virgin daughter, [by not permitting her to marry], if she is past her youth, and it must be so, let him do as he wishes, he does not sin; let her marry.
{7:37} But the man who stands firmly committed in his heart, having no compulsion [to yield to his daughter's request], and has authority over his own will, and has decided in his own heart to keep his own virgin [daughter from being married], he will do well.
{7:38} So then both the father who gives his virgin daughter in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better.
{7:39} A wife is bound [to her husband by law] as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry whomever she wishes, only [provided that he too is] in the Lord.
{7:40} But in my opinion a widow is happier if she stays as she is. And I think that I also have the Spirit of God [in this matter].
{8:1} Now about food sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge [concerning this]. Knowledge [alone] makes [people self-righteously] arrogant, but love [that unselfishly seeks the best for others] builds up and encourages others to grow [in wisdom].
{8:2} If anyone imagines that he knows and understands anything [of divine matters, without love], he has not yet known as he ought to know.
{8:3} But if anyone loves God [with awe-filled reverence, obedience and gratitude], he is known by Him [as His very own and is greatly loved].
{8:4} In this matter, then, of eating food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world [it has no real existence], and that there is no God but one.
{8:5} For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords,
{8:6} yet for us there is but one God, the Father, who is the source of all things, and we exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things [that have been created], and we [believers exist and have life and have been redeemed] through Him.
{8:7} However, not all [believers] have this knowledge. But some, being accustomed [throughout their lives] to [thinking of] the idol until now [as real and living], still eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol; and because their conscience is weak, it is defiled (guilty, ashamed).
{8:8} Now food will not commend us to God nor bring us close to Him; we are no worse off if we do not eat, nor are we better if we do eat.
{8:9} Only be careful that this liberty of yours [this power to choose] does not somehow become a stumbling block [that is, a temptation to sin] to the weak [in conscience].
{8:10} For if someone sees you, a person having knowledge, eating in an idol's temple, then if he is weak, will he not be encouraged to eat things sacrificed to idols [and violate his own convictions]?
{8:11} For through your knowledge (spiritual maturity) this weak man is ruined [that is, he suffers in his spiritual life], the brother for whom Christ died.
{8:12} And when you sin against the brothers and sisters in this way and wound their weak conscience [by confusing them], you sin against Christ.
{8:13} Therefore, if [my eating a certain] food causes my brother to stumble (sin), I will not eat [such] meat ever again, so that I will not cause my brother to stumble.
{9:1} Am I not free [unrestrained and exempt from any obligation]? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our [risen] Lord [in person]? Are you not [the result and proof of] my work in the Lord?
{9:2} If I am not [considered] an apostle to others, at least I am one to you; for you are the seal and the certificate and the living evidence of my apostleship in the Lord [confirming and authenticating it].
{9:3} This is my defense to those who would put me on trial and interrogate me [concerning my authority as an apostle]:
{9:4} Have we not the right to our food and drink [at the expense of the churches]?
{9:5} Have we not the right to take along with us a believing wife, as do the rest of the apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas (Peter)?
{9:6} Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to stop doing manual labor [in order to support our ministry]?
{9:7} [Consider this:] Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not use the milk of the flock?
{9:8} Do I say these things only from a man's perspective? Does the Law not endorse the same principles?
{9:9} For it is written in the Law of Moses, “YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE AN OX WHILE IT IS TREADING OUT THE GRAIN [to keep it from eating the grain].” Is it [only] for oxen that God cares?
{9:10} Or does He speak entirely for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake: The plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing the harvest.
{9:11} If we have sown [the good seed of] spiritual things in you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?
{9:12} If others share in this rightful claim over you, do not we even more? However, we did not exercise this right, but we put up with everything so that we will not hinder [the spread of] the good news of Christ.
{9:13} Do you not know that those who officiate in the sacred services of the temple eat from the temple [offerings of meat and bread] and those who regularly attend the altar have their share from the [offerings brought to the] altar?
{9:14} So also [on the same principle] the Lord directed those who preach the gospel to get their living from the gospel.
{9:15} But I have used none of these privileges, nor am I writing this [to suggest] that any such provision be made for me now. For it would be better for me to die than to have anyone deprive me of my boast [in this matter of financial support].
{9:16} For if I [merely] preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast about, for I am compelled [that is, absolutely obligated to do it]. Woe to me if I do not preach the good news [of salvation]!
{9:17} For if I do this work of my own free will, then I have a reward; but if it is not of my will [but by God's choosing], I have been entrusted with a [sacred] stewardship.
{9:18} What then is my reward? [Just this:] that, when I preach the gospel, I may offer the gospel without charge [to everyone], so as not to take advantage of my rights [as a preacher and apostle] in [preaching] the gospel.
{9:19} For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to everyone, so that I may win more [for Christ].
{9:20} To the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might win Jews [for Christ]; to men under the Law, [I became] as one under the Law, though not being under the Law myself, so that I might win those who are under the Law.
{9:21} To those who are without (outside) the Law, [I became] as one without the Law, though [I am] not without the law of God, but under the law of Christ, so that I might win those who are without law.
{9:22} To the weak I became [as the] weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all men, so that I may by all means [in any and every way] save some [by leading them to faith in Jesus Christ].
{9:23} And I do all this for the sake of the gospel, so that I may share in its blessings along with you.
{9:24} Do you not know that in a race all the runners run [their very best to win], but only one receives the prize? Run [your race] in such a way that you may seize the prize and make it yours!
{9:25} Now every athlete who [goes into training and] competes in the games is disciplined and exercises self-control in all things. They do it to win a crown that withers, but we [do it to receive] an imperishable [crown that cannot wither].
{9:26} Therefore I do not run without a definite goal; I do not flail around like one beating the air [just shadow boxing].
{9:27} But [like a boxer] I strictly discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached [the gospel] to others, I myself will not somehow be disqualified [as unfit for service].
{10:1} For I do not want you to be unaware, believers, that our fathers were all under the cloud [in which God's presence went before them] and they all passed [miraculously and safely] through the [Red] Sea;
{10:2} And all [of them] were baptized into Moses [into his safekeeping as their leader] in the cloud and in the sea;
{10:3} and all [of them] ate the same spiritual food;
{10:4} and all [of them] drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.
{10:5} Nevertheless, God was not well-pleased with most of them, for they were scattered along the ground in the wilderness [because their lack of self-control led to disobedience which led to death].
{10:6} Now these things [the warnings and admonitions] took place as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they did.
{10:7} Do not be worshipers of handmade gods, as some of them were; just as it is written [in Scripture], “THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK [after sacrificing to the golden calf at Horeb], AND STOOD UP TO PLAY [indulging in immoral activities].”
{10:8} We must not indulge in [nor tolerate] sexual immorality, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand [suddenly] fell [dead] in a single day!
{10:9} We must not tempt the Lord [that is, test His patience, question His purpose or exploit His goodness], as some of them did -- and they were killed by serpents.
{10:10} And do not murmur [in unwarranted discontent], as some of them did -- and were destroyed by the destroyer.
{10:11} Now these things happened to them as an example and warning [to us]; they were written for our instruction [to admonish and equip us], upon whom the ends of the ages have come.
{10:12} Therefore let the one who thinks he stands firm [immune to temptation, being overconfident and self-righteous], take care that he does not fall [into sin and condemnation].
{10:13} No temptation [regardless of its source] has overtaken or enticed you that is not common to human experience [nor is any temptation unusual or beyond human resistance]; but God is faithful [to His word -- He is compassionate and trustworthy], and He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability [to resist], but along with the temptation He [has in the past and is now and] will [always] provide the way out as well, so that you will be able to endure it [without yielding, and will overcome temptation with joy].
{10:14} Therefore, my beloved, run [keep far, far away] from [any sort of] idolatry [and that includes loving anything more than God, or participating in anything that leads to sin and enslaves the soul].
{10:15} I am speaking as to wise and sensible people; judge [carefully and thoughtfully consider] for yourselves what I say.
{10:16} Is the cup of blessing which we bless [at the Lord's Supper] not a sharing in the blood of Christ? [Indeed it is.] Is the bread which we break not a sharing in the body of Christ? [Indeed it is.]
{10:17} Since there is one bread, we [believers] who are many are [united into] one body; for we all partake of the one bread [which represents the body of Christ].
{10:18} Consider the people of Israel; are those who eat the sacrifices not partners of the altar [united in their worship of the same God]? [Indeed they are.]
{10:19} What do I mean then? That a thing offered to idols is anything [special or changed simply because it is offered], or that an idol is anything?
{10:20} On the contrary, the things which the Gentiles (pagans) sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons [in effect], and not to God; and I do not want you to become partners with demons [by eating at feasts in pagan temples].
{10:21} You cannot drink [both] the Lord's cup and the cup of demons. You cannot share in both the Lord's table and the table of demons [thereby becoming partners with them].
{10:22} Do we [really] provoke the Lord to jealousy [when we eat food sacrificed to handmade “gods” at pagan feasts]? Are we [spiritually] stronger than He? [Certainly not! He knows that the idols are nothing. But we deeply offend Him.]
{10:23} All things are lawful [that is, morally legitimate, permissible], but not all things are beneficial or advantageous. All things are lawful, but not all things are constructive [to character] and edifying [to spiritual life].
{10:24} Let no one seek [only] his own good, but [also] that of the other person.
{10:25} [Regarding meat offered to idols:] Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without asking any questions for the sake of your conscience,
{10:26} FOR THE [whole] EARTH IS THE LORD's, AND EVERYTHING THAT IS IN IT.
{10:27} If one of the unbelievers invites you [to a meal at his home] and you want to go, eat whatever is served to you without asking questions [about its source] for the sake of your conscience.
{10:28} But if anyone says to you, “This meat has been offered in sacrifice to an idol,” do not eat it, out of consideration for the one who told you, and for conscience's sake --
{10:29} and by conscience I mean for the sake of the other man's, not yours. For why is my freedom [of choice] judged by another's conscience [another's ethics -- another's sense of right and wrong]?
{10:30} If I take my share [of food] with thankfulness, why am I accused because of something for which I give thanks?
{10:31} So then, whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of [our great] God.
{10:32} Do not offend Jews or Greeks or even the church of God [but live to honor Him];
{10:33} just as I please everyone in all things [as much as possible adapting myself to the interests of others], not seeking my own benefit but that of the many, so that they [will be open to the message of salvation and] may be saved.
{11:1} Imitate me, just as I imitate Christ.
{11:2} I praise and appreciate you because you remember me in everything and you firmly hold to the traditions [the substance of my instructions], just as I have passed them on to you.
{11:3} But I want you to understand that Christ is the head (authority over) of every man, and man is the head of woman, and God is the head of Christ.
{11:4} Every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head dishonors his head [and the One who is his head].
{11:5} And every woman who prays or prophesies when she has her head uncovered disgraces her head; for she is one and the same as the woman whose head is shaved [in disgrace].
{11:6} If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, she should cover her head.
{11:7} A man ought not have his head covered [during worship], since he is the image and [reflected] glory of God; but the woman is [the expression of] man's glory.
{11:8} For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man;
{11:9} for indeed man was not created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man.
{11:10} Therefore the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head, for the sake of the angels [so as not to offend them].
{11:11} Nevertheless, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.
{11:12} For as the woman originates from the man, so also man is born through the woman; and all things [whether male or female] originate from God [as their Creator].
{11:13} Judge for yourselves; is it proper for a woman to offer prayer to God [publicly] with her head uncovered?
{11:14} Does not common sense itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,
{11:15} but if a woman has long hair, it is her ornament and glory? For her long hair is given to her as a covering.
{11:16} Now if anyone is inclined to be contentious [about this], we have no other practice [in worship than this], nor do the churches of God [in general].
{11:17} But in giving this next instruction, I do not praise you, because when you meet together it is not for the better but for the worse.
{11:18} For, in the first place, when you meet together in church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and in part I believe it,
{11:19} for [doubtless] there have to be factions among you, so that those who are of approved character may be clearly recognized among you.
{11:20} So when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper,
{11:21} for when you eat, each one hurries to get his own supper first [not waiting for others or the poor]. So one goes hungry while another gets drunk.
{11:22} What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you show contempt for the church of God and humiliate those [impoverished believers] who have nothing? What will I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? In this I will not praise you!
{11:23} For I received from the Lord Himself that [instruction] which I passed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which He was betrayed took bread;
{11:24} and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is (represents) My body, which is [offered as a sacrifice] for you. Do this in [affectionate] remembrance of Me.”
{11:25} In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant [ratified and established] in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in [affectionate] remembrance of Me.”
{11:26} For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are [symbolically] proclaiming [the fact of] the Lord's death until He comes [again].
{11:27} So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a way that is unworthy [of Him] will be guilty of [profaning and sinning against] the body and blood of the Lord.
{11:28} But a person must [prayerfully] examine himself [and his relationship to Christ], and only when he has done so should he eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
{11:29} For anyone who eats and drinks [without solemn reverence and heartfelt gratitude for the sacrifice of Christ], eats and drinks a judgment on himself if he does not recognize the body [of Christ].
{11:30} That [careless and unworthy participation] is the reason why many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep [in death].
{11:31} But if we evaluated and judged ourselves honestly [recognizing our shortcomings and correcting our behavior], we would not be judged.
{11:32} But when we [fall short and] are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined [by undergoing His correction] so that we will not be condemned [to eternal punishment] along with the world.
{11:33} So then, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat [the Lord's Supper], wait for one another [and see to it that no one is left out].
{11:34} If anyone is too hungry [to wait], let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment [on yourselves]. About the remaining matters [of which I was informed], I will take care of them when I come.
{12:1} Now about the spiritual gifts [the special endowments given by the Holy Spirit], brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed.
{12:2} You know that when you were pagans, you were led off after speechless idols; however you were led off [whether by impulse or habit].
{12:3} Therefore I want you to know that no one speaking by the [power and influence of the] Spirit of God can say, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is [my] Lord,” except by [the power and influence of] the Holy Spirit.
{12:4} Now there are [distinctive] varieties of spiritual gifts [special abilities given by the grace and extraordinary power of the Holy Spirit operating in believers], but it is the same Spirit [who grants them and empowers believers].
{12:5} And there are [distinctive] varieties of ministries and service, but it is the same Lord [who is served].
{12:6} And there are [distinctive] ways of working [to accomplish things], but it is the same God who produces all things in all believers [inspiring, energizing, and empowering them].
{12:7} But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit [the spiritual illumination and the enabling of the Holy Spirit] for the common good.
{12:8} To one is given through the [Holy] Spirit [the power to speak] the message of wisdom, and to another [the power to express] the word of knowledge and understanding according to the same Spirit;
{12:9} to another [wonder-working] faith [is given] by the same [Holy] Spirit, and to another the [extraordinary] gifts of healings by the one Spirit;
{12:10} and to another the working of miracles, and to another prophecy [foretelling the future, speaking a new message from God to the people], and to another discernment of spirits [the ability to distinguish sound, godly doctrine from the deceptive doctrine of man-made religions and cults], to another various kinds of [unknown] tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues.
{12:11} All these things [the gifts, the achievements, the abilities, the empowering] are brought about by one and the same [Holy] Spirit, distributing to each one individually just as He chooses.
{12:12} For just as the body is one and yet has many parts, and all the parts, though many, form [only] one body, so it is with Christ.
{12:13} For by one [Holy] Spirit we were all baptized into one body, [spiritually transformed -- united together] whether Jews or Greeks (Gentiles), slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one [Holy] Spirit [since the same Holy Spirit fills each life].
{12:14} For the [human] body does not consist of one part, but of many [limbs and organs].
{12:15} If the foot says, “Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,” is it not on the contrary still a part of the body?
{12:16} If the ear says, “Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body,” is it not on the contrary still a part of the body?
{12:17} If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole [body] were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
{12:18} But now [as things really are], God has placed and arranged the parts in the body, each one of them, just as He willed and saw fit [with the best balance of function].
{12:19} If they all were a single organ, where would [the rest of] the body be?
{12:20} But now [as things really are] there are many parts [different limbs and organs], but a single body.
{12:21} The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”
{12:22} But quite the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are [absolutely] necessary;
{12:23} and as for those parts of the body which we consider less honorable, these we treat with greater honor; and our less presentable parts are treated with greater modesty,
{12:24} while our more presentable parts do not require it. But God has combined the [whole] body, giving greater honor to that part which lacks it,
{12:25} so that there would be no division or discord in the body [that is, lack of adaptation of the parts to each other], but that the parts may have the same concern for one another.
{12:26} And if one member suffers, all the parts share the suffering; if one member is honored, all rejoice with it.
{12:27} Now you [collectively] are Christ's body, and individually [you are] members of it [each with his own special purpose and function].
{12:28} So God has appointed and placed in the church [for His own use]: first apostles [chosen by Christ], second prophets [those who foretell the future, those who speak a new message from God to the people], third teachers, then those who work miracles, then those with the gifts of healings, the helpers, the administrators, and speakers in various kinds of [unknown] tongues.
{12:29} Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles?
{12:30} Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
{12:31} But earnestly desire and strive for the greater gifts [if acquiring them is going to be your goal].  And yet I will show you a still more excellent way [one of the choicest graces and the highest of them all: unselfish love].
{13:1} If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love [for others growing out of God's love for me], then I have become only a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal [just an annoying distraction].
{13:2} And if I have the gift of prophecy [and speak a new message from God to the people], and understand all mysteries, and [possess] all knowledge; and if I have all [sufficient] faith so that I can remove mountains, but do not have love [reaching out to others], I am nothing.
{13:3} If I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it does me no good at all.
{13:4} Love endures with patience and serenity, love is kind and thoughtful, and is not jealous or envious; love does not brag and is not proud or arrogant.
{13:5} It is not rude; it is not self-seeking, it is not provoked [nor overly sensitive and easily angered]; it does not take into account a wrong endured.
{13:6} It does not rejoice at injustice, but rejoices with the truth [when right and truth prevail].
{13:7} Love bears all things [regardless of what comes], believes all things [looking for the best in each one], hopes all things [remaining steadfast during difficult times], endures all things [without weakening].
{13:8} Love never fails [it never fades nor ends]. But as for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for the gift of special knowledge, it will pass away.
{13:9} For we know in part, and we prophesy in part [for our knowledge is fragmentary and incomplete].
{13:10} But when that which is complete and perfect comes, that which is incomplete and partial will pass away.
{13:11} When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things.
{13:12} For now [in this time of imperfection] we see in a mirror dimly [a blurred reflection, a riddle, an enigma], but then [when the time of perfection comes we will see reality] face to face. Now I know in part [just in fragments], but then I will know fully, just as I have been fully known [by God].
{13:13} And now there remain: faith [abiding trust in God and His promises], hope [confident expectation of eternal salvation], love [unselfish love for others growing out of God's love for me], these three [the choicest graces]; but the greatest of these is love.
{14:1} Pursue [this] love [with eagerness, make it your goal], yet earnestly desire and cultivate the spiritual gifts [to be used by believers for the benefit of the church], but especially that you may prophesy [to foretell the future, to speak a new message from God to the people].
{14:2} For one who speaks in an unknown tongue does not speak to people but to God; for no one understands him or catches his meaning, but by the Spirit he speaks mysteries [secret truths, hidden things].
{14:3} But [on the other hand] the one who prophesies speaks to people for edification [to promote their spiritual growth] and [speaks words of] encouragement [to uphold and advise them concerning the matters of God] and [speaks words of] consolation [to compassionately comfort them].
{14:4} One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but one who prophesies edifies the church [promotes growth in spiritual wisdom, devotion, holiness, and joy].
{14:5} Now I wish that all of you spoke in unknown tongues, but even more [I wish] that you would prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater [and more useful] than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he translates or explains [what he says], so that the church may be edified [instructed, improved, strengthened].
{14:6} Now, believers, if I come to you speaking in unknown tongues, how will I benefit you unless I also speak to you [clearly] either by revelation [revealing God's mystery], or by knowledge [teaching about God], or by prophecy [foretelling the future, speaking a new message from God to the people], or by instruction [teaching precepts that develop spiritual maturity]?
{14:7} Yet even lifeless things, whether flute or harp, when producing a sound, if they do not produce distinct [musical] tones, how will anyone [listening] know what is piped or played?
{14:8} And if the [war] bugle produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare himself for battle?
{14:9} So it is with you, if you speak words [in an unknown tongue] that are not intelligible and clear, how will anyone understand what you are saying? You will be talking into the air [wasting your breath]!
{14:10} There are, I suppose, a great many kinds of languages in the world [unknown to us], and none is lacking in meaning.
{14:11} But if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will [appear to] be a foreigner to the one who is speaking [since he knows exactly what he is saying], and the one who is speaking will [appear to] be a foreigner to me.
{14:12} So it is with you, since you are so very eager to have spiritual gifts and manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in ways that will build up the church [spiritually].
{14:13} Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may [be gifted to] translate or explain [what he says].
{14:14} For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unproductive [because it does not understand what my spirit is praying].
{14:15} Then what am I to do? I will pray with the spirit [by the Holy Spirit that is within me] and I will pray with the mind [using words I understand]; I will sing with the spirit [by the Holy Spirit that is within me] and I will sing with the mind [using words I understand].
{14:16} Otherwise if you bless [and give thanks to God] in the spirit only, how will any outsider or someone who is not gifted [in spiritual matters] say the “Amen” [of agreement] to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?
{14:17} You are giving thanks well enough [in a way that God is glorified], but the other person [who does not understand you] is not edified [and spiritually strengthened since he cannot join in your thanksgiving].
{14:18} I thank God that I speak in [unknown] tongues more than all of you;
{14:19} nevertheless, in public worship I would rather say five understandable words in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue [which others cannot understand].
{14:20} Brothers and sisters, do not be children [immature, childlike] in your thinking; be infants in [matters of] evil [completely innocent and inexperienced], but in your minds be mature [adults].
{14:21} It is written in the Law, “BY MEN OF STRANGE TONGUES AND BY THE LIPS OF FOREIGNERS I WILL SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE, AND NOT EVEN THEN WILL THEY LISTEN TO ME,” says the Lord.
{14:22} Therefore, [unknown] tongues are [meant] for a [supernatural] sign, not to believers but to unbelievers [who might be receptive]; while prophecy [foretelling the future, speaking a new message from God to the people] is not for unbelievers but for believers.
{14:23} So then, if the whole church gathers together and all of you speak in [unknown] tongues, and outsiders or those who are not gifted [in spiritual matters] or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?
{14:24} But if all prophesy [foretelling the future, speaking a new message from God to the people], and an unbeliever or outsider comes in, he is convicted [of his sins] by all, and he is called to account by all [because he can understand what is being said];
{14:25} the secrets of his heart are laid bare. And so, falling on his face, he will worship God, declaring that God is really among you.
{14:26} What then is the right course, believers? When you meet together, each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation (disclosure of special knowledge), a tongue, or an interpretation. Let everything be constructive and edifying and done for the good of all the church.
{14:27} If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be limited to two or at the most three, and each one speaking in turn, and one must interpret [what is said].
{14:28} But if there is no one to interpret, the one [who wishes to speak in a tongue] must keep silent in church; let him speak to himself and to God.
{14:29} Let two or three prophets speak [as inspired by the Holy Spirit], while the rest pay attention and weigh carefully what is said.
{14:30} But if an inspired revelation is made to another who is seated, then the first one must be silent.
{14:31} For [in this way] you can all prophesy one by one, so that everyone may be instructed and everyone may be encouraged;
{14:32} for the spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets [the prophecy is under the speaker's control, and he can stop speaking];
{14:33} for God [who is the source of their prophesying] is not a God of confusion and disorder but of peace and order.  As [is the practice] in all the churches of the saints (God's people),
{14:34} the women should be silent in the churches, for they are not authorized to speak, but are to take a subordinate place, as the Law says.
{14:35} If there is anything they want to learn [that is, if they have questions about anything being said or taught], they are to ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a woman to talk in church.
{14:36} Did the word of the Lord originate from you [Corinthians], or has it come to you only [so that you know best what God requires]?
{14:37} If anyone thinks and claims that he is a prophet [a true spokesman for God] or spiritually astute [filled with and energized by the Holy Spirit], let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment.
{14:38} If anyone does not recognize this [that it is a command of the Lord], he is not recognized [by God].
{14:39} Therefore, believers, desire earnestly to prophesy [to foretell the future, to speak a new message from God to the people], and do not forbid speaking in unknown tongues.
{14:40} But all things must be done appropriately and in an orderly manner.
{15:1} Now brothers and sisters, let me remind you [once again] of the good news [of salvation] which I preached to you, which you welcomed and accepted and on which you stand [by faith].
{15:2} By this faith you are saved [reborn from above -- spiritually transformed, renewed, and set apart for His purpose], if you hold firmly to the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain [just superficially and without complete commitment].
{15:3} For I passed on to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to [that which] the Scriptures [foretold],
{15:4} and that He was buried, and that He was [bodily] raised on the third day according to [that which] the Scriptures [foretold],
{15:5} and that He appeared to Cephas (Peter), then to the Twelve.
{15:6} After that He appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, the majority of whom are still alive, but some have fallen asleep [in death].
{15:7} Then He was seen by James, then by all the apostles,
{15:8} and last of all, as to one untimely (prematurely, traumatically) born, He appeared to me also.
{15:9} For I am the least [worthy] of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I [at one time] fiercely oppressed and violently persecuted the church of God.
{15:10} But by the [remarkable] grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not without effect. In fact, I worked harder than all of the apostles, though it was not I, but the grace of God [His unmerited favor and blessing which was] with me.
{15:11} So whether it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed and trusted in and relied on with confidence.
{15:12} Now if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, how is it that some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
{15:13} But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised;
{15:14} and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain [useless, amounting to nothing], and your faith is also vain [imaginary, unfounded, devoid of value and benefit -- not based on truth].
{15:15} We are even discovered to be false witnesses [misrepresenting] God, because we testified concerning Him that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised.
{15:16} For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised, either;
{15:17} and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless and powerless [mere delusion]; you are still in your sins [and under the control and penalty of sin].
{15:18} Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.
{15:19} If we who are [abiding] in Christ have hoped only in this life [and this is all there is], then we are of all people most miserable and to be pitied.
{15:20} But now [as things really are] Christ has in fact been raised from the dead, [and He became] the first fruits [that is, the first to be resurrected with an incorruptible, immortal body, foreshadowing the resurrection] of those who have fallen asleep [in death].
{15:21} For since [it was] by a man that death came [into the world], it is also by a Man that the resurrection of the dead has come.
{15:22} For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
{15:23} But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ's [own will be resurrected with incorruptible, immortal bodies] at His coming.
{15:24} After that comes the end (completion), when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father, after He has made inoperative and abolished every ruler and every authority and power.
{15:25} For Christ must reign [as King] until He has put all His enemies under His feet.
{15:26} The last enemy to be abolished and put to an end is death.
{15:27} For HE (the Father) HAS PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS (Christ's) FEET. But when He says, “All things have been put in subjection [under Christ],” it is clear that He (the Father) who put all things in subjection to Him (Christ) is excepted [since the Father is not in subjection to His own Son].
{15:28} However, when all things are subjected to Him (Christ), then the Son Himself will also be subjected to the One (the Father) who put all things under Him, so that God may be all in all [manifesting His glory without any opposition, the supreme indwelling and controlling factor of life].
{15:29} Otherwise, what will those do who are being baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people even baptized for them?
{15:30} [For that matter] why are we [running such risks and putting ourselves] in danger [nearly] every hour [if there is no resurrection]?
{15:31} I assure you, believers, by the pride which I have in you in [your union with] Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily [I face death and die to self].
{15:32} What good has it done me if, [merely] from a human point of view, I fought with wild animals at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised [at all], LET US EAT AND DRINK [enjoying ourselves now], FOR TOMORROW WE DIE.
{15:33} Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.”
{15:34} Be sober-minded [be sensible, wake up from your spiritual stupor] as you ought, and stop sinning; for some [of you] have no knowledge of God [you are disgracefully ignorant of Him, and ignore His truths]. I say this to your shame.
{15:35} But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body will they come?”
{15:36} You fool! Every time you plant seed you sow something that does not come to life [germinating, springing up and growing] unless it first dies.
{15:37} The seed you sow is not the body (the plant) which it is going to become, but it is a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or some other grain.
{15:38} But God gives it a body just as He planned, and to each kind of seed a body of its own [is given].
{15:39} All flesh is not the same. There is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.
{15:40} There are also heavenly bodies [sun, moon and stars] and earthly bodies [humans, animals, and plants], but the glory and beauty of the heavenly is one kind, and the glory of the earthly is another.
{15:41} There is a glory and beauty of the sun, another glory of the moon, and yet another [distinctive] glory of the stars; and one star differs from another in glory and brilliance.
{15:42} So it is with the resurrection of the dead. The [human] body that is sown is perishable and mortal, it is raised imperishable and immortal.
{15:43} It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in strength;
{15:44} it is sown a natural body [mortal, suited to earth], it is raised a spiritual body [immortal, suited to heaven]. As surely as there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.
{15:45} So it is written [in Scripture], “The first MAN, Adam, BECAME A LIVING SOUL (an individual);” the last Adam (Christ) became a life-giving spirit [restoring the dead to life].
{15:46} However, the spiritual [the immortal life] is not first, but the physical [the mortal life]; then the spiritual.
{15:47} The first man [Adam] is from the earth, earthy [made of dust]; the second Man [Christ, the Lord] is from heaven.
{15:48} As is the earthly man [the man of dust], so are those who are of earth; and as is the heavenly [Man], so are those who are of heaven.
{15:49} Just as we have borne the image of the earthly [the man of dust], we will also bear the image of the heavenly [the Man of heaven].
{15:50} Now I say this, believers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit nor be part of the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable (mortal) inherit the imperishable (immortal).
{15:51} Listen very carefully, I tell you a mystery [a secret truth decreed by God and previously hidden, but now revealed]; we will not all sleep [in death], but we will all be [completely] changed [wondrously transformed],
{15:52} in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at [the sound of] the last trumpet call. For a trumpet will sound, and the dead [who believed in Christ] will be raised imperishable, and we will be [completely] changed [wondrously transformed].
{15:53} For this perishable [part of us] must put on the imperishable [nature], and this mortal [part of us that is capable of dying] must put on immortality [which is freedom from death].
{15:54} And when this perishable puts on the imperishable, and this mortal puts on immortality, then the Scripture will be fulfilled that says, “DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in victory (vanquished forever).
{15:55} “O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?”
{15:56} The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin [by which it brings death] is the law;
{15:57} but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory [as conquerors] through our Lord Jesus Christ.
{15:58} Therefore, my beloved brothers and sisters, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord [always doing your best and doing more than is needed], being continually aware that your labor [even to the point of exhaustion] in the Lord is not futile nor wasted [it is never without purpose].
{16:1} Now concerning the money collected for [the relief of] the saints [in Jerusalem], you are to do the same as I directed the churches of Galatia to do.
{16:2} On the first day of every week each one of you is to put something aside, in proportion to his prosperity, and save it so that no collections [will need to] be made when I come.
{16:3} When I arrive, I will send whomever you approve with letters [of authorization] to take your gift [of charity and love] to Jerusalem;
{16:4} and if it is fitting for me to go too, they will accompany me.
{16:5} I will visit you after I go through Macedonia, for I am only passing through Macedonia;
{16:6} but it may be that I will stay with you [for a while], or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way to wherever I may go afterward.
{16:7} For I do not wish to see you right now just in passing, but I hope to remain with you for some time [later on], if the Lord permits.
{16:8} But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,
{16:9} because a wide door for effective service has opened to me [in Ephesus, a very promising opportunity], and there are many adversaries.
{16:10} If Timothy comes, see to it that [you put him at ease, so that] he has nothing to fear in regard to you, for he is [devotedly] doing the Lord's work, just as I am.
{16:11} So allow no one to treat him with disdain [as if he were inconsequential]. But send him off [cordially, and speed him on his way] in peace, so that he may come to me, for I am expecting him [to come along] with the other brothers.
{16:12} As for our brother Apollos, I have strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers. It was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has the opportunity.
{16:13} Be on guard; stand firm in your faith [in God, respecting His precepts and keeping your doctrine sound]. Act like [mature] men and be courageous; be strong.
{16:14} Let everything you do be done in love [motivated and inspired by God's love for us].
{16:15} Brothers and sisters, you know that those of the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves for ministry to God's people -- now I urge you
{16:16} to be subject to such leaders [treating them with courtesy and respect], and to everyone who helps in the work and labors [for the benefit of yourselves and the church].
{16:17} I rejoice because Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have arrived, for they have made up for your absence.
{16:18} They have refreshed my spirit as well as yours. So fully acknowledge such men and deeply appreciate them.
{16:19} The churches of Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church [that meets] in their house, send you their warm greetings in the Lord.
{16:20} All the believers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
{16:21} This greeting is in my own hand -- Paul.
{16:22} If anyone does not love the Lord [does not obey and respect and believe in Jesus Christ and His message], he is to be accursed. Maranatha (O our Lord, come)!
{16:23} The grace of our Lord Jesus [His unmerited favor, His spiritual blessing, His profound mercy] be with you.
{16:24} My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
