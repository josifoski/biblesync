{2:15} “Catch the foxes for us, The little foxes that spoil and ruin the vineyards [of love], While our vineyards are in blossom.”
{2:16} “My beloved is mine and I am his; He pastures his flock among the lilies.
{2:17} “Until the cool of the day when the shadows flee away, Return quickly, my beloved, and be like a gazelle Or a young stag on the mountains of Bether [which separate us].”

{4:11} “Your lips, my [promised] bride, drip honey [as the honeycomb]; Honey and milk are under your tongue, And the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
{4:12} “A garden enclosed is my sister, my [promised] bride -- A rock garden locked, a spring sealed up.
{4:13} “Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, [A paradise] with precious fruits, henna with fragrant plants,
