{1:1} The vision of Oḇaḏyah: This is what the Master יהוה said concerning Eḏom. We have heard a report from יהוה, and a messenger has been sent among the nations, saying, “Arise, and let us rise up against her for battle!”
{1:2} “See, I have made you small among the nations, you are greatly despised.
{1:3} “The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose dwelling is high, who say in your heart, ‘Who shall bring me down to the ground?’
{1:4} “Though you rise high as the eagle, and though you set your nest among the stars, from there I shall bring you down,” declares יהוה.
{1:5} “If thieves came to you, if robbers by night, how ruined you would have been! Would they not steal till they had enough? If grape-gatherers had come to you, would they not leave gleanings?
{1:6} “How Ěsaw shall be searched out! His hidden treasures shall be sought out!
{1:7} “All your allies shall send you forth to the border, your friends shall deceive you and overpower you. They make your bread a snare under you, without you discerning it!
{1:8} “In that day,” declares יהוה, “I shall destroy the wise men from Eḏom, and discernment from the mountains of Ěsaw!
{1:9} “And your mighty men shall be discouraged, O Tĕman, so that everyone from the mountains of Ěsaw is cut off by killing.
{1:10} “Because of your violence against your brother Ya‛aqoḇ, let shame cover you. And you shall be cut off forever.
{1:11} “In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that strangers took captive his wealth, when foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Yerushalayim, you also were like one of them!
{1:12} “And you should not have looked on your brother’s day in the day of his estrangement, nor rejoiced over the children of Yehuḏah in the day of their destruction, nor made your mouth great in the day of distress,
{1:13} nor have entered the gate of My people in the day of their calamity, nor looked down on their evil in the day of their calamity, nor have seized their wealth in the day of their calamity,
{1:14} nor have stood at the parting of the way to cut off his fugitives, nor handed over his survivors in the day of distress.
{1:15} “For the day of יהוה is near upon all the nations. As you have done, it shall be done to you, your reward shall come back on your own head.
{1:16} “For as you have drunk on my set-apart mountain, so do all the nations drink continually. And they shall drink and shall swallow, and they shall be as though they had never been.
{1:17} “But on Mount Tsiyon there shall be an escape, and they shall be set-apart. And the house of Ya‛aqoḇ shall possess their possessions.
{1:18} “And the house of Ya‛aqoḇ shall be a fire, and the house of Yosĕph a flame, but the house of Ěsaw for stubble. And they shall burn among them and they shall consume them, so that no survivor is left of the house of Ěsaw.” For יהוה has spoken.
{1:19} And they shall possess the South with the mountains of Ěsaw, and low country with the Philistines. And they shall possess the fields of Ephrayim and the fields of Shomeron, and Binyamin with Gil‛aḏ,
{1:20} and the exiles of this host of the children of Yisra’ĕl possess that of the Kena‛anites as far as Tsarephath, and the exiles of Yerushalayim who are in Sepharaḏ possess the cities of the South.
{1:21} And saviours shall come to Mount Tsiyon to judge the mountains of Ěsaw. And the reign shall belong to יהוה.
