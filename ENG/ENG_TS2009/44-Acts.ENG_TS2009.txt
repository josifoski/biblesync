{1:1} The first account I made, O Theophilos, of all that יהושע began both to do and to teach,
{1:2} until the day when He was taken up, after giving instructions through the Set-apart Spirit to the emissaries whom He had chosen,
{1:3} to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them for forty days, speaking concerning the reign of Elohim.
{1:4} And meeting with them, He commanded them not to leave Yerushalayim, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, “which you have heard from Me –
{1:5} because Yoḥanan truly immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Set-apart Spirit not many days from now.”
{1:6} So when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, “Master, would You at this time restore the reign to Yisra’ĕl?”
{1:7} And He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority.
{1:8} But you shall receive power when the Set-apart Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses in Yerushalayim, and in all Yehuḏah and Shomeron, and to the end of the earth.
{1:9} And having said this, while they were looking on, He was taken up, and a cloud hid Him from their sight.
{1:10} And as they were gazing into the heaven as He went up, see, two men stood by them dressed in white,
{1:11} who also said, “Men of Galil, why do you stand looking up into the heaven? This same יהושע, who was taken up from you into the heaven, shall come in the same way as you saw Him go into the heaven.”
{1:12} Then they went back to Yerushalayim from the Mount of Olives, which is near Yerushalayim, a Sabbath day’s journey.
{1:13} And when they came in, they went up into the upper room where they were staying: both Kĕpha and Ya‛aqoḇ and Yoḥanan and Andri, Philip and T’oma, Bartholomi and Mattithyahu, Ya‛aqoḇ the son of Alphai and Shim‛on the Zealot, and Yehuḏah the son of Ya‛aqoḇ.
{1:14} All these were continuing with one mind in prayer and supplication, with the women and Miryam the mother of יהושע, and with His brothers.
{1:15} And in those days Kĕpha, standing up in the midst of the taught ones – and there was a gathering of about a hundred and twenty – said,
{1:16} “Men and brothers, this Scripture had to be filled which the Set-apart Spirit spoke before by the mouth of Dawiḏ concerning Yehuḏah, who became a guide to those who seized יהושע,
{1:17} “because he was numbered with us and did receive his share in this service.
{1:18} (This one, therefore, purchased a field with the wages of unrighteousness, and falling forward, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out.
{1:19} And it became known to all those dwelling in Yerushalayim, so that in their own language that field was called, Ḥaqal Dema, that is, Field of Blood).
{1:20} “For it has been written in the Book of Tehillim, ‘Let his dwelling lie waste, and let no one live in it,’ and, ‘Let another take his office.’
{1:21} It is therefore necessary that of the men who have been with us all the time that the Master יהושע went in and out among us,”
{1:22} beginning from the immersion of Yoḥanan to that day when He was taken up from us, that one of these should become a witness with us of His resurrection.”
{1:23} And they put forward two: Yosĕph called Barsabba, who was also called Justus, and Mattithyahu.
{1:24} And praying they said, “You, יהוה, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two You have chosen
{1:25} to receive the share in this service and office of the emissary from which Yehuḏah by transgression fell, to go to his own place.”
{1:26} And they cast their lots, and the lot fell on Mattithyahu. And he was numbered with the eleven emissaries.
{2:1} And when the Day of the Festival of Shaḇu‛ot had come, they were all with one mind in one place.
{2:2} And suddenly there came a sound from the heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
{2:3} And there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and settled on each one of them.
{2:4} And they were all filled with the Set-apart Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them to speak.
{2:5} Now in Yerushalayim there were dwelling Yehuḏim, dedicated men from every nation under the heaven.
{2:6} And when this sound came to be, the crowd came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language.
{2:7} And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying to each other, “Look, are not all these who speak Galileans?
{2:8} “And how do we hear, each one in our own language in which we were born?
{2:9} Parthians and Medes and Ěylamites, and those dwelling in Aram Naharayim, both Yehuḏah and Kappadokia, Pontos and Asia,”
{2:10} both Phrygia and Pamphulia, Mitsrayim and the parts of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Yehuḏim and converts,
{2:11} Cretans and Araḇs, we hear them speaking in our own tongues the great deeds of Elohim.
{2:12} And they were all amazed, and were puzzled, saying to each other, “What does this mean?”
{2:13} And others mocking said, “They have been filled with sweet wine.”
{2:14} But Kĕpha, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and said to them, “Men of Yehuḏah and all those dwelling in Yerushalayim, let this be known to you, and listen closely to my words.
{2:15} “For these men are not drunk, as you imagine, since it is only the third hour of the day.
{2:16} But this is what was spoken by the prophet Yo’ĕl:
{2:17} ‘And it shall be in the last days, says Elohim, that I shall pour out of My Spirit on all flesh. And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams,
{2:18} and also on My male servants and on My female servants I shall pour out My Spirit in those days, and they shall prophesy.
{2:19} ‘And I shall show wonders in the heaven above and signs in the earth beneath: blood and fire and vapour of smoke.
{2:20} ‘The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and splendid day of יהוה.
{2:21} ‘And it shall be that everyone who calls on the Name of יהוה shall be saved.’
{2:22} “Men of Yisra’ĕl, hear these words: יהושע of Natsareth, a Man from Elohim, having been pointed out to you by mighty works, and wonders, and signs which Elohim did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know,
{2:23} this One, given up by the set purpose and foreknowledge of Elohim, you have impaled and put to death through the hands of lawless men –
{2:24} “Him Elohim raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, because it was impossible that He could be held in its grip.
{2:25} “For Dawiḏ says concerning Him, ‘I saw יהוה before me continually, because He is at my right hand, in order that I should not be shaken.
{2:26} ‘For this reason my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad, and now my flesh shall also rest in expectation,
{2:27} because You shall not leave my being in She’ol, nor shall You give Your Lovingly-committed One to see corruption.
{2:28} ‘You have made known to me the ways of life, You shall fill me with joy in Your presence.’
{2:29} Men and brothers, let me speak boldly to you of the ancestor Dawiḏ, that he died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
{2:30} “Being a prophet, then, and knowing that Elohim had sworn with an oath to him: of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, to raise up the Messiah to sit on his throne,
{2:31} foreseeing this he spoke concerning the resurrection of the Messiah, that His being was neither left in She’ol, nor did His flesh see corruption.
{2:32} “Elohim has raised up this יהושע, of which we are all witnesses.
{2:33} “Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of Elohim, and having received from the Father the promise of the Set-apart Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear.
{2:34} “For Dawiḏ did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself said, ‘יהוה said to my Master, “Sit at My right hand,
{2:35} until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”’
{2:36} Therefore let all the house of Yisra’ĕl know for certain that Elohim has made this יהושע, whom you impaled, both Master and Messiah.
{2:37} And having heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Kĕpha and the rest of the emissaries, “Men, brothers, what shall we do?”
{2:38} And Kĕpha said to them, “Repent, and let each one of you be immersed in the Name of יהושע Messiah for the forgiveness of sins. And you shall receive the gift of the Set-apart Spirit.
{2:39} For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are far off, as many as יהוה our Elohim shall call.
{2:40} And with many other words he earnestly witnessed and urged them, saying, “Be saved from this crooked generation.”
{2:41} Then those, indeed, who gladly received his word, were immersed. And on that day about three thousand beings were added to them.
{2:42} And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching of the emissaries, and in the fellowship, and in the breaking of bread, and in the prayers.
{2:43} And fear came upon every being, and many wonders and signs were being done through the emissaries.
{2:44} And all those who believed were together, and had all in common,
{2:45} and sold their possessions and property, and divided them among all, as anyone might have need.
{2:46} And day by day, continuing with one mind in the Set-apart Place, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,
{2:47} praising Elohim and having favour with all the people. And the Master added to the assembly those who were being saved, day by day.
{3:1} And Kĕpha and Yoḥanan were going up to the Set-apart Place at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.
{3:2} And a certain man, lame from his birth, was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the Set-apart Place which is called Yaphah, to ask alms from those entering into the Set-apart Place,
{3:3} who, seeing Kĕpha and Yoḥanan about to go into the Set-apart Place, asked for alms.
{3:4} And Kĕpha, with Yoḥanan, looking steadfastly at him, said, “Look at us.”
{3:5} And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive whatever from them.
{3:6} But Kĕpha said, “I do not have silver and gold, but what I do possess, this I give you: In the Name of יהושע Messiah of Natsareth, rise up and walk.”
{3:7} And taking him by the right hand he lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones were made firm.
{3:8} And leaping up, he stood and walked, and went in with them into the Set-apart Place, walking and leaping and praising Elohim.
{3:9} And all the people saw him walking and praising Elohim.
{3:10} And they recognised him, that it was he who sat begging alms at the Lovely Gate of the Set-apart Place. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what befell him.
{3:11} And as the lame man who was healed was clinging to Kĕpha and Yoḥanan, all the people ran together to them in the porch which is called Shelomoh’s, greatly amazed.
{3:12} And seeing it, Kĕpha responded to the people, “Men of Yisra’ĕl, why do you marvel at this? Or why look so intently at us, as though by our own power or reverence we have made him walk?
{3:13} “The Elohim of Aḇraham, and of Yitsḥaq, and of Ya‛aqoḇ, the Elohim of our fathers, esteemed His Servant יהושע, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him.
{3:14} “But you denied the Set-apart and Righteous One, and asked that a man, a murderer, be granted you.
{3:15} “But you killed the Prince of life, whom Elohim raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
{3:16} “And by the belief in His Name, this one whom you see and know, His Name made strong, and the belief which comes through Him has given him this perfect healing before all of you.
{3:17} “And now, brothers, I know that you did it in ignorance, as your rulers did too.
{3:18} “But this is how Elohim has filled what He had announced beforehand through the mouth of all the prophets, that His Messiah was to suffer.
{3:19} “Repent therefore and turn back, for the blotting out of your sins, in order that times of refreshing might come from the presence of the Master,
{3:20} and that He sends יהושע Messiah, pre-appointed for you,
{3:21} whom heaven needs to receive until the times of restoration of all matters, of which Elohim spoke through the mouth of all His set-apart prophets since of old.
{3:22} “For Mosheh truly said to the fathers, ‘יהוה your Elohim shall raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brothers. Him you shall hear according to all matters, whatever He says to you.
{3:23} ‘And it shall be that every being who does not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.’
{3:24} “And likewise, all the prophets who have spoken, from Shemu’ĕl and those following, have also announced these days.
{3:25} “You are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which Elohim made with our fathers, saying to Aḇraham, ‘And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.’
{3:26} “To you first, Elohim, having raised up His Servant יהושע, sent Him to bless you, in turning away each one of you from your wicked ways.”
{4:1} And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the Set-apart Place, and the Sadducees, came upon them,
{4:2} being annoyed because they taught the people and announced the resurrection from the dead in יהושע.
{4:3} And they arrested them, and put them in jail until the next day, for it was already evening.
{4:4} But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men became about five thousand.
{4:5} And it came to be, on the next day, that their rulers and elders and scribes assembled in Yerushalayim,
{4:6} as well as Ḥanan the high priest, and Qayapha, and Yoḥanan, and Alexander, and as many as were of high priestly descent.
{4:7} And having placed them in the middle, they asked, “By what power or in what Name did you do this?”
{4:8} Then Kĕpha, filled with the Set-apart Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders of Yisra’ĕl:
{4:9} “If today we are called to account for a good deed towards a sick man, by whom he has been healed,
{4:10} let it be known to all of you, and to all the people of Yisra’ĕl, that in the Name of יהושע Messiah of Natsareth, whom you impaled, whom Elohim raised from the dead, by Him this one stands before you, healthy.
{4:11} This is ‘the stone which was rejected by you builders, which has become the chief corner-stone.’
{4:12} And there is no deliverance in anyone else, for there is no other Name under the heaven given among men by which we need to be saved.
{4:13} And seeing the boldness of Kĕpha and Yoḥanan, and perceiving that they were unlearned and ordinary men, they marvelled. And they recognised that they had been with יהושע.
{4:14} And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they could not contradict it.
{4:15} But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they consulted with one another,
{4:16} saying, “What shall we do to these men? For, indeed, that an outstanding miracle has been done through them is apparent to all those dwelling in Yerushalayim, and we are unable to deny it.
{4:17} But in order that it spreads no further among the people, let us strongly threaten them, to speak no more to anyone in this Name.
{4:18} And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor to teach in the Name of יהושע.
{4:19} But Kĕpha and Yoḥanan answering them, said, “Whether it is right in the sight of Elohim to listen to you more than to Elohim, you judge.
{4:20} For it is impossible for us not to speak of what we saw and heard.
{4:21} And having threatened them further, they released them, finding no way of punishing them, because of the people, because they were all praising Elohim for what had been done.
{4:22} For the man was over forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been done.
{4:23} And having been released, they went to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and elders said to them.
{4:24} And having heard that, they lifted up their voice to Elohim with one mind and said, “יהוה, You are Elohim, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them,
{4:25} who by the mouth of Your servant Dawiḏ have said, ‘Why did the nations rage, and the people plot in vain?
{4:26} ‘The sovereigns of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against יהוה and against His Messiah.’
{4:27} “For truly, in this city there were gathered together against Your set-apart Servant יהושע, whom You anointed, both Herodes and Pontius Pilate, with the nations and the people of Yisra’ĕl
{4:28} to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose decided before to be done.
{4:29} “And now, יהוה, look on their threats, and give to Your servants all boldness to speak Your word,
{4:30} by stretching out Your hand for healing, and signs, and wonders to take place through the Name of Your set-apart Servant יהושע.”
{4:31} And when they had prayed, the place where they came together was shaken. And they were all filled with the Set-apart Spirit, and they spoke the word of Elohim with boldness.
{4:32} And the group of those who believed were of one heart and one being. And no one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they had all in common.
{4:33} And with great power the emissaries gave witness to the resurrection of the Master יהושע, and great favour was upon them all.
{4:34} For there was not anyone needy among them, for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of what was sold,
{4:35} and laid them at the feet of the emissaries, and they distributed to each as anyone had need.
{4:36} And Yosĕph, who was also called Barnaḇa by the emissaries (which means Son of Encouragement), a Lĕwite, a native of Cyprus,
{4:37} having land, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the feet of the emissaries.
{5:1} But a certain man named Ḥananyah, with Shappirah his wife, sold a possession.
{5:2} And he kept back from the price, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part and laid it at the feet of the emissaries.
{5:3} But Kĕpha said, “Ḥananyah, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Set-apart Spirit and keep back from the price of the land for yourself?
{5:4} While it remained, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your authority? Why have you conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to Elohim.
{5:5} Then Ḥananyah, hearing these words, fell down and breathed his last. And great fear came upon all those who heard of this.
{5:6} But the young men arose and wrapped him up, carried him out and buried him.
{5:7} And it came to be, about three hours later, that his wife came in, not knowing what had taken place.
{5:8} And Kĕpha responded to her, “Say to me whether you sold the land for so much?” And she said, “Yes, for so much.”
{5:9} So Kĕpha said to her, “Why have you agreed to try the Spirit of יהוה? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you out.”
{5:10} And immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. And the young men came in and found her dead, and carrying her out, they buried her beside her husband.
{5:11} And great fear came upon all the assembly and upon all who heard of this.
{5:12} And through the hands of the emissaries many signs and wonders were done among the people. And they were all with one mind in Shelomoh’s Porch.
{5:13} But of the rest no one had the courage to join them, however, the people made much of them.
{5:14} And more believers were added to the Master, large numbers of both men and women,
{5:15} so that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Kĕpha, passing by, might fall on some of them.
{5:16} A large number also gathered from the surrounding cities to Yerushalayim, bringing sick ones and those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.
{5:17} But the high priest rose up, and all those with him, which is the sect of the Sadducees, and they were filled with jealousy,
{5:18} and seized the emissaries and put them in the public jail.
{5:19} But a messenger of יהוה opened the prison doors at night and brought them out, and said,
{5:20} Go and stand in the Set-apart Place and speak to the people all the words of this life.
{5:21} Now when they heard, they went into the Set-apart Place early in the morning, and were teaching. But the high priest and those with him came and called the council together, with all the elders of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and sent to the prison for them to be brought.
{5:22} But having come, the officers did not find them in the prison, and they went back and reported it,
{5:23} saying, “We found the prison shut in all safety, and the watches standing outside before the doors. But having opened them, we found no one inside!”
{5:24} And as the high priest and the captain of the Set-apart Place and the chief priests heard these words, they were puzzled and wondered what this might be.
{5:25} But one came and reported to them, saying, “Look, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the Set-apart Place and teaching the people!”
{5:26} Then the captain went with the officers and brought them, not with force, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.
{5:27} And having brought them, they set them before the council and the high priest asked them,
{5:28} saying, “Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this Name? And look, you have filled Yerushalayim with your teaching, and intend to bring the blood of this Man upon us!”
{5:29} And Kĕpha and the other emissaries answering, said, “We have to obey Elohim rather than men.
{5:30} “The Elohim of our fathers raised up יהושע whom you laid hands on, hanging Him on a timber.
{5:31} Him, a Prince and a Saviour, Elohim has exalted to His right hand, to give repentance to Yisra’ĕl and forgiveness of sins.
{5:32} And we are His witnesses to these matters, and so also is the Set-apart Spirit whom Elohim has given to those who obey Him.”
{5:33} And those hearing were cut to the heart, and took counsel to kill them.
{5:34} But a certain one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamli’ĕl, a teacher of the Torah, respected by all the people, and ordered them to put the emissaries outside for a little while,
{5:35} and said to them, “Men of Yisra’ĕl, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do to these men.
{5:36} “For before these days Toḏah rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, did join him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were dispersed, and came to naught.
{5:37} “After him, Yehuḏah of Galil rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were scattered.
{5:38} “And now I say to you, stay away from these men and leave them alone, because if this plan or this work is of men, it shall be overthrown,
{5:39} “but if it is of Elohim, you are unable to overthrow it, lest you even be found to fight against Elohim.
{5:40} And they heeded his advice, and having called for the emissaries, beating them, they commanded that they should not speak in the Name of יהושע, and let them go.
{5:41} Then indeed they went rejoicing from the presence of the council, because they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His Name.
{5:42} And daily in the Set-apart Place, and in every house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the Good News: יהושע the Messiah!
{6:1} And in those days, when the taught ones were increasing, there arose a grumbling against the Hebrews by the Hellenists, because their widows were overlooked in the daily serving.
{6:2} So the twelve summoned the group of the taught ones and said, “It is not pleasing for us to leave the Word of Elohim and serve tables.
{6:3} “Therefore, brothers, seek out from among you seven men who are known to be filled with the Set-apart Spirit and wisdom, whom we shall appoint for this duty,
{6:4} “but we shall give ourselves continually to prayer and to serving the Word.
{6:5} And the word pleased the entire group. And they chose Stephanos, a man filled with belief and the Set-apart Spirit, and Philip, and Prochoros, and Nikanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nikolaos, a convert from Antioch,
{6:6} whom they set before the emissaries. And when they had prayed, they laid hands on them.
{6:7} And the Word of Elohim spread, and the number of the taught ones increased greatly in Yerushalayim, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the belief.
{6:8} And Stephanos, filled with belief and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.
{6:9} But some of those of the so-called Congregation of the Freedmen (Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Kilikia and Asia), rose up, disputing with Stephanos,
{6:10} but they were unable to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.
{6:11} Then they instigated men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Mosheh and Elohim.”
{6:12} And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, so they came upon him, seized him, and brought him to the council.
{6:13} And they set up false witnesses who said, “This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this set-apart place and the Torah,
{6:14} for we have heard him saying that this יהושע of Natsareth shall overthrow this place and change the institutes which Mosheh delivered unto us.”
{6:15} And all who sat in the council, looking steadily at him, saw his face was like the face of a heavenly messenger.
{7:1} And the high priest said, “Is this so?”
{7:2} And he replied, “Men, brothers and fathers, listen: The Elohim of esteem appeared to our father Aḇraham when he was in Aram Naharayim, before he dwelt in Ḥaran,
{7:3} and said to him, ‘Come out of your land and from your relatives, and come here, into a land that I shall show you.’
{7:4} “Then he came out of the land of the Kasdim and dwelt in Ḥaran. And from there, after the death of his father, He removed him to this land in which you now dwell.
{7:5} “And He gave him no inheritance in it, not a foot of it. But He promised to give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.
{7:6} “And Elohim spoke in this way: that his seed would be sojourning in a foreign land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.
{7:7} ‘And the nation to whom they shall be enslaved, I shall judge,’ said Elohim, ‘and after that they shall come out and serve Me in this place.’
{7:8} “And He gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so he brought forth Yitsḥaq and circumcised him on the eighth day. And Yitsḥaq brought forth Ya‛aqoḇ, and Ya‛aqoḇ brought forth the twelve ancestors.
{7:9} “And the ancestors, becoming jealous, sold Yosĕph into Mitsrayim. But Elohim was with him,
{7:10} and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom before Pharaoh, sovereign of Mitsrayim. And he appointed him governor over Mitsrayim and all his house.
{7:11} “Then a scarcity of food and great distress came over all the land of Mitsrayim and Kena’an, and our fathers found no food.
{7:12} “But Ya‛aqoḇ heard that there was grain in Mitsrayim, and he sent out our fathers the first time,
{7:13} and at the second time Yosĕph was made known to his brothers, and Yosĕph’s race became known to the Pharaoh.
{7:14} “And Yosĕph sent and called his father Ya‛aqoḇ and all his relatives to him, seventy-five people.
{7:15} “And Ya‛aqoḇ went down to Mitsrayim, and died, he and our fathers,
{7:16} and they were brought over to Sheḵem and laid in the tomb that Aḇraham bought for a price of silver from the sons of Ḥamor, the father of Sheḵem.
{7:17} “But as the time of the promise drew near which Elohim had sworn to Aḇraham, the people increased and multiplied in Mitsrayim
{7:18} until another sovereign arose who did not know Yosĕph.
{7:19} “Having dealt treacherously with our race, this one mistreated our fathers, making them expose their babies, so that they should not live.
{7:20} “At that time Mosheh was born, and he was well-pleasing to Elohim. And he was reared three months in the house of his father.
{7:21} “But when he was exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh took him up and reared him as her own son.
{7:22} “And Mosheh was instructed in all the wisdom of the Mitsrites, and was mighty in words and works.
{7:23} “And when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Yisra’ĕl.
{7:24} “And seeing one of them being wronged, he defended and revenged him who was oppressed, smiting the Mitsrian.
{7:25} “And he thought that his brothers would have understood that Elohim would give deliverance to them by his hand, but they did not understand.
{7:26} “And the next day he appeared to two of them as they were fighting, and urged them to peace, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers, why do you wrong one another?’
{7:27} “But he who was wronging his neighbour pushed him away, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
{7:28} ‘Do you wish to kill me as you killed the Mitsrian yesterday?’
{7:29} “And at this saying, Mosheh fled and became a sojourner in the land of Miḏyan, where he fathered two sons.
{7:30} “And after forty years were completed, a Messenger of יהוה appeared to him in a flame of fire in a bush, in the wilderness of Mount Sinai.
{7:31} “And Mosheh, seeing it, marvelled at the sight, and coming near to look, the voice of יהוה came to him,
{7:32} saying, ‘I am the Elohim of your fathers, the Elohim of Aḇraham and the Elohim of Yitsḥaq and the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.’ And Mosheh trembled and did not have the courage to look.
{7:33} ‘But יהוה said to him, Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is set-apart ground.
{7:34} “I have certainly seen the evil treatment of my people who are in Mitsrayim, and I have heard their groaning and have come down to deliver them. And now come, let Me send you to Mitsrayim.”’
{7:35} “This Mosheh whom they had refused, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’ – this one Elohim sent to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the Messenger who appeared to him in the bush.
{7:36} “This one led them out, after he had done wonders and signs in the land of Mitsrayim, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
{7:37} “This is the Mosheh who said to the children of Yisra’ĕl, ‘יהוה your Elohim shall raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brothers. Him you shall hear.’
{7:38} “This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the Messenger who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, who received the living Words to give to us,
{7:39} unto whom our fathers would not become obedient, but thrust away, and in their hearts they turned back to Mitsrayim,
{7:40} saying to Aharon, ‘Make us mighty ones to go before us, for this Mosheh who led us out of the land of Mitsrayim, we do not know what has become of him.’
{7:41} “And they made a calf in those days, and brought an offering to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their own hands.
{7:42} “So Elohim turned and gave them up to worship the host of the heaven, as it has been written in the book of the Prophets, ‘Did you bring slaughtered beasts and offerings unto Me during forty years in the wilderness, O house of Yisra’ĕl?
{7:43} ‘And you took up the tent of Moleḵ, and the star of your mighty one Kiyyun, images which you made to bow before them. Therefore I shall remove you beyond Baḇel.’
{7:44} “The Tent of Witness was with our fathers in the wilderness, as He appointed, instructing Mosheh to make it according to the pattern that he had seen,
{7:45} which our fathers, having received it in turn, also brought with Yehoshua into the land possessed by the nations, whom Elohim drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of Dawiḏ,
{7:46} who found favour before Elohim and asked to find a dwelling for the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ,
{7:47} but Shelomoh built Him a house.
{7:48} “However, the Most High does not dwell in dwellings made with hands, as the prophet says:
{7:49} ‘The heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool. What house shall you build for Me? says יהוה, or what is the place of My rest?
{7:50} ‘Has My hand not made all these?’
{7:51} “You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Set-apart Spirit, as your fathers did, you also do.
{7:52} “Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who before announced the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you now have become the betrayers and murderers,
{7:53} who received the Torah as it was ordained by messengers, but did not watch over it.”
{7:54} And hearing this they were cut to the hearts and gnashed the teeth at him.
{7:55} But he, being filled with the Set-apart Spirit, looked steadily into the heaven and saw the esteem of Elohim, and יהושע standing at the right hand of Elohim,
{7:56} and he said, “Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Aḏam standing at the right hand of Elohim!”
{7:57} And crying out with a loud voice, they stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one mind,
{7:58} and threw him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Sha’ul.
{7:59} And they were stoning Stephanos as he was calling and saying, “Master יהושע, receive my spirit.”
{7:60} And kneeling down he cried out with a loud voice, “Master, do not hold this sin against them.” And having said this, he fell asleep.
{8:1} And Sha’ul was giving approval to his death. And on that day there was a great persecution against the assembly which was at Yerushalayim, and they were all scattered throughout the countries of Yehuḏah and Shomeron, except the emissaries.
{8:2} And dedicated men buried Stephanos, and made great lamentation over him.
{8:3} But Sha’ul was ravaging the assembly, entering every house, and dragging off men and women, putting them in prison.
{8:4} Then those who had been scattered went everywhere bringing the Good News: the Word!
{8:5} And going down to the city of Shomeron Philip proclaimed Messiah to them.
{8:6} And the crowds with one mind heeded what Philip said, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
{8:7} For unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, crying with a loud voice, and many who were paralysed and lame were healed.
{8:8} And there came to be great joy in that city.
{8:9} Now there was a certain man called Shim‛on, who formerly was practising magic in the city and astonishing the people of Shomeron, claiming to be someone great,
{8:10} to whom they all were giving heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This one is the power of Elohim, which is great.”
{8:11} And they were giving heed to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.
{8:12} And when they believed Philip as he brought the Good News about the reign of Elohim and the Name of יהושע Messiah, both men and women were immersed.
{8:13} And Shim‛on himself also believed. And when he was immersed he continued with Philip, and was amazed, seeing the miracles and signs which took place.
{8:14} And when the emissaries who were at Yerushalayim heard that Shomeron had received the Word of Elohim, they sent Kĕpha and Yoḥanan to them,
{8:15} who, when they had come down, prayed for them to receive the Set-apart Spirit,
{8:16} for He had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been immersed in the Name of the Master יהושע.
{8:17} Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Set-apart Spirit.
{8:18} And Shim‛on, seeing that through the laying on of the hands of the emissaries the Set-apart Spirit was given, he offered them money,
{8:19} saying, “Give me this authority too, so that anyone I lay hands on shall receive the Set-apart Spirit.”
{8:20} But Kĕpha said to him, “Let your silver perish with you, because you thought to buy the gift of Elohim through money!
{8:21} “You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before Elohim.
{8:22} “Repent therefore of this evil of yours, and plead with Elohim to forgive you the intention of your heart.
{8:23} “For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and bound by unrighteousness.
{8:24} But Shim‛on answering, said, “Plead with the Master for me, so that none of what you had said shall come upon me.”
{8:25} Then after they had earnestly witnessed and spoken the Word of יהוה, they returned to Yerushalayim, bringing the Good News in many villages of the Shomeronim.
{8:26} But a messenger of יהוה spoke to Philip, saying, “Arise and go toward the south along the way which goes down from Yerushalayim to Azzah.” This is desert.
{8:27} And he arose and went, and saw, a man of Kush, a eunuch of great authority under Kandake the sovereigness of the Kushites, who was in charge of all her treasury, and had come to Yerushalayim to worship,
{8:28} and was returning. And sitting in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Yeshayahu.
{8:29} And the Spirit said to Philip, “Go near and join him in that chariot.”
{8:30} And running up, Philip heard him reading the prophet Yeshayahu, and said, “Do you know what you are reading?”
{8:31} And he said, “How am I able, unless someone guides me?” And he called Philip near, to come up and sit with him.
{8:32} And the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this, “He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and like a lamb silent before its shearer, so He opened not His mouth.
{8:33} “In His humiliation He was deprived of right-ruling. And who shall declare His generation? Because His life was taken from the earth.”
{8:34} And the eunuch, answering Philip, said, “I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this, about himself or about some other?”
{8:35} And Philip opening his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, brought to him the Good News: יהושע!
{8:36} And as they were going on the way, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “Look, water! What hinders me from being immersed?”
{8:37} And Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, it is permitted.” And he answering, said, “I believe the Son of Elohim to be יהושע the Messiah.”
{8:38} And he commanded the chariot to stand still. And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he immersed him.
{8:39} And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of יהוה caught Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went his way, rejoicing.
{8:40} Philip, however, was found at Ashdoḏ. And passing through, he brought the Good News in all the cities until he came to Caesarea.
{9:1} But Sha’ul, still breathing threats and murder against the taught ones of the Master, having come to the high priest,
{9:2} asked from him letters to the congregations of Dammeseq, so that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, to bring them bound to Yerushalayim.
{9:3} And it came to be, that as he journeyed, he came near Dammeseq, and suddenly a light flashed around him from the heaven.
{9:4} And he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, “Sha’ul, Sha’ul, why do you persecute Me?”
{9:5} And he said, “Who are You, Master?” And the Master said, “I am יהושע, whom you persecute. It is hard for you to kick against the prods.”
{9:6} Both trembling, and being astonished, he said, “Master, what do You wish me to do?” And the Master said to him, “Arise and go into the city, and you shall be told what you have to do.”
{9:7} And the men journeying with him stood speechless, hearing indeed the voice but seeing no one.
{9:8} And Sha’ul arose from the ground, but when his eyes were opened he saw no one. And leading him by the hand they brought him into Dammeseq.
{9:9} And he was three days without sight, and did not eat nor drink.
{9:10} And there was at Dammeseq a certain taught one, by name Ḥananyah. And the Master said unto him in a vision, “Ḥananyah!” And he said, “Here I am, Master.”
{9:11} And the Master said to him, “Arise and go to the street called Straight, and seek in the house of Yehuḏah for one called Sha’ul of Tarsos, for look, he is praying,
{9:12} and has seen in a vision a man named Ḥananyah coming in and laying his hand on him, so as to see again.”
{9:13} And Ḥananyah answered, “Master, I have heard from many about this man, how many evils he did to Your set-apart ones in Yerushalayim,
{9:14} and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all those calling on Your Name.”
{9:15} But the Master said to him, “Go, for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My Name before nations, sovereigns, and the children of Yisra’ĕl.
{9:16} For I shall show him how much he has to suffer for My Name.
{9:17} And Ḥananyah went away and went into the house. And laying his hands on him he said, “Brother Sha’ul, the Master יהושע, who appeared to you on the way as you came, has sent me, so that you might see again and be filled with the Set-apart Spirit.”
{9:18} And immediately there fell from his eyes, as it were scales, and he received his sight. And rising up, he was immersed.
{9:19} And having received food, he was strengthened. And Sha’ul was with the taught ones at Dammeseq some days.
{9:20} And immediately he proclaimed the Messiah in the congregations, that He is the Son of Elohim.
{9:21} And all who heard were amazed, and said, “Is this not he who destroyed those calling on this Name in Yerushalayim, and has come here for this, to take them bound to the chief priests?”
{9:22} But Sha’ul kept increasing in strength, and was confounding the Yehuḏim who dwelt in Dammeseq, proving that this is the Messiah.
{9:23} And after many days had elapsed, the Yehuḏim plotted to kill him.
{9:24} But their plot became known to Sha’ul. And they were watching the gates day and night, to kill him.
{9:25} But taking him by night, the taught ones let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.
{9:26} And having arrived at Yerushalayim, Sha’ul tried to join the taught ones, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a taught one.
{9:27} But Barnaḇa took him and brought him to the emissaries, and told them how he had seen the Master on the way, and that He had spoken to him, and how he was speaking boldly at Dammeseq in the Name of יהושע.
{9:28} And he was with them at Yerushalayim, coming in and going out,
{9:29} and speaking boldly in the Name of the Master יהושע and disputed with the Hellenists, but they undertook to kill him.
{9:30} And when the brothers learned of this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him out to Tarsos.
{9:31} Then indeed the assemblies throughout all Yehuḏah, and Galil, and Shomeron had peace and were built up, and walking in the fear of יהוה and in the encouragement of the Set-apart Spirit, they were being increased.
{9:32} And it came to be, as Kĕpha was passing through all places, that he also came down to the set-apart ones who were dwelling at Lod.
{9:33} And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, being paralytic.
{9:34} And Kĕpha said to him, “Aeneas, יהושע the Messiah heals you! Rise up and make your bed.” And immediately he rose up.
{9:35} And all those dwelling at Lod and Sharon saw him and did turn to the Master.
{9:36} And in Yapho there was a certain taught one named Taḇitha, which means Dorkas. This woman was filled with good works and kind deeds which she did.
{9:37} And it came to be in those days that she became sick and died. And having washed her, they laid her in an upper room.
{9:38} And Lod being near to Yapho, and the taught ones having heard that Kĕpha was there, they sent two men to him, urging him not to delay in coming to them.
{9:39} And having risen up, Kĕpha went with them. And when he arrived, they brought him to the upper room. And all the widows stood beside him weeping, showing the inner garments and outer garments which Dorkas had made while she was with them.
{9:40} But Kĕpha sent them all out, and knelt down and prayed. And turning to the body he said, “Taḇitha, arise.” And she opened her eyes, and seeing Kĕpha, she sat up.
{9:41} And giving her his hand, he lifted her up. And calling the set-apart ones and widows, he presented her alive.
{9:42} And it became known throughout all Yapho, and many believed on the Master.
{9:43} And it came to be that he stayed for many days in Yapho with Shim‛on, a leather-tanner.
{10:1} Now there was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a captain of what was called the Italian Regiment,
{10:2} dedicated, and fearing Elohim with all his household, doing many kind deeds to the people, and praying to Elohim always.
{10:3} He clearly saw in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, a messenger of Elohim coming to him, and saying to him, “Cornelius!”
{10:4} And looking intently at him, and becoming afraid, he said, “What is it, master?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and your kind deeds have come up for a remembrance before Elohim.
{10:5} “And now send men to Yapho, and send for Shim‛on who is also called Kĕpha.
{10:6} “He is staying with Shim‛on, a leather-tanner, whose house is by the sea.”
{10:7} And when the messenger who spoke to him went away, Cornelius called two of his household servants, and a dedicated soldier from among those who waited on him continually.
{10:8} And having explained to them all, he sent them to Yapho.
{10:9} And on the next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city, Kĕpha went up on the house-top to pray, about the sixth hour.
{10:10} And he became hungry and wished to eat. But while they were preparing, he fell into a trance,
{10:11} and he saw the heaven opened and a certain vessel like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth,
{10:12} in which were all kinds of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping creatures, and the birds of the heaven.
{10:13} And a voice came to him, “Rise up, Kĕpha, slay and eat.”
{10:14} But Kĕpha said, “Not at all, Master! Because I have never eaten whatever is common or unclean.”
{10:15} And a voice came to him again the second time, “What Elohim has cleansed you do not consider common.”
{10:16} And this took place three times, and the vessel was taken back to the heaven.
{10:17} And while Kĕpha was doubting within himself about what the vision might mean, look, the men who had been sent from Cornelius, having asked for the house of Shim‛on, stood at the gate,
{10:18} and calling out, they enquired whether Shim‛on, also known as Kĕpha, was staying there.
{10:19} And as Kĕpha was thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “See, three men seek you.
{10:20} But rise up, go down and go with them, not doubting at all, for I have sent them.
{10:21} So Kĕpha went down to the men who had been sent to him from Cornelius, and said, “Look, I am the one you seek. Why have you come?”
{10:22} And they said, “Cornelius the captain, a righteous man and one who fears Elohim and well spoken of by the entire nation of the Yehuḏim, was instructed by a set-apart messenger to send for you to his house, and to hear words from you.”
{10:23} So inviting them in, he housed them. And on the next day Kĕpha went away with them, and some brothers from Yapho went with him.
{10:24} And the following day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and close friends.
{10:25} And it came to be, that when Kĕpha entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and bowed before him.
{10:26} But Kĕpha raised him up, saying, “Stand up, I myself am also a man.”
{10:27} And talking with him, he went in and found many who had come together.
{10:28} And he said to them, “You know that a Yehuḏi man is not allowed to associate with, or go to one of another race. But Elohim has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
{10:29} That is why I came without hesitation when I was sent for. So I ask, why have you sent for me?
{10:30} And Cornelius said, “Four days ago I was fasting until this hour. And at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and see, a man stood before me in shining garments,
{10:31} and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your kind deeds were remembered before Elohim.
{10:32} Now send to Yapho and call Shim‛on here, who is also called Kĕpha. He is staying in the house of Shim‛on, a leather-tanner, by the sea. When he comes, he shall speak to you.’
{10:33} So I sent to you immediately, and you have done well to come. And now, we are all present before Elohim, to hear all that you have been commanded by Elohim.
{10:34} And opening his mouth, Kĕpha said, “Truly I see that Elohim shows no partiality,
{10:35} but in every nation, he who fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him.
{10:36} “He sent the word to the children of Yisra’ĕl, bringing the Good News: peace through יהושע Messiah! He is Master of all.
{10:37} You know what word came to be throughout all Yehuḏah, beginning from Galil after the immersion which Yoḥanan proclaimed:”
{10:38} how Elohim did anoint יהושע of Natsareth with the Set-apart Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for Elohim was with Him.
{10:39} “And we are witnesses of all He did, both in the country of the Yehuḏim and in Yerushalayim, whom they even killed by hanging on a timber.
{10:40} Elohim raised up this One on the third day, and let Him be seen,”
{10:41} not to all the people, but to witnesses, those having been chosen before by Elohim – to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead.
{10:42} And He commanded us to proclaim to the people, and to witness that it is He who was appointed by Elohim to be Judge of the living and the dead.
{10:43} To this One all the prophets bear witness, that through His Name, everyone believing in Him does receive forgiveness of sins.
{10:44} While Kĕpha was still speaking these words, the Set-apart Spirit fell upon all those hearing the word.
{10:45} And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Kĕpha, because the gift of the Set-apart Spirit had been poured out on the nations also,
{10:46} for they were hearing them speaking with tongues and extolling Elohim. Then Kĕpha answered,
{10:47} Is anyone able to forbid water, that these should not be immersed who have received the Set-apart Spirit – even as also we?
{10:48} And he commanded them to be immersed in the Name of יהושע Messiah. Then they asked him to remain a few days.
{11:1} And the emissaries and brothers who were in Yehuḏah heard that the nations also received the word of Elohim.
{11:2} And when Kĕpha went up to Yerushalayim, those of the circumcision were contending with him,
{11:3} saying, “You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them!”
{11:4} But Kĕpha began and set it forth in order, saying:
{11:5} “I was in the city of Yapho praying. And in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending like a great sheet, let down from the heaven by four corners, and it came to me.
{11:6} “Having looked into it, I perceived and I saw four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping creatures, and the birds of heaven.
{11:7} “And I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Rise up, Kĕpha, slay and eat.’
{11:8} But I said, ‘Not at all, Master! Because whatever is common or unclean has never entered into my mouth.’”
{11:9} “And the voice answered me again from the heaven, ‘What Elohim has cleansed you do not consider common.’
{11:10} “And this took place three times, and all were drawn up again into the heaven.
{11:11} “And see, immediately three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea.
{11:12} “And the Spirit said to me to go with them, not doubting at all. And these six brothers also went with me, and we went into the man’s house.
{11:13} “And he told us how he had seen a messenger standing in his house, who said to him, ‘Send men to Yapho, and call for Shim‛on who is also called Kĕpha,
{11:14} who shall speak to you words, by which you shall be saved, you and all your house.’
{11:15} “And as I began to speak, the Set-apart Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning.
{11:16} “And I remembered the word of the Master, how He said, ‘Yoḥanan indeed immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Set-apart Spirit.’
{11:17} “So if Elohim gave them the same gift as He gave us when we believed on the Master יהושע Messiah, how was I able to withstand Elohim?”
{11:18} And having heard this, they were silent, and praised Elohim, saying, “Then Elohim has indeed also given to the nations repentance to life.”
{11:19} Then, indeed, they who were scattered because of the pressure that arose over Stephanos passed through to Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except the Yehuḏim only.
{11:20} But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, bringing the Good News: the Master יהושע!
{11:21} And the hand of the Master was with them, and a great number having believed turned to the Master.
{11:22} And word of it came to the ears of the assembly in Yerushalayim, and they sent out Barnaḇa to go as far as Antioch,
{11:23} who, having come, and seeing the favour of Elohim, was glad, and encouraged them all with purpose of heart to cleave to the Master.
{11:24} Because he was a good man, and filled with the Set-apart Spirit and with belief. And large numbers were added to the Master.
{11:25} Then Barnaḇa went to Tarsos to seek Sha’ul,
{11:26} and having found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to be that for an entire year they came together in the assembly and taught large numbers. And the taught ones were called ‘messianists’ first in Antioch.
{11:27} And in those days prophets came from Yerushalayim to Antioch.
{11:28} And one of them, named Ḥaḡaḇ, stood up and indicated by the Spirit that there was going to be a great scarcity of food over all the world – which also took place under Claudius Caesar.
{11:29} So the taught ones, each according to his ability, decided to send relief to the brothers dwelling in Yehuḏah.
{11:30} This they also did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnaḇa and Sha’ul.
{12:1} And about that time Herodes the sovereign put forth his hands to do evil to some from the assembly.
{12:2} And he killed Ya‛aqoḇ the brother of Yoḥanan with the sword.
{12:3} And seeing that it was pleasing to the Yehuḏim, he proceeded further to arrest Kĕpha as well – and they were the Days of Unleavened Bread.
{12:4} So when he had seized him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to watch over him, intending to bring him before the people after Pĕsaḥ.
{12:5} So Kĕpha was indeed kept in prison, but prayer was earnestly made to Elohim on his behalf by the assembly.
{12:6} And when Herodes was about to bring him out, that night Kĕpha was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers. And the guards before the door were keeping the prison.
{12:7} And see, a messenger of יהוה stood by, and a light shone in the building. And smiting the side of Kĕpha he raised him up, saying, “Get up quickly!” And his chains fell off his hands.
{12:8} And the messenger said to him, “Gird yourself and bind on your sandals,” and he did so. And he said to him, “Put on your garment and follow me.”
{12:9} And coming out he followed him, and knew not that what was done by the messenger was true, but thought he was seeing a vision.
{12:10} And when they had passed the first and the second guard posts, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened to them by itself. And they went out and went down one street, and the messenger instantly withdrew from him.
{12:11} And when Kĕpha had come to himself, he said, “Now I truly know that יהוה has sent His messenger, and delivered me from the hand of Herodes and from all the Yehuḏi people were anticipating.”
{12:12} And having realised this, he went to the house of Miryam, the mother of Yoḥanan who was also called Marqos, where many had gathered to pray.
{12:13} And when Kĕpha knocked at the door of the gate, a girl named Rhode came to answer.
{12:14} And when she recognised Kĕpha’s voice, she did not open the gate because of her joy, but ran in and reported that Kĕpha stood before the gate.
{12:15} And they said to her, “You are mad!” But she kept insisting that it was so, and they said, “It is his messenger.”
{12:16} And Kĕpha continued knocking, and having opened they saw him and were amazed.
{12:17} And motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he told them how the Master brought him out of the prison. And he said, “Report this to Ya‛aqoḇ and to the brothers.” And he left and went to another place.
{12:18} Now when day came, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Kĕpha.
{12:19} And when Herodes had searched for him and did not find him, he examined the guards and ordered them to be led away. And he went down from Yehuḏah to Caesarea, and stayed there.
{12:20} Now Herodes had been highly displeased with the people of Tsor and Tsiḏon, but with one mind they came to him, and having made Blastos the sovereign’s eunuch their friend, they were asking for peace, because their country was supplied with food by the sovereign’s country.
{12:21} And on an appointed day Herodes, having put on his royal clothes, sat on his throne and gave an address to them.
{12:22} And the people kept shouting, “The voice of a mighty one and not of a man!”
{12:23} And instantly a messenger of יהוה smote him, because he did not give the esteem to Elohim. And becoming worm-eaten, he died.
{12:24} And the word of Elohim went on growing and spreading.
{12:25} And Barnaḇa and Sha’ul returned from Yerushalayim, having completed the service, and having taken with them Yoḥanan who was also called Marqos.
{13:1} And in the assembly that was at Antioch there were certain prophets and teachers: both Barnaḇa and Shim‛on who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaḥĕm who had been brought up with Herodes the district ruler, and Sha’ul.
{13:2} And as they were doing service to the Master and fasted, the Set-apart Spirit said, “Separate unto Me Barnaḇa and Sha’ul for the work to which I have called them.”
{13:3} Then having fasted and prayed, and having laid hands on them, they sent them away.
{13:4} So they, having been sent out by the Set-apart Spirit, went down to Seleukeia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
{13:5} And having come into Salamis, they proclaimed the word of Elohim in the congregations of the Yehuḏim. And they also had Yoḥanan as an attendant.
{13:6} And having passed through all the island to Paphos, they found a certain magician, a false prophet, a Yehuḏi whose name was Bar-Yehoshua,
{13:7} who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. This man, having called for Barnaḇa and Sha’ul, earnestly sought to hear the word of Elohim.
{13:8} But Elumas the magician – for so his name is translated – withstood them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the belief.
{13:9} Then Sha’ul, who also is Paul – filled with the Set-apart Spirit, looked intently at him,
{13:10} and said, “O son of the devil, filled with all deceit and all recklessness, you enemy of all righteousness, shall you not cease perverting the straight ways of יהוה?
{13:11} And now, see, the hand of יהוה is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And instantly a dark mist fell on him, and he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
{13:12} And having seen what took place, the proconsul believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Master.
{13:13} And having put out from Paphos, Sha’ul and those with him came to Perge in Pamphulia. And Yoḥanan, having left them, returned to Yerushalayim.
{13:14} But passing through from Perge, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the congregation on the Sabbath day and sat down.
{13:15} And after the reading of the Torah and the Prophets, the rulers of the congregation sent to them, saying, “Men, brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, speak.”
{13:16} And Sha’ul, standing up and motioning with his hand said, “Men, Yisra’ĕlis, and those fearing Elohim, listen:
{13:17} “The Elohim of this people Yisra’ĕl did choose our fathers, and exalted the people in their sojourning in the land of Mitsrayim, and with a high arm He brought them out of it.
{13:18} “Now for a time of about forty years He sustained them in the wilderness.
{13:19} “And having destroyed seven nations in the land of Kena’an, He gave their land to them as an inheritance.
{13:20} “And after that He gave judges for about four hundred and fifty years, until Shemu’ĕl the prophet.
{13:21} “But then they asked for a sovereign, and Elohim gave them Sha’ul the son of Qish, a man of the tribe of Binyamin, for forty years.
{13:22} And having removed him, He raised up for them Dawiḏ as sovereign, to whom also He gave witness and said, ‘I have found Dawiḏ the son of Yishai, a man after My own heart, who shall do all My desires.’”
{13:23} “From this one’s seed, according to the promise, Elohim raised up for Yisra’ĕl a Saviour, יהושע,
{13:24} after Yoḥanan had first proclaimed the immersion of repentance to all the people of Yisra’ĕl, before His coming.
{13:25} And as Yoḥanan was completing his mission, he said, ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not He. But see, there comes One after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.’”
{13:26} “Men, brothers, sons of the race of Aḇraham, and those among you fearing Elohim, to you the word of this deliverance has been sent,
{13:27} for those dwelling in Yerushalayim, and their rulers, because they did not know Him, nor even the voices of the Prophets which are read every Sabbath, have filled them in having judged Him.
{13:28} “And having found not one cause for death, they asked Pilate that He should be put to death.
{13:29} “And when they had accomplished all that was written concerning Him, taking Him down from the timber, they laid Him in a tomb.
{13:30} But Elohim raised Him from the dead,”
{13:31} and He was seen for many days by those who came up with Him from Galil to Yerushalayim, who are His witnesses to the people.
{13:32} “And we bring you the Good News, the promise made to the fathers,
{13:33} that Elohim has filled this for us, their children, having raised up יהושע, as it has also been written in the second Tehillah, ‘You are My Son, today I have brought You forth.’
{13:34} And that He raised Him out of the dead, no more to return to corruption, He has said thus, ‘I shall give you the trustworthy kindnesses of Dawiḏ.’
{13:35} “For this reason He also says in another Tehillah, ‘You shall not give Your Lovingly-committed One to see corruption.’
{13:36} For Dawiḏ, indeed, having served his own generation by the counsel of Elohim, fell asleep, was buried with his fathers, and saw corruption,”
{13:37} but He whom Elohim raised up saw no corruption.
{13:38} “Let it therefore be known to you, brothers, that through this One forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,
{13:39} “and by Him everyone who believes is declared right from all sins from which you were not able to be declared right by the Torah of Mosheh.
{13:40} “Watch then that what was said in the prophets does not come upon you:
{13:41} “See, you despisers, marvel and perish, for I work a work in your days, a work which you would in no way believe if someone were to declare it to you.’”
{13:42} And when the Yehuḏim went out of the congregation, the nations begged to have these words spoken to them the next Sabbath.
{13:43} And when the meeting of the congregation had broken up, many of the Yehuḏim and of the worshipping converts followed Sha’ul and Barnaḇa, who, speaking to them, were urging them to continue in the favour of Elohim.
{13:44} And on the next Sabbath almost all the city came together to hear the Word of Elohim.
{13:45} But when the Yehuḏim saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy. And contradicting and speaking evil, they opposed what Sha’ul was saying.
{13:46} But speaking boldly, Sha’ul and Barnaḇa said, “It was necessary that the word of Elohim should be spoken to you first, but since you thrust it away, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, see, we turn to the nations.
{13:47} For so the Master has commanded us, ‘I have set you to be a light to the nations, that you should be for deliverance to the ends of the earth.’
{13:48} And when the nations heard this, they were glad and praised the Word of יהוה. And as many as had been appointed to everlasting life believed.
{13:49} And the Word of יהוה was being spread throughout the entire country.
{13:50} But the Yehuḏim stirred up the worshipping and noble women and the chief men of the city, and raised up persecution against Sha’ul and Barnaḇa, and threw them out of their borders.
{13:51} And shaking off the dust from their feet against them, they came to Ikonion.
{13:52} And the taught ones were filled with joy and the Set-apart Spirit.
{14:1} And it came to be in Ikonion that they went together into the congregation of the Yehuḏim, and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Yehuḏim and Greeks believed.
{14:2} But the Yehuḏim who would not obey stirred up the nations and evilly influenced their beings against the brothers.
{14:3} So they remained a long time, speaking boldly in the Master, who was bearing witness to the word of His favour, giving signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
{14:4} And the crowd of the city was divided, and some sided with the Yehuḏim, and some with the emissaries.
{14:5} But when a move took place by both the nations and Yehuḏim, with their rulers, to mistreat and stone them,
{14:6} they became aware of it and fled to Lustra and Derbe, cities of Lukaonia, and the country round about.
{14:7} And they were bringing the Good News there.
{14:8} And in Lustra there was sitting a certain man, disabled in his feet, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who had never walked.
{14:9} This one heard Sha’ul speaking, who, looking intently at him and seeing that he had belief to be healed,
{14:10} said with a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet!” And he sprang up and began to walk.
{14:11} And when the crowds saw what Sha’ul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lukaonian, “The mighty ones have become like men and come down to us!”
{14:12} And they called Barnaḇa Zeus, and Sha’ul Hermes, since he was the chief speaker.
{14:13} And the priest of Zeus, being in front of their city, brought oxen and wreaths to the gates, and wished to offer with the crowds.
{14:14} And when the emissaries Barnaḇa and Sha’ul heard this, they tore their garments and ran in among the crowd, crying out
{14:15} and saying, “Men, why are you doing this? We also are men with the same nature as you, bringing to you the Good News: to turn from these worthless matters to the living Elohim, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all that is in them,
{14:16} who in past generations allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways,
{14:17} though, indeed, He did not leave Himself without witness, doing good – giving us rain from heaven and fruit-bearing seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.”
{14:18} Even with these words they still had difficulty in stopping the crowds from offering to them.
{14:19} But Yehuḏim arrived from Antioch and Ikonion, and having won over the crowds, they stoned Sha’ul, dragged him out of the city, thinking he was dead.
{14:20} But while the taught ones gathered around him, he rose up and went into the city. And on the next day he went away with Barnaḇa to Derbe.
{14:21} And having brought the Good News to that city, and having made many taught ones, they returned to Lustra, and Ikonion, and Antioch,
{14:22} strengthening the beings of the taught ones, encouraging them to continue in the belief, and that through many pressures we have to enter the reign of Elohim.
{14:23} And having appointed elders in every assembly, having prayed with fasting, they committed them to the Master in whom they had believed.
{14:24} And having passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphulia.
{14:25} And having spoken the word in Perge, they went down to Attaleia,
{14:26} and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been committed to the favour of Elohim for the work which they had completed.
{14:27} And having arrived, and having gathered together the assembly, they related all that Elohim had done with them, and that He had opened the door of belief to the nations.
{14:28} And they remained there a long time with the taught ones.
{15:1} And certain men came down from Yehuḏah and were teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised, according to the practice of Mosheh, you are unable to be saved.”
{15:2} So when Sha’ul and Barnaḇa had no small dissension and dispute with them, they arranged for Sha’ul and Barnaḇa and certain others of them to go up to Yerushalayim, to the emissaries and elders, about this question.
{15:3} So, being sent on their way by the assembly, they passed through Phoenicia and Shomeron, relating the conversion of the nations. And they were causing great joy to all the brothers.
{15:4} And having arrived in Yerushalayim, they were received by the assembly and the emissaries and the elders. And they reported all that Elohim had done with them.
{15:5} And some of the believers who belonged to the sect of the Pharisees, rose up, saying, “It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the Torah of Mosheh.”
{15:6} And the emissaries and elders came together to look into this matter.
{15:7} And when there had been much dispute, Kĕpha rose up and said to them, “Men, brothers, you know that a good while ago Elohim chose among us, that by my mouth the nations should hear the word of the Good News and believe.
{15:8} “And Elohim, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Set-apart Spirit, as also to us,
{15:9} and made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by belief.
{15:10} Now then, why do you try Elohim by putting a yoke on the neck of the taught ones which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?”
{15:11} But through the favour of the Master יהושע Messiah we trust to be saved, in the same way as they.
{15:12} And all the crowd was silent and were listening to Barnaḇa and Sha’ul declaring how many miracles and wonders Elohim did among the nations, through them.
{15:13} And after they were silent, Ya‛aqoḇ answered, saying, “Men, brothers, listen to me:
{15:14} “Shim‛on has declared how Elohim first visited the nations to take out of them a people for His Name.
{15:15} And the words of the prophets agree with this, as it has been written.”
{15:16} ‘After this I shall return and rebuild the Booth of Dawiḏ which has fallen down. And I shall rebuild its ruins, and I shall set it up,
{15:17} so that the remnant of mankind shall seek יהוה, even all the nations on whom My Name has been called, says יהוה who is doing all this,’
{15:18} who has made this known from of old.
{15:19} “Therefore I judge that we should not trouble those from among the nations who are turning to Elohim,
{15:20} but that we write to them to abstain from the defilements of idols, and from whoring, and from what is strangled, and from blood.
{15:21} For from ancient generations Mosheh has, in every city, those proclaiming him – being read in the congregations every Sabbath.
{15:22} Then it seemed good to the emissaries and elders, with all the assembly, to send chosen men from among them to Antioch with Sha’ul and Barnaḇa: Yehuḏah being called Barsabba, and Silas, leading men among the brothers,
{15:23} having written by their hand this: The emissaries and the elders and the brothers, To the brothers who are of the nations in Antioch, and Suria, and Kilikia: Greetings.
{15:24} Since we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your lives, to whom we gave no command –
{15:25} it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnaḇa and Sha’ul,
{15:26} men who have given up their lives for the Name of our Master יהושע Messiah.
{15:27} We have therefore sent Yehuḏah and Silas, who are also confirming this by word of mouth.
{15:28} For it seemed good to the Set-apart Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessities:
{15:29} that you abstain from what is offered to idols, and blood, and what is strangled, and whoring. If you keep yourselves from these, you shall do well. Be strong!
{15:30} They, therefore, being sent off, went to Antioch. And having gathered the crowd together, they delivered the letter.
{15:31} And having read it, they rejoiced over its encouragement.
{15:32} And Yehuḏah and Silas, being themselves also prophets, encouraged the brothers with many words and strengthened them.
{15:33} And having spent some time, they were sent back in peace from the brothers to the emissaries.
{15:34} But it seemed good to Silas to remain.
{15:35} And Sha’ul and Barnaḇa continued in Antioch, teaching and bringing, with many others also, the Good News: the Word of יהוה!
{15:36} And after some days Sha’ul said to Barnaḇa, “Let us now go back and visit our brothers in every city where we proclaimed the Word of יהוה, and see how they are.”
{15:37} And Barnaḇa purposed to take with them Yoḥanan called Marqos.
{15:38} But Sha’ul thought it not fit to take with them the one who withdrew from them in Pamphulia, and had not gone with them to the work.
{15:39} A sharp feeling therefore came to be, so that they parted from one another. And so Barnaḇa took Marqos and sailed to Cyprus.
{15:40} And Sha’ul chose Silas and went off, being committed by the brothers to the favour of Elohim.
{15:41} And he went through Suria and Kilikia, strengthening the assemblies.
{16:1} And he came to Derbe and Lustra. And see, a certain taught one was there, named Timotiyos, the son of a certain Yehuḏi woman who believed – but his father was Greek –
{16:2} who was well spoken of by the brothers who were at Lustra and Ikonion.
{16:3} Sha’ul wished to have this one go with him. And he took him and circumcised him because of the Yehuḏim who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was Greek.
{16:4} And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the regulations to keep, which were decided by the emissaries and elders at Yerushalayim.
{16:5} Then, indeed, the assemblies were strengthened in the belief, and increased in number every day.
{16:6} And having passed through Phrygia and the Galatian country, they were forbidden by the Set-apart Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
{16:7} When they came to Musia, they tried to go into Bithunia, but the Spirit did not allow them.
{16:8} And having passed by Musia, they came down to Troas.
{16:9} And in the night a vision appeared to Sha’ul: A man of Makedonia was standing, begging him and saying, “Come over to Makedonia and help us.”
{16:10} And when he saw the vision, immediately we sought to go to Makedonia, concluding that the Master had called us to bring the Good News to them.
{16:11} Therefore, sailing from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrake, and the next day came to Neapolis,
{16:12} and from there to Philippi, which is the principal city of that part of Makedonia, a colony. And we were staying in that city for some days.
{16:13} And on the Sabbath day we went outside the city by a river, where there used to be prayer. And having sat down we were speaking to the women who met there.
{16:14} And a certain woman named Ludia, a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, worshipping Elohim, was hearing, whose heart the Master did open to pay attention to what Sha’ul said.
{16:15} And when she was immersed, and her household, she begged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be believing in the Master, come to my house and stay.” And she urged us.
{16:16} And it came to be, as we went to prayer, that a certain slave girl possessed with a spirit of Puthon, did meet us, who brought her masters much profit by foretelling.
{16:17} Having followed Sha’ul and us, she cried out, saying, “These men are the servants of the Most High Elohim, who proclaim to us the way of deliverance.”
{16:18} And she was doing this for many days. But Sha’ul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the Name of יהושע Messiah to come out of her.” And it came out that same hour.
{16:19} But when her masters saw that their anticipation of money-making was gone, they seized Sha’ul and Silas and dragged them into the market-place to the rulers.
{16:20} And having brought them to the captains, they said, “These men, being Yehuḏim, greatly disturb our city,
{16:21} and they proclaim practices which are not right for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.”
{16:22} And the crowd rose up together against them. And the captains tore off their garments and commanded them to be beaten with rods.
{16:23} And having laid many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them safely,
{16:24} who, having received such a command, put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
{16:25} And at midnight Sha’ul and Silas were praying and singing songs to Elohim, and the prisoners were listening to them.
{16:26} And suddenly a great earthquake took place, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, and immediately all the doors were opened and all the chains came loose.
{16:27} And the jailer, awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, thinking the prisoners had fled, drew his sword and was about to kill himself.
{16:28} But Sha’ul called with a loud voice, saying, “Do no harm to yourself, for we are all here.”
{16:29} And asking for a light, he ran in, and fell down trembling before Sha’ul and Silas.
{16:30} And having led them outside he said, “Masters, what do I have to do to be saved?”
{16:31} And they said, “Believe on the Master יהושע Messiah, and you shall be saved, you and your household.”
{16:32} And they spoke the Word of יהוה to him and to all who were in his house.
{16:33} And taking them in that hour of the night, he washed their wounds, and immediately he was immersed, he and all that were his.
{16:34} And having brought them into his house, he set food before them. And he rejoiced with all his household, having believed in Elohim.
{16:35} And when day came, the authorities sent the officers, saying, “Let these men go.”
{16:36} And the jailer reported these words to Sha’ul, saying, “The captains have sent to let you go. Now then, come out and go in peace.”
{16:37} But Sha’ul said to them, “They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, being Romans. They have thrown us into prison, and now, do they throw us out secretly? No indeed! Let them come themselves and bring us out.”
{16:38} And the officers reported these words to the authorities, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.
{16:39} And having come, they pleaded with them and brought them out, and asked them to leave the city.
{16:40} So coming out of the prison they went to Ludia, and seeing the brothers, they encouraged them, and went forth.
{17:1} And having passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonike, where there was a congregation of the Yehuḏim.
{17:2} And according to his practice, Sha’ul went in unto them, and for three Sabbaths was reasoning with them from the Scriptures,
{17:3} explaining and pointing out that the Messiah had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, “This is the Messiah, יהושע, whom I proclaim to you.”
{17:4} And some of them did believe, and a large number of the worshipping Greeks, and not a few of the leading women, joined Sha’ul and Silas.
{17:5} But the Yehuḏim who did not believe, having become envious, took some of the wicked men from the market-place, and gathering a mob, set all the city in an uproar and came upon the house of Jason, and were seeking to bring them out to the people.
{17:6} But not finding them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers to the city rulers, crying out, “They who have turned the world upside down have come here too,
{17:7} whom Jason has received. And all of them are acting contrary to the dogmas of Caesar, saying there is another sovereign, יהושע.”
{17:8} And they troubled the crowd and the city rulers when they heard this.
{17:9} And when they had received a pledge from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
{17:10} And the brothers immediately sent Sha’ul and Silas away by night to Beroia, who, having come, went into the congregation of the Yehuḏim.
{17:11} Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonike, who received the word with great eagerness, and searched the Scriptures daily, if these words were so.
{17:12} Then many of them truly believed, and also not a few of the Greeks, decent women as well as men.
{17:13} And when the Yehuḏim from Thessalonike came to know that the word of Elohim was proclaimed by Sha’ul at Beroia, they came there also and stirred up the crowds.
{17:14} And then immediately the brothers sent Sha’ul away, to go to the sea, but both Silas and Timotiyos stayed there.
{17:15} And those who arranged for Sha’ul brought him to Athens. And receiving a command for Silas and Timotiyos to join him as soon as possible, they departed.
{17:16} But while Sha’ul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred up within him when he saw that the city was utterly idolatrous.
{17:17} Therefore, indeed, he was reasoning in the congregation with the Yehuḏim and with the worshippers, and in the market-place daily with those who met there.
{17:18} And some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some were saying, “What does this babbler wish to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a proclaimer of strange mighty ones” – because to them he brought the Good News: יהושע and the resurrection!
{17:19} So they laid hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “Are we able to know what this fresh teaching is of which you speak?
{17:20} For you are bringing some strange matters to our ears. We wish, then, to know what these mean.”
{17:21} For all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their leisure time in doing naught but to speak or to hear what is fresh.
{17:22} And having stood in the midst of the Areopagus Sha’ul said, “Men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in every matter.
{17:23} “For passing through and observing the objects of your worship, I even found a slaughter-place with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN MIGHTY ONE. Not knowing then whom you worship, I make Him known to you:
{17:24} יהוה, who made the world and all that is in it, this One being Master of heaven and earth, does not dwell in dwellings made with hands.
{17:25} Nor is He served with men’s hands – as if needing any – Himself giving to all life, and breath, and all else.
{17:26} “And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having ordained beforehand the times and the boundaries of their dwelling,
{17:27} to seek the Master, if at least they would reach out for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.
{17:28} For in Him we live and move and are, as also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also His offspring.’”
{17:29} “Now then, since we are the offspring of Elohim, we should not think that the Elohim is like gold or silver or stone, an image made by the skill and thought of man.
{17:30} Truly, then, having overlooked these times of ignorance, Elohim now commands all men everywhere to repent,”
{17:31} because He has set a day on which He is going to judge the world in righteousness by a Man whom He has appointed, having given proof of this to all by raising Him from the dead.”
{17:32} And hearing of the resurrection of the dead, some indeed mocked, while others said, “We shall hear you again concerning this.”
{17:33} And so Sha’ul went out from among them.
{17:34} But some men joined him and believed, among them Dionusios the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
{18:1} And after this Sha’ul left Athens and went to Corinth.
{18:2} And he found a certain Yehuḏi named Aqulas, born in Pontos, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla – because Claudius had commanded all the Yehuḏim to leave Rome – and he came to them.
{18:3} And because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and was working, for they were tentmakers by trade.
{18:4} And he was reasoning in the congregation every Sabbath, and won over both Yehuḏim and Greeks.
{18:5} And when Silas and Timotiyos came down from Makedonia, Sha’ul was pressed by the Spirit, and earnestly witnessed to the Yehuḏim that יהושע is the Messiah.
{18:6} However, when they resisted and blasphemed, he shook his garments and said to them, “Your blood is upon your head, I am clean. From now on I shall go to the nations.”
{18:7} And having left there he came to the house of a certain man named Justus, who worshipped Elohim, whose house was next to the congregation.
{18:8} And Crispus, the ruler of the congregation, did believe in the Master with all his household. And many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were immersed.
{18:9} And the Master spoke to Sha’ul in the night by a vision, “Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not be silent,
{18:10} because I am with you, and no one shall attack you to do you evil, because I have much people in this city.”
{18:11} And he remained a year and six months, teaching the Word of יהוה among them.
{18:12} And when Gallion was proconsul of Achaia, the Yehuḏim with one mind rose up against Sha’ul and brought him to the judgment seat,
{18:13} saying, “This one does seduce men to worship Elohim contrary to the Torah.”
{18:14} And as Sha’ul was about to open his mouth, Gallion said to the Yehuḏim, “If it were a matter of wrongdoing or wicked recklessness, O Yehuḏim, there would be reason why I should bear with you.
{18:15} But if it is a question of words and names and a law which is among you, see to it yourselves, for I do not wish to be a judge of these matters.”
{18:16} And he drove them away from the judgment seat.
{18:17} And all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the ruler of the congregation, and beat him before the judgment seat. But Gallion showed no concern whatever.
{18:18} And Sha’ul, having stayed several days more, having taken leave of the brothers, was sailing for Suria, and Priscilla and Aqulas were with him, having shaved his hair at Kenḥrea, for he had taken a vow.
{18:19} And he came to Ephesos, and left them there, but he himself went into the congregation and reasoned with the Yehuḏim.
{18:20} And when they asked him to stay a longer time with them, he declined,
{18:21} but took leave of them, saying, “I have to keep this coming festival in Yerushalayim by all means, but I shall come back to you, Elohim desiring so.” And he sailed from Ephesos.
{18:22} And having come to Caesarea, going up and greeting the assembly, he went down to Antioch.
{18:23} And having spent some time there, he went forth, passing through the country of Galatia and on through Phrygia, strengthening all the taught ones.
{18:24} And a certain Yehuḏi named Apollos, born at Alexandria, a learned man and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesos.
{18:25} This one had been instructed in the way of the Master. And being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and teaching the matters about the Master exactly, though he knew only the immersion of Yoḥanan.
{18:26} And he began to speak boldly in the congregation. And when Aqulas and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of Elohim more exactly.
{18:27} And when he intended to pass through to Achaia, the brothers, having encouraged him, wrote to the taught ones to receive him, who, having arrived, greatly helped those who believed through favour,
{18:28} for with power he refuted the Yehuḏim publicly, showing from the Scriptures that יהושע is the Messiah.
{19:1} And it came to be, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Sha’ul, having passed through the upper parts, came to Ephesos. And having found some taught ones,
{19:2} he said to them, “Did you receive the Set-apart Spirit when you believed?” And they said to him, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Set-apart Spirit.”
{19:3} And he said to them, “Into what then were you immersed?” And they said, “Into Yoḥanan’s immersion.”
{19:4} And Sha’ul said, “Yoḥanan indeed immersed with an immersion of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the One who is coming after him, that is, in Messiah יהושע.”
{19:5} And when they heard this, they were immersed into the Name of the Master יהושע.
{19:6} And when Sha’ul had laid hands on them, the Set-apart Spirit came upon them, and they were speaking in tongues and prophesying.
{19:7} And all the men were about twelve.
{19:8} And having gone into the congregation he spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading concerning the reign of Elohim.
{19:9} But when some were hardened and did not believe, speaking evil of the Way before the crowd, he withdrew from them and separated the taught ones, reasoning daily in the school of Turannos.
{19:10} And this took place for two years, so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Master יהושע, both Yehuḏim and Greeks.
{19:11} And Elohim worked unusual miracles through the hands of Sha’ul,
{19:12} so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the wicked spirits went out of them.
{19:13} But certain roving Yehuḏi exorcists took it upon themselves to call the Name of the Master יהושע over those who had wicked spirits, saying, “We exorcise you by יהושע whom Sha’ul proclaims.”
{19:14} And there were seven sons of a certain Skeua, a Yehuḏi chief priest, who were doing this.
{19:15} And the wicked spirit answering, said, “יהושע I know, and Sha’ul I know, but who are you?”
{19:16} And the man in whom the wicked spirit was leaped on them, overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
{19:17} And this became known to all, both Yehuḏim and Greeks dwelling in Ephesos. And fear fell on them all, and the Name of the Master יהושע was made great.
{19:18} And many who had believed came confessing and declaring their deeds.
{19:19} And many of those who had practised magic brought their books together, burning them before all. And they reckoned up the value of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.
{19:20} So the word of the Master was growing mightily and prevailing.
{19:21} Now when these matters had been completed, Sha’ul purposed in the Spirit, when he had passed through Makedonia and Achaia, to go to Yerushalayim, saying, “After I have been there, I have to see Rome too.”
{19:22} And having sent into Makedonia two of those assisting him, Timotiyos and Ěrastos, he himself remained in Asia for a time.
{19:23} And about that time there came to be a great commotion about the Way.
{19:24} For a certain man named Demetrios, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, provided no little business to the craftsmen,
{19:25} who, having called them together, with the workers of similar trade, said, “Men, you know that our wealth is from this business.
{19:26} “And you see and hear that not only at Ephesos, but throughout almost all Asia, this Sha’ul has persuaded and turned away a large number, saying that they are not mighty ones which are made with hands.
{19:27} “And not only is this trade of ours in danger of coming to rejection, but also that the temple of the great female mighty one Artemis whom all Asia and the world worship, shall be regarded as worthless and her greatness diminished.”
{19:28} And having heard this, they were filled with rage and cried out, saying, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
{19:29} And the entire city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one mind into the theatre, having seized Gaios and Aristarchos, Makedonians, Sha’ul’s fellow travellers.
{19:30} And Sha’ul, intending to go in among the mob, the taught ones did not allow him.
{19:31} And some of the officials of Asia, being his friends, sent to him begging him not to risk himself into the theatre.
{19:32} Then others indeed shouted this and others that, for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come together.
{19:33} And some of the crowd instructed Alexander – the Yehuḏim putting him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, and wished to make his defence to the people.
{19:34} But having recognised that he was a Yehuḏi, all with one voice cried out for about two hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
{19:35} And the city clerk, having calmed the crowd, said, “Men of Ephesos, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the guardian of the temple of the great female mighty one Artemis, and of that which fell down from Zeus?
{19:36} Therefore, if these matters are undeniable, you need to be calm, and do not act rashly.
{19:37} “For you have brought these men here who are neither temple-robbers nor speaking evil of your female mighty one.
{19:38} “If truly then Demetrios and his fellow craftsmen have a case against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. Let them accuse one another.
{19:39} “And if you have any further complaint, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.
{19:40} “For we are in danger of being accused of riot concerning today, there being no reason which we could give to account for this disorderly gathering.”
{19:41} And having said this, he dismissed the assembly.
{20:1} After the uproar had ceased, Sha’ul called the taught ones to him, and having embraced them, went away to go to Makedonia.
{20:2} And having gone through those parts, and having encouraged them with many words, he came to Greece,
{20:3} where he spent three months. When he was about to sail to Suria, he decided to return through Makedonia, as a plot was made against him by the Yehuḏim.
{20:4} And he was accompanied by Sopater of Beroia, and Aristarchos and Sekundos of the Thessalonians, and Gaios of Derbe, and Timotiyos, and Tuchikos and Trophimos of Asia.
{20:5} And these, going ahead, waited for us at Troas.
{20:6} And we sailed away from Philippi after the Days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.
{20:7} And on day one of the week, the taught ones having gathered together to break bread, Sha’ul, intending to depart the next day, was reasoning with them and was extending the word till midnight.
{20:8} And there were many lamps in the upper room where they were assembled.
{20:9} And a certain young man, by name Eutuchos, was sitting in a window, being overpowered by a deep sleep. As Sha’ul kept on reasoning, he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third story, and was picked up dead.
{20:10} And Sha’ul, having gone down, fell on him, and embracing him said, “Do not be upset, for his life is in him.”
{20:11} Then going up again, and having broken bread and eaten, he talked a long while, even till daybreak, and so went forth.
{20:12} And they brought the young man in alive, and were encouraged, not a little.
{20:13} And we, going ahead to the ship, sailed to Assos, intending to take Sha’ul on board there, for so he had arranged, intending himself to go on foot.
{20:14} And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitulene.
{20:15} And from there we sailed, and the next day came opposite Chios. And the next day we arrived at Samos and remained at Trogullion. And the following day we came to Miletos.
{20:16} For Sha’ul had decided to sail past Ephesos, so that he might lose no time in Asia, for he was hurrying to be at Yerushalayim, if possible, on the Day of the Festival of Shaḇu’ot.
{20:17} And from Miletos he sent to Ephesos and called for the elders of the assembly.
{20:18} And when they had come to him, he said to them, “You know, from the first day that I came to Asia, how I was with you all the time,
{20:19} serving the Master with all humility, with many tears and trials which befell me by the plotting of the Yehuḏim,
{20:20} as I kept back no matter that was profitable, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house,
{20:21} witnessing to Yehuḏim, and also to Greeks: repentance toward Elohim and belief in our Master יהושע Messiah.
{20:22} “And now see, I go bound in the spirit to Yerushalayim, not knowing what is going to meet me there,
{20:23} except that the Set-apart Spirit witnesses in every city, saying that chains and pressures await me.
{20:24} “But I do not count my life of any value to me, so that I might accomplish my mission with joy, and the service which I received from the Master יהושע, to bear witness to the Good News of the favour of Elohim.
{20:25} “And now see, I know that you all, among whom I went about proclaiming the reign of Elohim, shall see my face no more.
{20:26} “Therefore I witness to you this day that I am clear from the blood of all.
{20:27} “For I kept not back from declaring to you all the counsel of Elohim.
{20:28} “Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Set-apart Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of Elohim which He has purchased with His own blood.
{20:29} “For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves shall come in among you, not sparing the flock.
{20:30} “Also from among yourselves men shall arise, speaking distorted teachings, to draw away the taught ones after themselves.
{20:31} “Therefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease to warn each one with tears.
{20:32} “And now, brothers, I commit you to Elohim and to the word of His favour, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those having been set apart.
{20:33} “I have coveted no one’s silver or gold or garments.
{20:34} “And you yourselves know that these hands supplied my needs, and for those who were with me.
{20:35} “All this I did show you, by labouring like this, that you ought to help the weak. And remember the words of the Master יהושע, that He said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”
{20:36} And having said this, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
{20:37} And there was much weeping among them all, and falling on Sha’ul’s neck, they kissed him,
{20:38} distressed most of all because of the word which he had said, that they would see his face no more. And they went with him to the ship.
{21:1} And it came to be, when we had torn ourselves away from them, and had set sail, we ran a straight course and came to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
{21:2} And having found a ship passing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.
{21:3} And having sighted Cyprus, and having passed it on the left, we sailed to Suria, and landed at Tsor, for the ship was to unload her cargo there.
{21:4} And having found taught ones, we remained there seven days. And they told Sha’ul through the Spirit not to go up to Yerushalayim.
{21:5} And when it came to be that our days there were ended, we left and went on, all of them accompanying us, with wives and children, till we were out of the city. And kneeling down on the beach, we prayed.
{21:6} And having embraced one another, we boarded the ship, and they returned to their homes.
{21:7} And when we had completed our voyage from Tsor, we came to Ptolemais. And having greeted the brothers we stayed with them one day.
{21:8} And on the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and went into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.
{21:9} Now this one had four maiden daughters who prophesied.
{21:10} And as we were staying many days, a certain prophet named Ḥaḡaḇ came down from Yehuḏah,
{21:11} and having come to us, he took the girdle of Sha’ul, bound his own hands and feet, and said, “Thus says the Set-apart Spirit, ‘Thus shall the Yehuḏim at Yerushalayim bind the man who owns this girdle, and deliver him into the hands of the nations.’”
{21:12} And when we heard this, both we and those from that place begged him not to go up to Yerushalayim.
{21:13} And Sha’ul answered, “What do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Yerushalayim for the Name of the Master יהושע.”
{21:14} And as he could not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, “Let the desire of the Master be done.”
{21:15} And after those days, having made ready, we went up to Yerushalayim.
{21:16} And also some of the taught ones from Caesarea went with us and brought with them one, Mnason of Cyprus, an early taught one, with whom we were to lodge.
{21:17} And when we had arrived in Yerushalayim, the brothers received us gladly.
{21:18} And on the following day Sha’ul went in with us to Ya‛aqoḇ, and all the elders came.
{21:19} And having greeted them, he was relating one by one what Elohim had done among the nations through his service.
{21:20} And when they heard it, they praised the Master. And they said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands of Yehuḏim there are who have believed, and all are ardent for the Torah,
{21:21} “But they have been informed about you that you teach all the Yehuḏim who are among the nations to forsake Mosheh, saying not to circumcise the children nor to walk according to the practices.
{21:22} “What then is it? They shall certainly hear that you have come.
{21:23} “So do this, what we say to you: We have four men who have taken a vow.
{21:24} Take them and be cleansed with them, and pay their expenses so that they shave their heads. And all shall know that what they have been informed about you is not so, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the Torah.
{21:25} “But concerning the nations who believe, we have written and decided that they should keep themselves from what is offered to idols, and blood, and what is strangled, and whoring.”
{21:26} Then Sha’ul took the men on the next day, and having been cleansed with them, went into the Set-apart Place to announce the completion of the days of separation – until the offering should be presented for each one of them.
{21:27} And when the seven days were almost ended, the Yehuḏim from Asia, seeing him in the Set-apart Place, were stirring up all the crowd, and they laid hands on him,
{21:28} crying out, “Men of Yisra’ĕl, help! This is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against the people, and the Torah, and this place. And besides, he also brought Greeks into the Set-apart Place and has profaned this Set-apart Place.”
{21:29} Because they had previously seen Trophimos the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they thought that Sha’ul had brought into the Set-apart Place.
{21:30} And the entire city was moved, and the people rushed together, seized Sha’ul, and dragged him out of the Set-apart Place. And immediately the doors were shut.
{21:31} And while they were seeking to kill him, a report came to the commander of the company of soldiers that all Yerushalayim was in confusion.
{21:32} At once he took soldiers and captains, and ran down to them. And they, having seen the commander and the soldiers, stopped beating Sha’ul.
{21:33} Then the commander came near and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains, and was asking who he was and what he had done.
{21:34} And in the crowd some were shouting this and others that. And not being able to ascertain the truth because of the uproar, he commanded him to be taken into the barracks.
{21:35} And when he came to the stairs, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd.
{21:36} For a large number of the people followed after, crying out, “Away with him!”
{21:37} And as Sha’ul was about to be led into the barracks, he said to the commander, “Am I allowed to say somewhat to you?” And he said, “Do you know Greek?
{21:38} “Are you not the Mitsrian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?
{21:39} But Sha’ul replied, “I am a Yehuḏi from Tarsos, in Kilikia, a citizen of no mean city. And I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.”
{21:40} And having given him permission, Sha’ul, standing on the stairs motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he spoke in the Hebrew language, saying,
{22:1} “Men, brothers, and fathers, hear my defence before you now.”
{22:2} And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they kept greater silence. And he said:
{22:3} “I am indeed a Yehuḏi, having been born in Tarsos of Kilikia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamli’ĕl, having been instructed according to the exactness of the Torah of our fathers, being ardent for Elohim, as you all are today,
{22:4} who persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering up into prisons both men and women,
{22:5} as also the high priest bears me witness, and all the eldership, from whom I also received letters to the brothers, and went to Dammeseq to bring in chains even those who were there to Yerushalayim to be punished.
{22:6} And it came to be, as I was journeying and coming near Dammeseq, about noon, suddenly a great light shone around me out of the heaven,”
{22:7} and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Sha’ul, Sha’ul, why do you persecute Me?’
{22:8} “And I answered, ‘Who are You, Master?’ And He said to me, ‘I am יהושע of Natsareth, whom you persecute.’
{22:9} “And those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they did not hear His voice speaking to me.
{22:10} “And I said, ‘What shall I do, Master?’ And the Master said to me, ‘Rise up, go into Dammeseq, and there you shall be told all that you have been appointed to do.’
{22:11} “And as I could not see because of the esteem of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Dammeseq.
{22:12} And a certain Ḥananyah, a dedicated man according to the Torah, being well spoken of by all the Yehuḏim dwelling there,
{22:13} came to me, and stood by and said to me, ‘Brother Sha’ul, look up.’ And at that same hour I looked up at him.
{22:14} “And he said, ‘The Elohim of our fathers has appointed you to know His desire, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear the voice from His mouth.
{22:15} Because you shall be His witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.
{22:16} And now, why do you delay? Rise up, be immersed, and wash away your sins, calling on the Name of יהוה.’
{22:17} And it came to be, when I returned to Yerushalayim, and while I was praying in the Set-apart Place, I came to be in a trance,”
{22:18} and I saw Him saying to me, ‘Hurry and get out of Yerushalayim, speedily, because they shall not accept your witness concerning Me.’
{22:19} “And I said, ‘Master, they know that in every congregation I was imprisoning and beating those who believe on You.
{22:20} And when the blood of Your witness Stephanos was shed, I also was standing by giving my approval to his death, and keeping the garments of those who were killing him.’
{22:21} “And He said to me, ‘Go, because I shall send you far from here to the nations.’”
{22:22} And they were listening to him until this word, and then they lifted up their voice, saying, “Away with such a one from the earth, for it is not fit that he should live!”
{22:23} As they were shouting and tearing their garments, and throwing dust into the air,
{22:24} the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and said that he should be examined by flogging, in order to find out why they were shouting so against him.
{22:25} And as they were stretching him out with straps, Sha’ul said to the captain who was standing by, “Is it permitted for you to whip a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?”
{22:26} And when the captain heard, he went and reported to the commander, saying, “Watch what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman.”
{22:27} And having come, the commander said to him, “Say to me, are you a Roman?” And he said, “Yes.”
{22:28} And the commander answered, “With a large sum I obtained this citizenship.” And Sha’ul said, “But I was even born so.”
{22:29} Then at once those who were about to examine him withdrew from him. And the commander was also afraid after he found out that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
{22:30} And on the next day, intending to know for certain why he was accused by the Yehuḏim, he released him, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to come, and brought Sha’ul down and set him before them.
{23:1} And Sha’ul, looking intently at the council, said, “Men, brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before Elohim until this day.”
{23:2} And the high priest Ḥananyah commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.
{23:3} Then Sha’ul said to him, “Elohim is going to strike you, whitewashed wall! And do you sit judging me according to the Torah, and do you command me to be struck contrary to the Torah?”
{23:4} And those who stood by said, “Do you revile the high priest of Elohim?”
{23:5} And Sha’ul said, “I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it has been written, ‘You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.’”
{23:6} Now Sha’ul, perceiving that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, cried out in the council, “Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee, I am being judged concerning the expectation and resurrection of the dead!”
{23:7} And when he had said this, there came a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. And the crowd was divided.
{23:8} For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor messenger nor spirit, but the Pharisees confess both.
{23:9} And there was a great uproar. And certain of the scribes of the party of Pharisees were earnestly contending, saying, “We find no evil in this man. And if a spirit or a messenger has spoken to him, let us not fight against Elohim.”
{23:10} And a great dissension having come, the commander, fearing lest Sha’ul would be pulled to pieces by them, commanded the body of soldiers to go down and seize him from their midst, and bring him into the barracks.
{23:11} And on the following night the Master stood by him and said, “Take courage, Sha’ul, for as you have witnessed for Me in Yerushalayim, so you have to bear witness at Rome too.”
{23:12} And when it became day, some of the Yehuḏim made a conspiracy and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Sha’ul.
{23:13} And those making this conspiracy were more than forty,
{23:14} who, having come to the chief priests and elders, said, “We have bound ourselves under a great oath not to eat at all until we have killed Sha’ul.
{23:15} Now, then, you, with the council, inform the commander to have him brought down to you tomorrow, as intending to examine more exactly all about him. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near.
{23:16} And when Sha’ul’s sister’s son heard of their ambush, he went and entered into the barracks and reported to Sha’ul.
{23:17} And Sha’ul, having called one of the captains to him, said, “Take this young man to the commander, for he has somewhat to report to him.”
{23:18} He indeed then took him and led him to the commander and said, “The prisoner Sha’ul called me to him and asked me to bring this young man to you, having somewhat to say to you.”
{23:19} And the commander, having taken him by the hand, went aside by themselves and asked, “What is it that you have to report to me?”
{23:20} And he said, “The Yehuḏim have agreed to ask that you bring Sha’ul down to the council tomorrow, as intending to inquire more exactly about him.
{23:21} Therefore, do not let them persuade you, for more than forty of them lie in wait for him, men who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.
{23:22} Then the commander dismissed the young man, having commanded him, “Inform no one that you reported this to me.”
{23:23} And having called near a certain two captains, he said, “Get two hundred soldiers ready to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, after the third hour of the night,
{23:24} and provide beasts, on which to place Sha’ul, and bring him safely to Felix the governor,”
{23:25} having written a letter in this form:
{23:26} Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.
{23:27} This man, having been seized by the Yehuḏim, and being about to be killed by them, I rescued, having come with the body of soldiers, having learned that he was a Roman.
{23:28} And, desiring to know the reason they accused him, I brought him before their council.
{23:29} I found out that he was accused concerning questions of their Torah, but there was no charge against him deserving death or chains.
{23:30} And when I was informed that there was to be a plot against the man by the Yehuḏim, I sent him immediately to you, having also commanded his accusers to state before you the charges against him. Be strong!
{23:31} So the soldiers, as they were commanded, took Sha’ul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
{23:32} And on the next day they left the horsemen to go on with him, and returned to the barracks,
{23:33} who, having come to Caesarea, and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Sha’ul to him.
{23:34} And the governor, having read it, and having asked of what province he was, and being informed that he was from Kilikia,
{23:35} said, “I shall hear you when your accusers arrive also.” And he commanded him to be kept in Herodes’ palace.
{24:1} And after five days the high priest Ḥananyah came down, with the elders, and a certain speaker – Tertullus. And they brought charges against Sha’ul before the governor.
{24:2} And when he was called upon, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “Having obtained great peace through you, and reforms being brought to this nation by your forethought,
{24:3} we accept it always and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thanks.
{24:4} “But in order not to hinder you any further, I beg you to hear us briefly in your gentleness.
{24:5} For having found this man a plague, who stirs up dissension among all the Yehuḏim throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Natsarenes,”
{24:6} who also tried to profane the Set-apart Place, and whom we seized, and wished to judge him according to our law,
{24:7} but the commander Lysias came along and with much violence took him out of our hands,
{24:8} commanding his accusers to come to you. And by examining him yourself you shall be able to know all these matters of which we accuse him.”
{24:9} And the Yehuḏim also agreed, maintaining that these matters were so.
{24:10} And when the governor had motioned him to speak, Sha’ul answered, “Knowing that for many years you have been a judge of this nation, I gladly defend myself,
{24:11} seeing you are able to know that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Yerushalayim to worship.
{24:12} “And they neither found me in the Set-apart Place disputing with anyone nor stirring up the crowd, either in the congregations or in the city.
{24:13} “Nor are they able to prove the charges of which they now accuse me.
{24:14} “And this I confess to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so I worship the Elohim of my fathers, believing all that has been written in the Torah and in the Prophets,
{24:15} having an expectation in Elohim, which they themselves also wait for, that there is to be a resurrection of the dead, both of the righteous and the unrighteous.
{24:16} “And in this I exercise myself to have a clear conscience toward Elohim and men always.
{24:17} “And after many years I came to bring kind deeds to my nation and offerings,
{24:18} at which time certain Yehuḏim from Asia found me cleansed in the Set-apart Place, neither with a crowd nor with disturbance,
{24:19} “who ought to be present before you to bring charges if they have any matter against me.
{24:20} “Or else let these themselves say if they found any wrongdoing in me while I stood before the council,
{24:21} other than for this one declaration which I cried out, standing among them, ‘Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you today.’”
{24:22} And having heard this, having known more exactly about the Way, Felix put them off, saying, “When Lysias the commander comes down, I shall decide your case.”
{24:23} And he ordered the captain to keep Sha’ul and to have ease, and not to forbid any of his friends to attend to him.
{24:24} And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a female Yehuḏi, he sent for Sha’ul and heard him concerning the belief in Messiah.
{24:25} And as he reasoned about righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, “For the present, go. And when I find time I shall send for you.”
{24:26} At the same time too he was anticipating that money would be given him by Sha’ul, that he might release him. Therefore he sent for him more often and conversed with him.
{24:27} But after two years had passed Porcius Festus succeeded Felix. And wishing to do the Yehuḏim a favour, Felix left Sha’ul bound.
{25:1} Festus therefore, having come to the province, three days later went up from Caesarea to Yerushalayim.
{25:2} And the high priest and the chief men of the Yehuḏim informed him against Sha’ul, and they begged him,
{25:3} asking a favour against him, that he would send him to Yerushalayim – making a plot along the way to kill him.
{25:4} Then, indeed, Festus answered that Sha’ul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to set out shortly.
{25:5} Therefore, he said, “let those who have authority among you go down with me and accuse this man, to see if there is any fault in him.”
{25:6} And having spent more than ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea. And on the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded Sha’ul to be brought.
{25:7} And when he had come, the Yehuḏim who had come down from Yerushalayim stood about, bringing many and heavy charges against Sha’ul, which they were unable to prove,
{25:8} while Sha’ul said in his own defence, “Neither against the Torah of the Yehuḏim, nor against the Set-apart Place, nor against Caesar did I commit any sin.”
{25:9} But Festus, wishing to do the Yehuḏim a favour, answering Sha’ul, said, “Do you wish to go up to Yerushalayim and be judged before me there concerning these matters?”
{25:10} And Sha’ul said, “I am standing at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I should be judged. To the Yehuḏim I have done no wrong, as you know well enough.
{25:11} For if indeed I do wrong, or have committed whatever deserving death, I do not refuse to die. But if there is none at all in these matters of which these men accuse me, no one is able to give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.”
{25:12} Then Festus, having talked with the council, answered, “You have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go!”
{25:13} And certain days having passed, Sovereign Agrippa and Bernike came to Caesarea to greet Festus.
{25:14} And when they had spent many days there, Festus laid Sha’ul’s case before the sovereign, saying, “There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner,
{25:15} about whom the chief priests and the elders of the Yehuḏim informed me, when I was in Yerushalayim, asking for a judgment against him.
{25:16} “To them I answered, ‘It is not the Roman practice to give up any man to destruction before the accused meets the accusers face to face, and has a chance to answer for himself concerning the charge against him.’
{25:17} “They, therefore, having come together, without any delay, I sat on the judgment seat the next day and commanded the man to be brought in.
{25:18} “When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge against him such as I expected,
{25:19} but had some questions against him about their own worship and about a certain יהושע, who had died, whom Sha’ul was claiming to be alive.
{25:20} “And being uncertain how to investigate these matters, I asked whether he wished to go to Yerushalayim and there be judged concerning these matters.
{25:21} But when Sha’ul appealed to be kept for the decision of Augustus, I ordered him to be kept until I send him to Caesar.
{25:22} And Agrippa said to Festus, “I was wishing also to hear the man myself.” And he said, “Tomorrow, you shall hear him.”
{25:23} Therefore, on the next day, Agrippa and Bernike having come with great show, and having entered the place of hearing with the commanders and the eminent men of the city, Sha’ul was brought in at the order of Festus.
{25:24} And Festus said, “Sovereign Agrippa and all the men present here with us, you see this one about whom all the community of the Yehuḏim pleaded with me, both at Yerushalayim and here, shouting that he ought not to be living any longer.
{25:25} “But I, having found that he had committed none at all deserving death, and that he himself had appealed to Augustus, I decided to send him.
{25:26} “I have no definite matter to write to my master concerning him. Therefore I have brought him out before you, and most of all before you, Sovereign Agrippa, so that after the examination has taken place I might have somewhat to write.
{25:27} For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to signify the charges against him.
{26:1} And Agrippa said to Sha’ul, “You are allowed to speak for yourself.” Then Sha’ul stretched out his hand and made his defence:
{26:2} “I think myself blessed, Sovereign Agrippa, because today I shall make my defence before you concerning all of which I am accused by the Yehuḏim,
{26:3} you being most of all an expert, knowing of all practices and questions which have to do with the Yehuḏim. So, please hear me patiently.
{26:4} Truly, then, all the Yehuḏim know my way of life from youth, which I led from the beginning among my own nation at Yerushalayim,”
{26:5} since they have known me from the first, if they wish to witness, that I lived as a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our observance.
{26:6} “And now I stand and am judged for the expectation of the promise made by Elohim to our fathers,
{26:7} to which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving Elohim night and day, expect to attain. Concerning this expectation, O Sovereign Agrippa, I am accused by the Yehuḏim.
{26:8} Why is it considered ‘unbelievable’ among you if Elohim raises the dead?”
{26:9} “Therefore, indeed, I thought within myself that I ought to do much against the Name of יהושע of Natsareth,
{26:10} which also I did in Yerushalayim, and I shut up many of the set-apart ones in prison, having received authority from the chief priests. And when they were put to death, I gave my vote against them.
{26:11} “And punishing them often in all the congregations, I compelled them to blaspheme. And being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
{26:12} “While thus engaged, as I was journeying to Dammeseq with authority and commission from the chief priests,
{26:13} at midday along the highway, O sovereign, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me.
{26:14} And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew language, ‘Sha’ul, Sha’ul, why do you persecute Me? It is hard for you to kick against the prods.’
{26:15} “And I said, ‘Who are You, Master?’ And He said, ‘I am יהושע, whom you persecute.
{26:16} But rise up, and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you a servant and a witness both of what you saw and of those which I shall reveal to you,
{26:17} delivering you from the people, and the nations, to whom I now send you,
{26:18} to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, and the authority of Satan to Elohim, in order for them to receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are set-apart by belief in Me.’
{26:19} “Therefore, Sovereign Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,
{26:20} but declared first to those in Dammeseq and in Yerushalayim, and in all the country of Yehuḏah, and to the nations, that they should repent, and turn to Elohim, and do works worthy of repentance.
{26:21} “That is why the Yehuḏim seized me in the Set-apart Place and tried to kill me.
{26:22} “Therefore, having obtained help from Elohim, to this day I stand, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other than what the prophets and Mosheh said would come –
{26:23} that the Messiah would suffer, would be the first to rise from the dead, He would proclaim light to the people and to the nations.”
{26:24} And while saying this in his defence, Festus said with a loud voice, “Sha’ul, you are mad! Much learning is turning you to madness!”
{26:25} But Sha’ul said, “I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I speak words of truth and sense.
{26:26} “For the sovereign, before whom I also speak boldly, knows these matters. For I am persuaded that none of these are hidden from him, for this has not been done in a corner.
{26:27} “Sovereign Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you do believe.
{26:28} And Agrippa said to Sha’ul, “With a little you might persuade me to become a 'messianist’!”
{26:29} And Sha’ul said, “Much or little, I pray to Elohim that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might become such as I also am, except for these chains.”
{26:30} And having said this, the sovereign stood up, as well as the governor and Bernike and those sitting with them,
{26:31} and having withdrawn, they spoke to each other, saying, “This man is doing none at all deserving death or chains.”
{26:32} And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.”
{27:1} And when it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Sha’ul and some other prisoners to one named Julius, a captain of the Augustan regiment.
{27:2} And having embarked in a ship from Adramyttium, about to sail along the coasts of Asia, did set sail. Aristarchos, a Makedonian of Thessalonike, was with us.
{27:3} And on the next day we landed at Tsiḏon. And Julius treated Sha’ul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to receive attention.
{27:4} And from there we put out to sea and sailed close to Cyprus, because the winds were against us.
{27:5} And having sailed over the sea along Kilikia and Pamphulia, we came to Mura, of Lukia.
{27:6} And there the captain, having found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, did put us on board.
{27:7} And having sailed slowly many days, and arriving with difficulty off Knidos, the wind not allowing us to proceed, we sailed close to Crete, off Salmone.
{27:8} And passing it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.
{27:9} And much time having passed, and the sailing now being dangerous, because the Fast was already over, Sha’ul advised them,
{27:10} saying, “Men, I see that this voyage is going to end with damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and ship, but also our lives.”
{27:11} But the captain was persuaded by the pilot and the owner of the ship, rather than what Sha’ul said.
{27:12} And because the harbour was unsuitable to winter in, the greater part advised to set sail from there too, if somehow they were able to reach Phoenix, a harbour of Crete facing southwest and northwest, to pass the winter.
{27:13} And a south wind blowing softly, thinking they had obtained their purpose, having lifted anchor, they sailed along Crete, close inshore.
{27:14} And not long after, a stormy head wind rushed down from it, called Northeaster.
{27:15} And when the ship was caught in it, and unable to head against the wind, we let her go and were driven.
{27:16} And having run under a small island called Klauda, we were hardly able to control the small boat.
{27:17} And having hoisted it, they used helps to undergird the ship. And fearing lest they should run aground on Surtis, they lowered the tackle and so were driven.
{27:18} And because we were exceedingly storm-tossed, the next day they began to throw overboard.
{27:19} And on the third day we threw out the ship’s tackle with our own hands.
{27:20} When, now, neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm beat on us, all expectancy that we would be saved was taken away.
{27:21} And when there had been a long abstinence from food, then Sha’ul, standing in the midst of them, said, “Truly, men, you should have listened to me not to have sailed from Crete and sustained this damage and loss.
{27:22} “And now I urge you to take courage, for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
{27:23} For tonight a messenger of the Elohim to whom I belong and whom I serve, stood by me,”
{27:24} saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Sha’ul, you have to be brought before Caesar. And look, Elohim has favourably given you all those who sail with you.’
{27:25} “Therefore take courage, men, for I believe Elohim that it shall be according to the way it was spoken to me.
{27:26} “However, we need to run aground on some island.”
{27:27} And when the fourteenth night came, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were drawing near some land.
{27:28} So, taking soundings, they found it to be twenty fathoms. And a little farther on they took soundings again and found it to be fifteen fathoms.
{27:29} And, fearing lest we should run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern, and were praying for day to come.
{27:30} But when the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under pretence of going to cast out anchors from the prow,
{27:31} Sha’ul said to the captain and the soldiers, “If these do not remain in the ship, it is impossible for you to be saved.”
{27:32} Then the soldiers did cut the ropes of the boat and let it fall off.
{27:33} And when day was about to come, Sha’ul urged them all to take food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day you have continued without food, and eaten none at all.
{27:34} So I urge you to take food, for this concerns your safety, since not a hair shall fall from the head of any of you.
{27:35} And having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to Elohim in the presence of them all. And when he had broken it he began to eat.
{27:36} And they were all encouraged, and also took food themselves.
{27:37} And all of us were two hundred and seventy-six beings in the ship.
{27:38} And being satisfied with food, they were lightening the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.
{27:39} And when day came, they did not recognise the land, but they noted a certain bay with a beach, onto which they planned to run the ship if possible.
{27:40} And having cast off the anchors, they left them in the sea, meanwhile untying the rudder ropes. And they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.
{27:41} But coming upon a place where two seas met, they grounded the ship, and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was broken by the pounding of the surf.
{27:42} And the soldiers intended to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape.
{27:43} But the captain, intending to save Sha’ul, kept them from their intention, and commanded those able to swim to jump first and get to land,
{27:44} and the rest, some indeed on boards, and some on items of the ship. And so it came to be that all reached the land in safety.
{28:1} And having come to safety, they then learned that the island was called Melite.
{28:2} And the foreigners showed us extraordinary kindness, for they kindled a fire and received us all, because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold.
{28:3} But Sha’ul, having gathered a bundle of sticks, and having laid them on the fire, an adder came out because of the heat, and fastened itself on his hand.
{28:4} And when the foreigners saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to each other, “This man is certainly a murderer, whom, though saved from the sea, still right-ruling does not allow to live.”
{28:5} Then, indeed, he shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no evil.
{28:6} And expecting that he would swell up or suddenly fall down dead, they waited for a long time and saw no harm come to him, changing their minds they said that he was a mighty one.
{28:7} And in the neighbourhood of that place there were lands of the chief of the island, whose name was Poplius, who received us and housed us in a friendly way for three days.
{28:8} And it came to be that the father of Poplius lay sick with inflammation and dysentery. Sha’ul went in to him, and having prayed he laid his hands on him and healed him.
{28:9} And when this took place, the rest of those on the island who had diseases also came and were healed,
{28:10} who also respected us in many ways. And when we were setting sail, they provided us with our needs.
{28:11} And after three months we set sail in an Alexandrian ship which had wintered at the island, and whose figurehead was “Dioscuri.”
{28:12} And having landed at Syracuse, we stayed three days,
{28:13} from which place we went round and arrived at Rhegium. And after one day the south wind blew, and the second day we came to Puteoli,
{28:14} where we found brothers, and were invited to stay with them seven days. And so we went toward Rome.
{28:15} And when the brothers there heard about us, they came to meet us as far as Forum of Appius and Three Taverns. When Sha’ul saw them, he thanked Elohim and took courage.
{28:16} And when we came to Rome, the captain delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Sha’ul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier guarding him.
{28:17} And it came to be after three days that Sha’ul called the leaders of the Yehuḏim together. And when they had come together, he said to them, “Men, brothers, though I have done none at all against our people or the practices of our fathers, I was delivered as a prisoner from Yerushalayim into the hands of the Romans,
{28:18} who, when they had examined me, intended to let me go, because there was no cause for putting me to death.
{28:19} “But the Yehuḏim spoke against it, and I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I had any accusation against my nation.
{28:20} “This therefore is the reason I called for you, to see you and speak with you. It is because of the expectation of Yisra’ĕl that I am bound with this chain.”
{28:21} And they said to him, “We neither received letters from Yehuḏah concerning you, nor have any of the brothers who came reported or spoken whatever wicked about you.
{28:22} And we think it right to hear from you what you think, for indeed, concerning this sect, we know that it is spoken against everywhere.
{28:23} And having appointed him a day, many came to him where he was staying, to whom he was explaining, earnestly witnessing about the reign of Elohim, and persuading them concerning יהושע from both the Torah of Mosheh and the Prophets, from morning until evening.
{28:24} And some indeed were persuaded by what was said, but some believed not.
{28:25} And disagreeing with one another, they began to leave, after Sha’ul had spoken one word, “The Set-apart Spirit rightly spoke through Yeshayahu the prophet to our fathers,
{28:26} saying, ‘Go to this people and say, “Hearing you shall hear but by no means understand, and seeing you shall see but by no means perceive,
{28:27} for the heart of this people has become thickened, and with their ears they heard heavily, and they have closed their eyes, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn back, and I should heal them.”’
{28:28} Therefore let it be known to you that the deliverance of Elohim has been sent to the nations, and they shall hear!
{28:29} And when he had said these words, the Yehuḏim went away and had a great dispute among themselves.
{28:30} And Sha’ul stayed two entire years in his own rented house, and was receiving all who came to him,
{28:31} proclaiming the reign of Elohim and teaching about the Master יהושע Messiah with all boldness, unhindered.
