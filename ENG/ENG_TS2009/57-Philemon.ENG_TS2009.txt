{1:1} Sha’ul, a prisoner of Messiah יהושע, and Timotiyos the brother, to Pileymon our beloved one and fellow worker,
{1:2} and Apphia our sister, and Archippos our fellow soldier, and the assembly at your house:
{1:3} Favour to you and peace from Elohim our Father and the Master יהושע Messiah.
{1:4} I always thank my Elohim when I mention you in my prayers,
{1:5} hearing of your love and the belief which you have toward the Master יהושע and toward all the set-apart ones,
{1:6} so that the sharing of your belief might become working in the knowledge of all the good which is in you toward Messiah יהושע.
{1:7} For we have much joy and encouragement in your love, because the tender affections of the set-apart ones have been refreshed by you, brother.
{1:8} Therefore, although I have much boldness in Messiah to command you what is fitting,
{1:9} because of love, I rather appeal – being such a one as Sha’ul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of יהושע Messiah –
{1:10} I appeal to you for my child Onesimos, whom I brought forth while in my chains,
{1:11} who formerly was of no use to you, but now is of good use to you and to me,
{1:12} whom I sent back to you, and receive him, that is, my own tender affections,
{1:13} whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.
{1:14} But without your opinion I wished to do none at all, so that your good deed should not be by way of necessity, but voluntary.
{1:15} For he parted from you for a while, possibly because of this, so that you might have him back forever,
{1:16} no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Master.
{1:17} So, if you regard me as your partner, receive him as you would me.
{1:18} But if he has wronged you or owes you whatever, put that on my account.
{1:19} I, Sha’ul, wrote with my own hand. I shall repay – not to mention to you that you indeed owe yourself to me also.
{1:20} Yes, brother, let me derive pleasure from you in the Master, refresh my tender affections in the Master.
{1:21} Trusting in your obedience, I wrote to you, knowing that you shall do even more than I say.
{1:22} And at the same time also prepare a place for me to stay, for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to you.
{1:23} Epaphras, fellow prisoner of me in Messiah יהושע, greets you,
{1:24} and Marqos, Aristarchos, Demas, Luqas, my fellow workers.
{1:25} The favour of our Master יהושע Messiah be with your spirit. Amĕn.
