{1:1} And יהוה called to Mosheh, and spoke to him from the Tent of Appointment, saying,
{1:2} “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘When anyone of you brings an offering to יהוה, you bring your offering of the livestock, of the herd or of the flock.
{1:3} ‘If his offering is an ascending offering of the herd, let him bring a male, a perfect one. Let him bring it at the door of the Tent of Appointment, for his acceptance before יהוה.
{1:4} ‘And he shall lay his hand on the head of the ascending offering, and it shall be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him.
{1:5} ‘And he shall slay the bull before יהוה. And the sons of Aharon, the priests, shall bring the blood and sprinkle the blood all around on the slaughter-place which is at the door of the Tent of Appointment.
{1:6} ‘And he shall skin the ascending offering and cut it into its pieces.
{1:7} ‘And the sons of Aharon the priest shall put fire on the slaughter-place, and lay the wood in order on the fire.
{1:8} ‘And the sons of Aharon, the priests, shall arrange the pieces, with the head and the fat on the wood which is on the fire on the slaughter-place.
{1:9} ‘But its entrails and its legs he washes with water. And the priest shall burn all of it on the slaughter-place as an ascending offering, an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.
{1:10} ‘And if his offering is from the flock, from the sheep or from the goats as an ascending offering, let him bring a male, a perfect one.
{1:11} ‘And he shall slay it on the north side of the slaughter-place before יהוה. And the sons of Aharon, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood on the slaughter-place all around.
{1:12} ‘And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat, and the priest shall arrange them on the wood which is on the fire on the slaughter-place.
{1:13} ‘But the entrails and the legs he washes with water. And the priest shall bring it all and burn it on the slaughter-place. It is an ascending offering, an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.
{1:14} ‘And if the ascending offering of his offering to יהוה is of birds, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves or young pigeons.
{1:15} ‘And the priest shall bring it to the slaughter-place, and shall wring off its head, and burn it on the slaughter-place, and its blood shall be drained out at the side of the slaughter-place.
{1:16} ‘And he shall remove its crop with its feathers and throw it beside the slaughter-place on the east side, into the place for ashes.
{1:17} ‘And he shall split it at its wings, but not sever it. And the priest shall burn it on the slaughter-place, on the wood that is on the fire. It is an ascending offering, an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.
{2:1} ‘And when anyone brings a grain offering to יהוה, his offering is to be of fine flour. And he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense on it,
{2:2} and he shall bring it to the sons of Aharon, the priests, and he shall take from it his hand filled with fine flour and oil with all the frankincense. And the priest shall burn it as a remembrance portion on the slaughter-place, an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.
{2:3} ‘And the rest of the grain offering is for Aharon and his sons, most set-apart of the offerings to יהוה by fire.
{2:4} ‘And when you bring as an offering a grain offering baked in the oven, it is of unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened thin cakes anointed with oil.
{2:5} ‘But if your offering is a grain offering on the griddle, it is of fine flour, unleavened, mixed with oil.
{2:6} ‘Divide it into bits and pour oil on it, it is a grain offering.
{2:7} ‘And if your offering is a grain offering, in a stewing-pot, it is made of fine flour with oil.
{2:8} ‘And you shall bring to יהוה the grain offering that is made of these, and shall present it to the priest, and he shall bring it to the slaughter-place.
{2:9} ‘And the priest shall take from the grain offering a remembrance portion, and burn it on the slaughter-place, an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.
{2:10} ‘And the rest of the grain offering is for Aharon and his sons, most set-apart of the offerings to יהוה made by fire.
{2:11} ‘No grain offering which you bring to יהוה is made with leaven, for you do not burn any leaven or any honey in an offering to יהוה made by fire.
{2:12} ‘Bring them to יהוה as an offering of the first-fruits, but they are not burned on the slaughter-place for a sweet fragrance.
{2:13} ‘And season with salt every offering of your grain offering, and do not allow the salt of the covenant of your Elohim to be lacking from your grain offering. With all your offerings you bring salt.
{2:14} ‘And if you bring a grain offering of your first-fruits to יהוה, bring for the grain offering of your first-fruits green heads of grain roasted on the fire, crushed heads of new grain.
{2:15} ‘And you shall put oil on it, and lay frankincense on it. It is a grain offering.
{2:16} ‘And the priest shall burn the remembrance portion, from its crushed grain and from its oil, with all the frankincense, an offering made by fire to יהוה.
{3:1} ‘And if that which he presents is a slaughtering of peace offerings, if he is bringing it of the herd, whether male or female, he brings a perfect one before יהוה.
{3:2} ‘And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and slay it at the door of the Tent of Appointment. And the sons of Aharon, the priests, shall sprinkle the blood on the slaughter-place all around.
{3:3} ‘And from the slaughtering of peace offerings he shall bring a fire offering to יהוה, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,
{3:4} and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them by the loins, and the appendage on the liver which he removes with the kidneys.
{3:5} ‘And the sons of Aharon shall burn it on the slaughter-place upon the ascending offering, which is on the wood, which is on the fire, as an offering made by fire, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.
{3:6} ‘And if that which he presents is from the flock, for a slaughtering of peace offerings to יהוה, male or female, he brings a perfect one.
{3:7} ‘If he is bringing a lamb as his offering, then he shall bring it before יהוה,
{3:8} and shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and slay it in front of the Tent of Appointment, and the sons of Aharon shall sprinkle its blood on the slaughter-place round about.
{3:9} ‘And from the slaughtering of peace offerings he shall bring near – as a fire offering to יהוה – its fat, all the fat tail which he removes close to the backbone, and the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,
{3:10} and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the loins, and the appendage on the liver, which he removes with the kidneys.
{3:11} ‘And the priest shall burn them on the slaughter-place as food, an offering made by fire to יהוה.
{3:12} ‘And if his offering is a goat, then he shall bring it before יהוה,
{3:13} and shall lay his hand on its head and slay it before the Tent of Appointment. And the sons of Aharon shall sprinkle its blood on the slaughter-place all around.
{3:14} ‘And from it he shall bring his offering, as an offering made by fire to יהוה, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,
{3:15} and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the loins, and the appendage on the liver, which he removes with the kidneys.
{3:16} ‘And the priest shall burn them on the slaughter-place as food, an offering made by fire for a sweet fragrance. All the fat belongs to יהוה.
{3:17} ‘An everlasting law throughout your generations in all your dwellings: you do not eat any fat or any blood.’”
{4:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{4:2} “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘When a being sins by mistake against any of the commands of יהוה, which are not to be done, and shall do any of them:
{4:3} ‘If the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, then he shall bring to יהוה for his sin which he has sinned a young bull, a perfect one, as a sin offering,
{4:4} and he shall bring the bull to the door of the Tent of Appointment before יהוה, and shall lay his hand on the bull’s head, and slay the bull before יהוה.
{4:5} ‘And the anointed priest shall take some of the bull’s blood and bring it to the Tent of Appointment,
{4:6} and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before יהוה, in front of the veil of the set-apart place.
{4:7} ‘And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the slaughter-place of sweet incense before יהוה, which is in the Tent of Appointment, and pour all the blood of the bull at the base of the slaughter-place of the ascending offering, which is at the door of the Tent of Appointment.
{4:8} ‘Then he takes all the fat of the bull as the sin offering, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat which is on the entrails,
{4:9} and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the loins, and the appendage on the liver, which he removes with the kidneys,
{4:10} “as it was taken from the bull of the slaughtering of peace offerings. And the priest shall burn them on the slaughter-place of the ascending offering.
{4:11} ‘But the skin of the bull, and all its flesh, with its head and legs, its entrails and dung –
{4:12} all of the bull – he shall bring outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire. Where the ashes are poured out it is burned.
{4:13} ‘And if the entire congregation of Yisra’ĕl strays by mistake, and the matter has been hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done against any of the commands of יהוה, which are not to be done, and shall be guilty,
{4:14} when the sin which they have sinned becomes known, then the assembly shall bring a young bull for the sin, and bring it before the Tent of Appointment.
{4:15} ‘And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before יהוה, and the bull shall be slain before יהוה.
{4:16} ‘And the anointed priest shall bring some of the bull’s blood to the Tent of Appointment,
{4:17} and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before יהוה, in front of the veil,
{4:18} and put some of the blood on the horns of the slaughter-place which is before יהוה, which is in the Tent of Appointment, and pour all the blood at the base of the slaughter-place of ascending offering, which is at the door of the Tent of Appointment.
{4:19} ‘Then he takes all the fat from it and shall burn it on the slaughter-place.
{4:20} ‘And he shall do with the bull as he did with the bull as a sin offering – so shall he do it. And the priest shall make atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.
{4:21} ‘And he shall bring the bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bull. It is a sin offering for the assembly.
{4:22} ‘When a ruler sins, and by mistake has done against any of the commands of יהוה his Elohim which are not to be done, and shall be guilty,
{4:23} or if his sin which he has sinned is made known to him, then he shall bring as his offering a buck of the goats, a male, a perfect one.
{4:24} ‘And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and slay it at the place where they slay the ascending offering before יהוה. It is a sin offering.
{4:25} ‘And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and shall put it on the horns of the slaughter-place of ascending offering, and pour its blood at the base of the slaughter-place of ascending offering,
{4:26} and burn all its fat on the slaughter-place, like the fat of the slaughtering of the peace offerings. And the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.
{4:27} ‘And if any being of the people of the land sins by mistake by doing against any of the commands of יהוה which are not to be done, and shall be guilty,
{4:28} or if his sin which he has sinned shall be made known to him, then he shall bring as his offering a female goat, a perfect one, for his sin which he has sinned.
{4:29} ‘And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering at the place of the ascending offering.
{4:30} ‘And the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, and shall put it on the horns of the slaughter-place of ascending offering, and pour all the blood at the base of the slaughter-place,
{4:31} then remove all its fat, as fat is removed from the slaughtering of the peace offerings. And the priest shall burn it on the slaughter-place for a sweet fragrance to יהוה. And the priest shall make atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.
{4:32} ‘And if he brings a lamb as his sin offering, he brings a female, a perfect one.
{4:33} ‘And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and slay it as a sin offering at the place where they slay the ascending offering.
{4:34} ‘And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and shall put it on the horns of the slaughter-place of ascending offering, and pour all the blood at the base of the slaughter-place.
{4:35} ‘Then he removes all its fat, as the fat of the lamb is removed from the slaughtering of the peace offerings. And the priest shall burn it on the slaughter-place, according to the fire offerings to יהוה. So the priest shall make atonement for his sin that he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
{5:1} ‘And when a being sins in that he has heard the voice of swearing, and is a witness, or has seen, or has known, but does not reveal it, he shall bear his crookedness.
{5:2} ‘Or when a being touches any unclean matter, or the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean livestock, or the carcass of unclean creeping creatures, and it has been hidden from him, he is unclean and guilty.
{5:3} ‘Or when he touches uncleanness of man, any of his uncleanness by which he is unclean, and it has been hidden from him, when he shall know it, then he shall be guilty.
{5:4} ‘Or when a being swears, speaking rashly with his lips to do evil or to do good, whatever it is that a man swears rashly with an oath, and it has been hidden from him, when he shall know it, then he shall be guilty of one of these.
{5:5} ‘And it shall be, when he is guilty of one of these, that he shall confess that in which he has sinned,
{5:6} and shall bring his guilt offering to יהוה for his sin which he has sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a female goat as a sin offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him, for his sin.
{5:7} ‘And if he is unable to bring a lamb, then he shall bring to יהוה, he who has sinned, two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for an ascending offering.
{5:8} ‘And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall bring near that which is for the sin offering first, and nib off its head from its neck, but not sever it.
{5:9} ‘And he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the slaughter-place, and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the slaughter-place. It is a sin offering.
{5:10} ‘And he shall prepare the second as an ascending offering according to the right-ruling, and the priest shall make atonement for him, for his sin which he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
{5:11} ‘But if he is unable to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he who sinned shall bring for his offering one-tenth of an ĕphah of fine flour as a sin offering. He puts no oil on it, nor does he put any frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering.
{5:12} ‘And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his hand filled with it as a remembrance portion, and burn it on the slaughter-place according to the offerings made by fire to יהוה. It is a sin offering.
{5:13} ‘And the priest shall make atonement for him, for his sin that he has sinned in any of these, and it shall be forgiven him. And it shall be the priest’s, like a grain offering.’”
{5:14} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{5:15} “When a being commits a trespass, and has sinned by mistake against the set-apart matters of יהוה, then he shall bring to יהוה as his guilt offering a ram, a perfect one, from the flock, with your valuation in sheqels of silver according to the sheqel of the set-apart place, as a guilt offering.
{5:16} “And he shall make good for the sin that he has done against that which is set-apart, and shall add one-fifth to it and give it to the priest. And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and it shall be forgiven him.
{5:17} And when any being sins, and has done what is not to be done, against any of the commands of יהוה, though he knew it not, yet he shall be guilty and shall bear his crookedness.
{5:18} “Then he shall bring to the priest a ram, a perfect one, from the flock, with your valuation, as a guilt offering. And the priest shall make atonement for his mistake he committed unintentionally, though he did not know it, and it shall be forgiven him –
{5:19} it is a guilt offering, he was truly guilty before יהוה.”
{6:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{6:2} When any being sins, and committed a trespass against יהוה, and has lied to his neighbour about a deposit, or about a pledge, or about a robbery, or shall extort from his neighbour,”
{6:3} or has found what was lost and has lied concerning it, or did swear falsely, so that he sins in regard to any one of all these that a man does,
{6:4} then it shall be, when he sins, and shall be guilty, that he shall return what he took by robbery, or what he has extorted, or the deposit which was deposited with him, or the lost item which he found,
{6:5} or all that about which he swore falsely. He shall repay its total value, add one-fifth more to it, and give it to whom it belongs, on the day of his guilt offering.
{6:6} “Then he brings his guilt offering to יהוה, a ram, a perfect one, from the flock, with your valuation, as a guilt offering, to the priest.
{6:7} And the priest shall make atonement for him before יהוה, and he shall be forgiven for whatever he did that made him guilty.””
{6:8} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{6:9} “Command Aharon and his sons, saying, ‘This is the Torah of the ascending offering: This is the ascending offering, because it is burned on the slaughter-place all night until morning, and the fire of the slaughter-place is kept burning on it.
{6:10} ‘And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and put his linen trousers on his body, and shall take up the ashes of the ascending offering which the fire has consumed on the slaughter-place, and shall put them beside the slaughter-place.
{6:11} ‘And he shall take off his garments, and put on other garments, and shall bring the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
{6:12} ‘And the fire on the slaughter-place is kept burning on it, it is not put out. And the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and arrange the ascending offering on it, and shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings –
{6:13} fire is continually kept burning on the slaughter-place, it is not put out.
{6:14} ‘And this is the Torah of the grain offering: The sons of Aharon shall bring it near before יהוה, in front of the slaughter-place,
{6:15} and shall take from it with his hand from the fine flour of the grain offering, and from its oil, and all the frankincense which is on the grain offering, and shall burn it on the slaughter-place for a sweet fragrance, as its remembrance portion to יהוה.
{6:16} ‘Then Aharon and his sons eat the rest of it. It is eaten with unleavened bread, in the set-apart place. They eat it in the courtyard of the Tent of Appointment.
{6:17} ‘It is not baked with leaven. I have given it to them as their portion of My offerings made by fire, it is most set-apart, like the sin offering and the guilt offering.
{6:18} ‘All the males among the children of Aharon eat it – a law forever in your generations concerning the offerings made by fire to יהוה. All that touches them is to be set-apart.’”
{6:19} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{6:20} “This is the offering of Aharon and his sons, which they bring near to יהוה, beginning on the day when he is anointed: one-tenth of an ĕphah of fine flour as a continual grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening.
{6:21} “It is made on a griddle with oil. Bring it in mixed, bring the baked portions of the grain offering near, a sweet fragrance to יהוה.
{6:22} And the anointed priest from among his sons, who is in his place, prepares it – a law forever to יהוה. All of it has to be burned,”
{6:23} and every grain offering for the priest is completely burned, it is not eaten.”
{6:24} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{6:25} “Speak to Aharon and to his sons, saying, ‘This is the Torah of the sin offering: In the place where the ascending offering is slain, the sin offering is slain before יהוה, it is most set-apart.
{6:26} ‘The priest who is making atonement eats it, in the set-apart place it is eaten, in the courtyard of the Tent of Appointment.
{6:27} ‘All that touches its flesh is to be set-apart. And when its blood is sprinkled on any garment, you wash that on which it was sprinkled, in a set-apart place.
{6:28} ‘But the earthen vessel in which it is cooked is to be broken. And if it is cooked in a bronze pot, then it is scoured and rinsed in water.
{6:29} ‘Every male among the priests eats it, it is most set-apart.
{6:30} ‘And no sin offering from which any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Appointment, to make atonement in the set-apart place, is eaten, it is burned with fire.
{7:1} ‘And this is the Torah of the guilt offering – it is most set-apart.
{7:2} ‘The guilt offering is slain in the place where they slay the ascending offering, and its blood is sprinkled on the slaughter-place all around.
{7:3} ‘Then he brings from it all its fat: the fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails,
{7:4} and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the loins, and the appendage on the liver, which he removes with the kidneys.
{7:5} ‘And the priest shall burn them on the slaughter-place as an offering made by fire to יהוה. It is a guilt offering.
{7:6} ‘Every male among the priests eats it. It is eaten in the set-apart place, it is most set-apart.
{7:7} ‘The guilt offering is like the sin offering, there is one Torah for them both: the priest who makes atonement with it, it is his.
{7:8} ‘And the priest who brings anyone’s ascending offering, the skin of the ascending offering which he has brought is the priest’s, it is his.
{7:9} ‘And every grain offering that is baked in the oven and all that is prepared in the stewing-pot, or on a griddle, is the priest’s who brings it, it is his.
{7:10} ‘And every grain offering mixed with oil, or dry, is for all the sons of Aharon, for all alike.
{7:11} ‘And this is the Torah of the slaughtering of peace offerings which is brought to יהוה.”
{7:12} ‘If he brings it for a thanksgiving, then he shall bring with the slaughtering of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened thin cakes anointed with oil, or cakes of finely blended flour mixed with oil.
{7:13} ‘Besides the cakes, he brings as his offering leavened bread together with the slaughtering of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.
{7:14} ‘And from it he shall bring one cake from each offering as a contribution to יהוה: to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings, it is his.
{7:15} ‘As for the flesh of the slaughtering of his peace offerings for thanksgiving, it is eaten the same day it is offered, he does not leave any of it until morning.
{7:16} ‘And if the slaughtering he brings is a vow or a voluntary offering, it is eaten the same day that he brings his slaughtering, and what is left of it is eaten the next day,
{7:17} but whatever is left of the flesh of the slaughtering on the third day is burned with fire.
{7:18} ‘However, if any of the flesh of the slaughtering of his peace offerings is eaten at all on the third day, it is not accepted. It is not reckoned to him who brings it, it is unclean to him, and the being who eats of it bears his crookedness.
{7:19} ‘And the flesh that touches that which is unclean is not eaten, it is burned with fire. And as for the clean flesh, all who are clean eat of it.
{7:20} ‘But the being who eats the flesh of the slaughtering of peace offerings that belongs to יהוה, while he is unclean, that being shall be cut off from his people.
{7:21} ‘And when a being who touches that which is unclean, of the uncleanness of man, or of the uncleanness of beast, or of any unclean abomination, and shall eat the flesh of the slaughtering of peace offerings that belongs to יהוה, that being shall be cut off from his people.’”
{7:22} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{7:23} “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘Do not eat any fat, of bull or sheep or goat.
{7:24} ‘And the fat of a dead body, and the fat of what is torn, is used for any purpose, but you do not eat it at all.
{7:25} ‘For whoever eats the fat of the beast of which men bring as an offering made by fire to יהוה, even the being who eats it shall be cut off from his people.
{7:26} ‘And do not eat any blood in any of your dwellings, of bird or of beast.
{7:27} ‘Any being who eats any blood, even that being shall be cut off from his people.’”
{7:28} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{7:29} “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘He who brings his slaughtering of peace offerings to יהוה brings his offering to יהוה from the slaughtering of his peace offerings.
{7:30} ‘With his own hands he brings the offerings made by fire to יהוה. He brings the fat with the breast, to be waved as a wave offering before יהוה.
{7:31} ‘And the priest shall burn the fat on the slaughter-place, but the breast shall be Aharon’s and his sons.’
{7:32} ‘And the right thigh you give to the priest as a contribution from the slaughtering of your peace offerings.
{7:33} ‘He among the sons of Aharon, who brings the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, the right thigh is his for a portion.
{7:34} ‘For the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution I have taken from the children of Yisra’ĕl, from the slaughterings of their peace offerings, and I give them to Aharon the priest and to his sons, as a law forever, from the children of Yisra’ĕl.’”
{7:35} This is the anointed portion for Aharon and the anointed portion for his sons, from the offerings made by fire to יהוה, on the day when Mosheh presented them to serve as priests to יהוה,
{7:36} which יהוה commanded to be given to them by the children of Yisra’ĕl, on the day that He anointed them, a law forever throughout their generations.
{7:37} This is the Torah of the ascending offering, of the grain offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the ordinations, and of the slaughtering of peace offerings,
{7:38} which יהוה commanded Mosheh on Mount Sinai, on the day when He commanded the children of Yisra’ĕl to bring their offerings to יהוה, in the Wilderness of Sinai.
{8:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{8:2} “Take Aharon and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread,
{8:3} and assemble all the congregation at the door of the Tent of Appointment.”
{8:4} And Mosheh did as יהוה commanded him, and the congregation was assembled at the door of the Tent of Appointment.
{8:5} And Mosheh said to the congregation, This is the word יהוה commanded to be done.””
{8:6} So Mosheh brought Aharon and his sons and washed them with water,
{8:7} and put the long shirt on him, and girded him with the girdle, and dressed him in the robe, and put the shoulder garment on him, and girded him with the embroidered band of the shoulder garment, and with it tied the shoulder garment on him,
{8:8} and put the breastplate on him, and put the Urim and the Tummim in the breastplate,
{8:9} and put the turban on his head. And on the turban, on its front, he put the golden plate, the set-apart sign of dedication, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
{8:10} And Mosheh took the anointing oil and anointed the Dwelling Place and all that was in it, and set them apart.
{8:11} And he sprinkled some of it on the slaughter-place seven times, and anointed the slaughter-place and all its utensils, and the basin and its base, to set them apart.
{8:12} And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aharon’s head and anointed him, to set him apart.
{8:13} And Mosheh brought the sons of Aharon and put long shirts on them, and girded them with girdles, and put turbans on them, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
{8:14} And he brought the bull for the sin offering, and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull for the sin offering,
{8:15} and it was slain. And Mosheh took the blood, and put some on the horns of the slaughter-place all around with his finger, and cleansed the slaughter-place. And he poured the blood at the base of the slaughter-place, and set it apart, to make atonement for it.
{8:16} And he took all the fat that was on the entrails, and the appendage on the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and Mosheh burned them on the slaughter-place.
{8:17} And the bull, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
{8:18} And he brought the ram of the ascending offering, and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram,
{8:19} and it was slain. And Mosheh sprinkled the blood on the slaughter-place all around,
{8:20} and he cut the ram into pieces. And Mosheh burned the head, and the pieces, and the fat,
{8:21} and he washed the entrails and the legs in water. And Mosheh burned the entire ram on the slaughter-place. It was an ascending offering for a sweet fragrance, and an offering made by fire to יהוה, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
{8:22} And he brought the second ram, the ram of ordination, and Aharon and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram,
{8:23} and it was slain. And Mosheh took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aharon’s right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
{8:24} And he brought near the sons of Aharon, and Mosheh put some of the blood on the tips of their right ears, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. And Mosheh sprinkled the blood on the slaughter-place all around,
{8:25} and took the fat and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the entrails, and the appendage on the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh,
{8:26} and from the basket of unleavened bread that was before יהוה he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of bread anointed with oil, and one thin cake, and put them on the fat and on the right thigh,
{8:27} and placed all these in the hands of Aharon and in the hands of his sons, and waved them as a wave offering before יהוה.
{8:28} Mosheh then took them from their hands and burned them on the slaughter-place, on the ascending offering. They were ordinations for a sweet fragrance. It was an offering by fire to יהוה.
{8:29} And Mosheh took the breast and waved it, a wave offering before יהוה. It was Mosheh’s portion of the ram of ordination, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
{8:30} And Mosheh took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the slaughter-place, and sprinkled it on Aharon, on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him. And he set apart Aharon, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
{8:31} And Mosheh said to Aharon and his sons, “Cook the flesh at the door of the Tent of Appointment, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of the ordinations, as I have commanded, saying, ‘Aharon and his sons are to eat it.’
{8:32} “Then burn the rest of the flesh and the bread with fire.
{8:33} “And do not go outside the door of the Tent of Appointment for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed – for he fills your hands for seven days.
{8:34} “יהוה has commanded to do, as he has done this day, to make atonement for you.
{8:35} And stay at the door of the Tent of Appointment day and night for seven days. And you shall guard the duty of יהוה, and not die, for so I have been commanded.””
{8:36} And Aharon and his sons did all the words that יהוה had commanded by the hand of Mosheh.
{9:1} And on the eighth day it came to be that Mosheh called Aharon and his sons and the elders of Yisra’ĕl.
{9:2} And he said to Aharon, “Take for yourself a young bull as a sin offering and a ram as an ascending offering, a perfect one, and bring them before יהוה.
{9:3} “And speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘Take a male goat as a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, perfect ones, as an ascending offering,
{9:4} and a bull and a ram as peace offerings, to slaughter before יהוה, and a grain offering mixed with oil. For today יהוה shall appear to you.’”
{9:5} And they took what Mosheh commanded before the Tent of Appointment, and all the congregation drew near and stood before יהוה.
{9:6} And Mosheh said, This is the word which יהוה commanded you to do, so that the esteem of יהוה appears to you.””
{9:7} And Mosheh said to Aharon, “Go to the slaughter-place, and prepare your sin offering and your ascending offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people. And make the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as יהוה has commanded.”
{9:8} So Aharon came near to the slaughter-place and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
{9:9} And the sons of Aharon brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the slaughter-place, and poured the blood at the base of the slaughter-place.
{9:10} And the fat, and the kidneys, and the appendage on the liver of the sin offering he burned on the slaughter-place, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
{9:11} And the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.
{9:12} And he slew the ascending offering, and the sons of Aharon presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled on the slaughter-place all around.
{9:13} And they presented the ascending offering to him, with its pieces and head, and he burned them on the slaughter-place.
{9:14} And he washed the entrails and the legs, and burned them with the ascending offering on the slaughter-place.
{9:15} And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it and made it a sin offering, like the first one.
{9:16} And he brought the ascending offering and made it, according to the right-ruling.
{9:17} He also brought the grain offering, and filled his hand with it, and burned it on the slaughter-place, besides the ascending offering of the morning.
{9:18} And he slew the bull and the ram as a slaughtering of peace offerings, which were for the people. And Aharon’s sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled on the slaughter-place all around,
{9:19} and the fat from the bull and the ram, the fat tail, and the covering, and the kidneys, and the appendage on the liver,
{9:20} and they placed the fat on the breasts, and he burned the fat on the slaughter-place.
{9:21} But the breasts and the right thigh Aharon waved as a wave offering before יהוה, as Mosheh had commanded.
{9:22} Aharon then lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them, and came down from making the sin offering, and the ascending offering, and the peace offerings.
{9:23} And Mosheh and Aharon went into the Tent of Appointment, and came out and blessed the people. And the esteem of יהוה appeared to all the people,
{9:24} and fire came out from before יהוה and consumed the ascending offering and the fat on the slaughter-place. And all the people saw and cried aloud and fell on their faces.
{10:1} And Naḏaḇ and Aḇihu, the sons of Aharon, each took his fire holder and put fire in it, and put incense on it, and brought strange fire before יהוה, which He had not commanded them.
{10:2} And fire came out from יהוה and consumed them, and they died before יהוה.
{10:3} Then Mosheh said to Aharon, “This is what יהוה spoke, saying, ‘By those who come near Me let Me be set-apart! And before all the people let Me be esteemed!’” And Aharon was silent.
{10:4} And Mosheh called to Misha’ĕl and to Eltsaphan, the sons of Uzzi’ĕl the uncle of Aharon, and said to them, “Come near, take your brothers from before the set-apart place out of the camp.”
{10:5} So they came near and took them by their long shirts out of the camp, as Mosheh had said.
{10:6} And Mosheh said to Aharon, and to El‛azar and to Ithamar, his sons, “Do not unbind your heads nor tear your garments, lest you die, and wrath come upon all the people. But let your brothers, all the house of Yisra’ĕl, bewail the burning which יהוה has kindled.
{10:7} “And do not go out from the door of the Tent of Appointment, lest you die, for the anointing oil of יהוה is upon you.” And they did according to the word of Mosheh.
{10:8} And יהוה spoke to Aharon, saying,
{10:9} Do not drink wine or strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the Tent of Appointment, lest you die – a law forever throughout your generations,”
{10:10} so as to make a distinction between the set-apart and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean,
{10:11} and to teach the children of Yisra’ĕl all the laws which יהוה has spoken to them by the hand of Mosheh.”
{10:12} And Mosheh spoke to Aharon, and to El‛azar and Ithamar, his sons who were left, “Take the grain offering that is left over from the offerings made by fire to יהוה, and eat it without leaven beside the slaughter-place, for it is most set-apart.
{10:13} “And you shall eat it in a set-apart place, because it is yours by law and your sons’ by law, of the offerings made by fire to יהוה, for so I have been commanded.
{10:14} “And the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution you eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you. For they are yours by law and your sons’ by law, which are given from the slaughterings of peace offerings of the children of Yisra’ĕl.
{10:15} “The thigh of the contribution and the breast of the wave offering they bring with the offerings of fat made by fire, to bring as a wave offering before יהוה. And it shall be yours and your sons’ with you, by a law forever, as יהוה has commanded.”
{10:16} And Mosheh diligently looked for the goat of the sin offering and saw it was burned up. And he was wroth with El‛azar and Ithamar, the sons of Aharon who were left, saying,
{10:17} Why have you not eaten the sin offering in a set-apart place, since it is most set-apart, and Elohim has given it to you to bear the crookedness of the congregation, to make atonement for them before יהוה?”
{10:18} “See, its blood was not brought inside the set-apart place. You should have eaten it without fail in a set-apart place, as I have commanded.”
{10:19} And Aharon said to Mosheh, See, today they have brought their sin offering and their ascending offering before יהוה, and matters like these have come to me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been right in the eyes of יהוה?””
{10:20} And when Mosheh heard that, it was good in his eyes.
{11:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying to them,
{11:2} “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘These are the living creatures which you do eat among all the beasts that are on the earth:
{11:3} ‘Whatever has a split hoof completely divided, chewing the cud, among the beasts, that you do eat.
{11:4} ‘Only, these you do not eat among those that chew the cud or those that have a split hoof: the camel, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof, it is unclean to you;
{11:5} and the rabbit, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof, it is unclean to you;
{11:6} and the hare, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof, it is unclean to you;
{11:7} and the pig, though it has a split hoof, completely divided, yet does not chew the cud, it is unclean to you.
{11:8} ‘Their flesh you do not eat, and their carcasses you do not touch. They are unclean to you.
{11:9} ‘These you do eat of all that are in the waters: any one that has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas or in the rivers, that you do eat.
{11:10} ‘But all that have not fins and scales in the seas and in the rivers, all that move in the waters or any living being which is in the waters, they are an abomination to you.
{11:11} ‘They are an abomination to you – of their flesh you do not eat, and their carcasses you abominate.
{11:12} ‘All that have not fins or scales in the waters are an abomination to you.
{11:13} ‘And these you do abominate among the birds, they are not eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the vulture, and the black vulture,
{11:14} and the hawk, and the falcon after its kind,
{11:15} every raven after its kind,
{11:16} and the ostrich, and the nighthawk, and the seagull, and the hawk after its kind,
{11:17} and the little owl, and the fisher owl, and the great owl,
{11:18} and the white owl, and the pelican, and the carrion vulture,
{11:19} and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
{11:20} ‘All flying insects that creep on all fours is an abomination to you.
{11:21} ‘Only, these you do eat of every flying insect that creeps on all fours: those which have jointed legs above their feet with which to leap on the earth.
{11:22} ‘These of them you do eat: the arbeh- locust after its kind, and the solam- locust after its kind, and the ḥargol- locust after its kind, and the ḥagaḇ- locust after its kind.
{11:23} ‘But all other flying insects which have four feet are an abomination to you.
{11:24} ‘And by these you are made unclean, anyone touching the carcass of any of them is unclean until evening,
{11:25} and anyone picking up part of the carcass of any of them has to wash his garments, and shall be unclean until evening.
{11:26} ‘Every beast that has a split hoof not completely divided, or does not chew the cud, is unclean to you. Anyone who touches their carcass is unclean.
{11:27} ‘And whatever goes on its paws, among all the creatures that go on all fours, those are unclean to you. Anyone who touches their carcass is unclean until evening,
{11:28} and he who picks up their carcass has to wash his garments, and shall be unclean until evening. They are unclean to you.
{11:29} ‘And these are unclean to you among the creeping creatures that creep on the earth: the mole, and the mouse, and the tortoise after its kind,
{11:30} and the gecko, and the land crocodile, and the sand reptile, and the sand lizard, and the chameleon.
{11:31} ‘These are unclean to you among all that creep. Anyone who touches them when they are dead becomes unclean until evening.
{11:32} ‘And whatever any of them in its dead state falls upon, becomes unclean, whether it is any wooden object or garment or skin or sack, any object in which work is done, it is put in water. And it shall be unclean until evening, then it shall be clean.
{11:33} ‘Any earthen vessel into which any of them falls, whatever is in it becomes unclean, and you break it.
{11:34} ‘Any of the food which might be eaten, on which water comes, becomes unclean, and any drink which might be drunk from it becomes unclean.
{11:35} ‘And on whatever any of their carcass falls becomes unclean – an oven or cooking range – it is broken down. They are unclean, and are unclean to you.
{11:36} ‘But a fountain or a well, a collection of water, is clean, but whatever touches their carcass is unclean.
{11:37} ‘And when any of their carcass falls on any planting seed which is to be sown, it is clean.
{11:38} ‘But when any water is put on the seed and any part of any such carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you.
{11:39} ‘And when any of the beasts which are yours for food dies, he who touches its carcass becomes unclean until evening.
{11:40} ‘And he who eats of its carcass has to wash his garments, and shall be unclean until evening. And he who picks up its carcass has to wash his garments, and shall be unclean until evening.
{11:41} ‘And every swarming creature – the one that swarms on the earth is an abomination, it is not eaten.
{11:42} ‘Whatever crawls on its stomach, and whatever goes on all fours, and whatever has many feet among all swarming creatures – the ones swarming on the earth, these you do not eat, for they are an abomination.
{11:43} ‘Do not make yourselves abominable with any swarming creature – the one swarming, and do not make yourselves unclean with them, lest you be defiled by them.
{11:44} ‘For I am יהוה your Elohim, and you shall set yourselves apart. And you shall be set-apart, for I am set-apart. And do not defile yourselves with any swarming creature – the one creeping on the earth.
{11:45} ‘For I am יהוה who is bringing you up out of the land of Mitsrayim, to be your Elohim. And you shall be set-apart, for I am set-apart.
{11:46} ‘This is the Torah of the beasts and the birds and every living being – the creeping creature in the waters, and of every being that swarms on the earth,
{11:47} to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living creature that is eaten and the living creature that is not eaten.’”
{12:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{12:2} “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘When a woman has conceived, and has given birth to a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days, as in the days of her monthly separation she is unclean.
{12:3} ‘And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin is circumcised.
{12:4} ‘And she remains in the blood of her cleansing thirty-three days. She does not touch whatever is set-apart, and she does not come into the set-apart place until the days of her cleansing are completed.
{12:5} ‘But if she gives birth to a female child, then she shall be unclean for two weeks, as in her monthly separation, and she remains in the blood of her cleansing for sixty-six days.
{12:6} ‘And when the days of her cleansing are completed, for a son or for a daughter, she brings to the priest a lamb a year old, as an ascending offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove as a sin offering, to the door of the Tent of Appointment.
{12:7} ‘And he shall bring it before יהוה, and make atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed from the flow of her blood. This is the Torah for her who has given birth to a male or a female.
{12:8} ‘And if she is not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one as an ascending offering and the other as a sin offering. And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.’”
{13:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying,
{13:2} “When a man has on the skin of his body a swelling, a scab, or a bright spot, and it shall become on the skin of his body like a leprous infection, then he shall be brought to Aharon the priest or to one of his sons the priests.
{13:3} “And the priest shall look at the infection on the skin of the body. And if the hair on the infection has turned white, and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a leprous infection. And the priest shall look at him, and pronounce him unclean.
{13:4} “But if the bright spot is white on the skin of his body, and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and its hair has not turned white, then the priest shall shut up the infected one seven days.
{13:5} “And the priest shall look at him on the seventh day and see, if the infection appears to be as it was, and the infection has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall shut him up another seven days.
{13:6} “And the priest shall look at him again on the seventh day and see, if the infection has darkened, and the infection has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. It is a scab, and he shall wash his garments and be clean.
{13:7} “But if the scab spreads further over the skin, after he has been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen by the priest again.
{13:8} “And the priest shall look and see, if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean, it is leprosy.
{13:9} “When the infection of leprosy is on a man, then he shall be brought to the priest.
{13:10} And the priest shall look and see, if the swelling on the skin is white, and it has turned the hair white, and there is a spot of raw flesh in the swelling,”
{13:11} it is an old leprosy on the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. He does not shut him up, for he is unclean.
{13:12} “And if leprosy breaks out all over the skin, and the leprosy shall cover all the skin of the infected one, from his head to his foot, wherever the priest looks,
{13:13} then the priest shall look and see, if the leprosy has covered all his body, he shall pronounce the infected one clean. It has all turned white, he is clean.
{13:14} “But the day raw flesh appears on him, he is unclean.
{13:15} “And the priest shall look at the raw flesh and pronounce him to be unclean – the raw flesh is unclean, it is leprosy.
{13:16} “Or when the raw flesh changes and turns white again, he shall come to the priest.
{13:17} “And the priest shall look at him and see, if the infection has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce the infected one clean, he is clean.
{13:18} And when the body has a boil in the skin, and it is healed,”
{13:19} and in the place of the boil there comes a white swelling or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it shall be seen by the priest.
{13:20} “And the priest shall look and see, if it appears deeper than the skin, and its hair has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean, it is a leprous infection which has broken out of the boil.
{13:21} But if the priest looks at it and sees no white hairs in it, and it is not deeper than the skin, but has faded, then the priest shall shut him up seven days;”
{13:22} and if it has spread further over the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean, it is a leprous infection.
{13:23} “But if the bright spot stays in its place, it has not spread, it is the scar of the boil, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
{13:24} Or when the body receives a burn on its skin by fire, and the raw flesh of the burn shall become a bright spot, reddish-white or white,”
{13:25} then the priest shall look at it and see, if the hair of the bright spot has turned white, and it appears deeper than the skin, it is leprosy broken out in the burn. And the priest shall pronounce him unclean, it is a leprous infection.
{13:26} “But if the priest looks at it and sees there are no white hairs in the bright spot, and it is not deeper than the skin, but has faded, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.
{13:27} “And the priest shall look at him on the seventh day. If it spreads further over the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean, it is a leprous infection.
{13:28} “But if the bright spot stays in its place, and has not spread on the skin, but has faded, it is a swelling from the burn. And the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the scar from the burn.
{13:29} And when a man, or a woman, has an infection on the head or in the beard,”
{13:30} then the priest shall look at the infection and see, if it appears deeper than the skin, and there is thin yellow hair in it, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean, it is an eruption, a leprosy of the head or beard.
{13:31} But when the priest looks at the infection of the eruption and sees that it does not appear deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up the one with the infection of the eruption seven days.
{13:32} “And on the seventh day the priest shall look at the infection and see, if the eruption has not spread, and there is no yellow hair in it, and the eruption does not appear deeper than the skin,
{13:33} “then he shall shave himself, but the eruption he does not shave. And the priest shall shut up the one with the eruption another seven days.
{13:34} “And on the seventh day the priest shall look at the eruption and see, if the eruption has not spread over the skin, and does not appear deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. And he shall wash his garments, and he shall be clean.
{13:35} But if the eruption spreads further over the skin after his cleansing,”
{13:36} then the priest shall look at him and see, if the eruption has spread over the skin, the priest need not seek for yellow hair, he is unclean.
{13:37} “But if the eruption appears to have stayed, and there is black hair grown up in it, the eruption has healed. He is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
{13:38} And when a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the body, white bright spots,”
{13:39} then the priest shall look and see, if the bright spots on the skin of the body are dull white, it is a white spot that grows on the skin, he is clean.
{13:40} “And when a man loses the hair of his head, he is bald, he is clean.
{13:41} “And if the hair has fallen from his forehead, he is bald on the forehead, he is clean.
{13:42} “And when there is on the bald head or bald forehead a reddish-white infection, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead.
{13:43} And the priest shall look at it and see, if the swelling of the infection is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy on the skin of the body,”
{13:44} he is a leprous man, he is unclean. The priest shall pronounce him unclean, without fail, his infection is on his head.
{13:45} “As for the leper who has the infection, his garments are torn, and his head is uncovered, and he has to cover his upper lip and cry, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’
{13:46} “He is unclean – all the days he has the infection he is unclean. He is unclean, and he dwells alone, his dwelling place is outside the camp.
{13:47} “And when a garment has an infection of leprosy in it, in a woollen garment or in a linen garment,
{13:48} or in the warp or in the weft of linen or wool, or in leather or in any leather-work,
{13:49} and the infection shall be greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather, or in the warp or in the weft, or in any leather object, it is an infection of leprosy and shall be shown to the priest.
{13:50} “And the priest shall look at the infection and shut up the infected seven days.
{13:51} “And he shall look at the infection on the seventh day. And when the infection has spread in the garment, or in the warp or in the weft, or in the leather or any leather-work, the infection is an active leprosy, it is unclean.
{13:52} “And he shall burn that garment, or the warp or the weft, in wool or in linen, or any leather object in which the infection is, for it is an active leprosy. It is burned with fire.
{13:53} “But if the priest looks and sees that the infection has not spread in the garment, or in the warp or in the weft, or in any leather object,
{13:54} then the priest shall give command, and they shall wash that in which the infection is. And he shall shut it up another seven days.
{13:55} “And the priest shall look at the infection after it has been washed and see, if the infection has not changed its appearance, though the infection has not spread, it is unclean, and burn it in the fire – it is eaten away, in its inside or outside.
{13:56} “And if the priest shall look and see that the infection has faded after washing it, then he shall tear it out of the garment, or out of the warp, or out of the weft, or out of the leather.
{13:57} “And if it is still seen in the garment, or in the warp or in the weft, or in any leather object, it is a spreading infection. Burn it with fire, that in which the infection is.
{13:58} “And if you wash the garment, or the warp or the weft, or any leather object, if the infection has disappeared from it, then it shall be washed a second time, and shall be clean.
{13:59} This is the Torah of the infection of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen, or in the warp or in the weft, or in any leather object, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean.””
{14:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{14:2} “This shall be the Torah of the leper for the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest,
{14:3} and the priest shall go out of the camp, and the priest shall look and see, if the leprosy is healed in the leper,
{14:4} then the priest shall command, and he shall take for him who is to be cleansed two live and clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.
{14:5} “And the priest shall command, and he shall slay one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.
{14:6} “Let him take the live bird and the cedar wood and the scarlet and the hyssop, and dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was slain over the running water.
{14:7} “And he shall sprinkle it seven times on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the live bird loose in the open field.
{14:8} “And he who is to be cleansed shall wash his garments, and shall shave off all his hair and wash himself in water, and shall be clean. Then after that he comes into the camp, but shall stay outside his tent seven days.
{14:9} “And on the seventh day it shall be that he shaves all the hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shaves off. And he shall wash his garments and wash his body in water, and shall be clean.
{14:10} And on the eighth day he takes two male lambs, perfect ones, and one ewe lamb a year old, a perfect one, and three-tenths of an ĕphah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and one log of oil.
{14:11} And the priest who is cleansing shall present the man who is to be cleansed, with these offerings, before יהוה, at the door of the Tent of Appointment.
{14:12} “And the priest shall take one male lamb and bring it as a guilt offering, and the log of oil, and wave them as a wave offering before יהוה.
{14:13} “And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he slays the sin offering and the ascending offering, in a set-apart place. For the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest. It is most set-apart.
{14:14} “And the priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
{14:15} “And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand.
{14:16} “And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times before יהוה.
{14:17} “And of the rest of the oil in his hand, the priest puts some on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the blood of the guilt offering.
{14:18} “And the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he puts on the head of him who is to be cleansed. And the priest shall make atonement for him before יהוה.
{14:19} “And the priest shall make the sin offering, and make atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness. Then afterwards he slays the ascending offering.
{14:20} “And the priest shall offer the ascending offering and the grain offering on the slaughter-place. And the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
{14:21} But if he is poor and is unable to afford it, then he shall take one male lamb as a guilt offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one-tenth of an ĕphah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and a log of oil,”
{14:22} and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, such as he is able to afford, and one shall be a sin offering and the other an ascending offering.
{14:23} “And he shall bring them to the priest on the eighth day for his cleansing, to the door of the Tent of Appointment, before יהוה.
{14:24} “And the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before יהוה.
{14:25} “And he shall slay the lamb of the guilt offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
{14:26} “Then the priest pours some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand.
{14:27} “And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before יהוה.
{14:28} “And the priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of the right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the guilt offering.
{14:29} “And the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he puts on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before יהוה.
{14:30} And he shall prepare one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, such as he is able to afford,”
{14:31} that which he is able to afford, the one as a sin offering and the other as an ascending offering, with the grain offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him who is to be cleansed before יהוה.
{14:32} “This is the Torah for one who had an infection of leprosy, who is unable to afford for his cleansing.”
{14:33} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying,
{14:34} When you come into the land of Kena‛an, which I am giving you as a possession, and I put a plague of leprosy in a house in the land of your possession,”
{14:35} then shall the one who owns the house come and inform the priest, saying, ‘It seems to me that there is some plague in the house.’
{14:36} “And the priest shall command, and they shall empty the house, before the priest goes in to look at the plague, so that all that is in the house is not made unclean. And after that the priest goes in to look at the house.
{14:37} And he shall look at the plague and see, if the plague is on the walls of the house with sunken places, greenish or reddish, which appear to be deep in the wall,”
{14:38} then the priest shall go out of the house, to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.
{14:39} “And the priest shall come again on the seventh day and look and see, if the plague has spread on the walls of the house,
{14:40} then the priest shall command, and they shall remove the stones with the plague in them, and they shall throw them outside the city, into an unclean place,
{14:41} while he lets the house be scraped inside, all around, and the dust that they scrape off they shall pour out in an unclean place outside the city.
{14:42} “And they shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones, and take other mortar and plaster the house.
{14:43} “And if the plague comes back and breaks out in the house, after he has removed the stones, after he has scraped the house, and after it is plastered,
{14:44} then the priest shall come and look and see, if the plague has spread in the house, it is an active leprosy in the house, it is unclean.
{14:45} “And he shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber, and all the plaster of the house, and he shall bring them outside the city to an unclean place.
{14:46} “And he who goes into the house, all the days while it is shut up, becomes unclean until evening.
{14:47} “And he who lies down in the house has to wash his garments, and he who eats in the house has to wash his garments.
{14:48} “However, if the priest indeed comes in and looks at it and sees that the plague has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
{14:49} “And to cleanse the house, he shall take two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.
{14:50} “And he shall slay one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water,
{14:51} and he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the live bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird and in the running water, and shall sprinkle the house seven times.
{14:52} He shall thus cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and the running water and the live bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet,”
{14:53} and he shall let the live bird loose outside the city in the open field, and shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.
{14:54} “This is the Torah for any infection of leprosy, and eruption,
{14:55} and for leprosy of a garment, and of a house,
{14:56} and for a swelling, and for a scab, and for a bright spot,
{14:57} to teach when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the Torah of leprosy.”
{15:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh and to Aharon, saying,
{15:2} “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘When any man has a discharge from his flesh, his discharge is unclean.
{15:3} ‘And this is his uncleanness in regard to his discharge; whether his flesh runs with his discharge, or his flesh is stopped up by his discharge, it is his uncleanness.
{15:4} ‘Any bed becomes unclean on which he who has the discharge lies, and any object on which he sits becomes unclean.
{15:5} ‘And anyone who touches his bed has to wash his garments, and shall bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
{15:6} ‘And he who sits on any object on which he who has the discharge sat, has to wash his garments, and shall bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
{15:7} ‘And he who touches the flesh of him who has the discharge has to wash his garments, and shall bathe in water, and shall be unclean until evening.
{15:8} ‘And when he who has the discharge spits on him who is clean, then he shall wash his garments, and shall bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
{15:9} ‘Any saddle on which he who has the discharge rides becomes unclean.
{15:10} ‘And whoever touches any of that which was under him is unclean until evening. And he who is carrying them up has to wash his garments, and shall bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
{15:11} ‘And anyone whom he who has the discharge touches without rinsing his hands in water, shall wash his garments and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
{15:12} ‘And the earthen vessel which he who has the discharge touches has to be broken, and every wooden vessel has to be rinsed in water.
{15:13} ‘And when he who has a discharge is cleansed of his discharge, then he shall count for himself seven days for his cleansing, and shall wash his garments, and shall bathe his flesh in running water, and be clean.
{15:14} ‘And on the eighth day he takes for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and shall come before יהוה, to the door of the Tent of Appointment, and shall give them to the priest.
{15:15} ‘And the priest shall prepare them, the one as a sin offering and the other as an ascending offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him before יהוה because of his discharge.
{15:16} ‘And when a man has an emission of semen, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until evening.
{15:17} ‘And any garment and any leather on which there is semen, shall also be washed with water, and be unclean until evening.
{15:18} ‘And when a woman lies with a man, and there is an emission of semen, they both shall bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
{15:19} ‘And when a woman has a discharge, and the discharge from her flesh is blood, she has to be in her separation for seven days. And whoever touches her is unclean until evening.
{15:20} ‘And whatever she lies on during her separation is unclean. And whatever she sits on is unclean.
{15:21} ‘And anyone who touches her bed has to wash his garments, and shall bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
{15:22} ‘And whoever touches any object that she sat on has to wash his garments, and shall bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
{15:23} ‘And if it is on the bed or on any object on which she sits, when he touches it, he is unclean until evening.
{15:24} ‘And if a man lies with her at all, and her monthly flow is on him, he shall be unclean seven days. And any bed he lies on is unclean.
{15:25} ‘And when a woman has a discharge of blood for many days, other than at the time of her monthly separation, or when she discharges beyond her usual time of monthly separation, all the days of her unclean discharge shall be as the days of her monthly separation. She is unclean.
{15:26} ‘Any bed on which she lies all the days of her discharge is to her as the bed of her monthly separation. And whatever she sits on is unclean, as the uncleanness of her monthly separation.
{15:27} ‘And anyone who touches them is unclean, and shall wash his garments, and shall bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
{15:28} ‘But if she is cleansed of her discharge, then she shall count for herself seven days, and after that she is clean.
{15:29} ‘And on the eighth day she takes for herself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and shall bring them to the priest, to the door of the Tent of Appointment.
{15:30} ‘And the priest shall prepare the one as a sin offering and the other as an ascending offering, and the priest shall make atonement for her before יהוה for the discharge of her uncleanness.
{15:31} ‘Thus you shall separate the children of Yisra’ĕl from their uncleanness, lest they die in their uncleanness when they defile My Dwelling Place which is in their midst.
{15:32} ‘This is the Torah for one who has a discharge, and for him who emits semen and is unclean thereby,
{15:33} and for her who is sick in her monthly separation, and for one who has a discharge, either man or woman, and for him who lies with an unclean woman.’”
{16:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh after the death of the two sons of Aharon, as they drew near before יהוה, and died.
{16:2} And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Speak to Aharon your brother not to come in at all times to the Set-apart Place inside the veil, before the lid of atonement which is on the ark, lest he die, because I appear in the cloud above the lid of atonement.
{16:3} “With this Aharon should come into the Set-apart Place: with the blood of a young bull as a sin offering, and of a ram as an ascending offering.
{16:4} “He should put on the set-apart linen long shirt, with linen trousers on his flesh, and gird himself with a linen girdle, and be dressed with the linen turban – they are set-apart garments. And he shall bathe his body in water, and shall put them on.
{16:5} “And from the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl he takes two male goats as a sin offering, and one ram as an ascending offering.
{16:6} “And Aharon shall bring the bull as a sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house.
{16:7} “And he shall take the two goats and let them stand before יהוה at the door of the Tent of Appointment.
{16:8} “And Aharon shall cast lots for the two goats, one lot for יהוה and the other lot for Azazel.
{16:9} “And Aharon shall bring the goat on which the lot for יהוה fell, and shall prepare it as a sin offering.
{16:10} But the goat on which the lot for Azazel fell is caused to stand alive before יהוה, to make atonement upon it, to send it into the wilderness to Azazel.”
{16:11} “And Aharon shall bring the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house, and shall slay the bull as the sin offering which is for himself,
{16:12} and shall take a fire holder filled with burning coals of fire from the slaughter-place before יהוה, with his hands filled with sweet incense beaten fine, and shall bring it inside the veil.
{16:13} “And he shall put the incense on the fire before יהוה, and the cloud of incense shall cover the lid of atonement which is on the Witness, lest he die.
{16:14} “And he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the lid of atonement on the east side, also in front of the lid of atonement he sprinkles some of the blood with his finger seven times.
{16:15} “And he shall slay the goat of the sin offering, which is for the people, and shall bring its blood inside the veil, and shall do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the lid of atonement and in front of the lid of atonement.
{16:16} “And he shall make atonement for the Set-apart Place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and because of their transgressions in all their sins. And so he does for the Tent of Appointment which is dwelling with them in the midst of their uncleanness.
{16:17} “And no man should be in the Tent of Appointment when he goes in to make atonement in the Set-apart Place, until he comes out. And he shall make atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Yisra’ĕl.
{16:18} “And he shall go out to the slaughter-place that is before יהוה, and make atonement for it. And he shall take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the slaughter-place all around.
{16:19} “And he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and set it apart from the uncleanness of the children of Yisra’ĕl.
{16:20} “And when he has finished atoning for the Set-apart Place, and the Tent of Appointment, and the slaughter-place, he shall bring the live goat.
{16:21} “Then Aharon shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and shall confess over it all the crookednesses of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and all their transgressions in all their sins, and shall put them on the head of the goat, and shall send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a fit man.
{16:22} “And the goat shall bear on itself all their crookednesses, to a land cut off. Thus he shall send the goat away into the wilderness.
{16:23} “Aharon shall then come into the Tent of Appointment, and shall take off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the Set-apart Place, and shall leave them there.
{16:24} “And he shall bathe his body in water in the set-apart place, and shall put on his garments, and shall come out and prepare his ascending offering and the ascending offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people,
{16:25} and burn the fat of the sin offering on the slaughter-place.
{16:26} “And he who sent away the goat to Azazel washes his garments, and shall bathe his body in water, and afterward he comes into the camp.
{16:27} “And the bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Set-apart Place, is brought outside the camp. And they shall burn their skins, and their flesh, and their dung with fire.
{16:28} “And he who burns them washes his garments, and shall bathe his body in water, and afterward he comes into the camp.
{16:29} And this shall be for you a law forever: In the seventh new moon, on the tenth day of the new moon, you afflict your beings, and do no work, the native or the stranger who sojourns among you.
{16:30} “For on that day he makes atonement for you, to cleanse you, to be clean from all your sins before יהוה.
{16:31} “It is a Sabbath of rest for you, and you shall afflict your beings – a law forever.
{16:32} “And the priest, who is anointed and ordained to serve as priest in his father’s place, shall make atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, the set-apart garments,
{16:33} and he shall make atonement for the Most Set-apart Place, and make atonement for the Tent of Appointment and for the slaughter-place, and make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
{16:34} “And this shall be for you a law forever, to make atonement for the children of Yisra’ĕl, for all their sins, once a year.” And he did as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
{17:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{17:2} “Speak to Aharon, to his sons, and to all the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘This is the word which יהוה has commanded, saying,
{17:3} Any man from the house of Yisra’ĕl who slays a bull or a lamb or a goat in the camp, or who slays it outside the camp,”
{17:4} and does not bring it to the door of the Tent of Appointment, to bring an offering to יהוה before the Dwelling Place of יהוה, blood-guilt is reckoned to that man. He has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people,
{17:5} in order that the children of Yisra’ĕl bring their slaughterings which they slaughter in the open field. And they shall bring them to יהוה at the door of the Tent of Appointment, to the priest, and slaughter them as slaughterings of peace offerings to יהוה.
{17:6} “And the priest shall sprinkle the blood on the slaughter-place of יהוה at the door of the Tent of Appointment, and shall burn the fat for a sweet fragrance to יהוה.
{17:7} And let them no longer slaughter their slaughterings to demons, after whom they whored. This is a law forever for them throughout their generations.”’”
{17:8} “And say to them, ‘Any man of the house of Yisra’ĕl, or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who offers an ascending offering or slaughtering,
{17:9} and does not bring it to the door of the Tent of Appointment, to do it to יהוה, that man shall be cut off from among his people.
{17:10} ‘And any man of the house of Yisra’ĕl, or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who eats any blood, I shall set My face against that being who eats blood, and shall cut him off from among his people.
{17:11} ‘For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the slaughter-place to make atonement for your lives, for it is the blood that makes atonement for the life.’
{17:12} Therefore I said to the children of Yisra’ĕl, ‘No being among you eats blood, nor does any stranger who sojourns among you eat blood.’”
{17:13} “And any man from the children of Yisra’ĕl, or from the strangers who sojourn among you, who hunts and catches any beast or bird, which is eaten, shall pour out its blood and cover it with dust,
{17:14} for it is the life of all flesh. Its blood is for its life. And I said to the children of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Do not eat the blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood. Anyone eating it is cut off.’
{17:15} “And any being who eats a carcass or what was torn by a beast, be he a native or a stranger, he shall wash his garments and bathe in water, and shall be unclean until evening. Then he shall be clean.
{17:16} “And if he does not wash or bathe his body, then he shall bear his crookedness.”
{18:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{18:2} “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘I am יהוה your Elohim.
{18:3} ‘Do not do as they do in the land of Mitsrayim, where you dwelt. And do not do as they do in the land of Kena‛an, where I am bringing you, and do not walk in their laws.
{18:4} ‘Do My right-rulings and guard My laws, to walk in them. I am יהוה your Elohim.
{18:5} ‘And you shall guard My laws and My right-rulings, which a man does and lives by them. I am יהוה.
{18:6} ‘No one is to approach anyone of his own flesh to uncover his nakedness. I am יהוה.
{18:7} ‘The nakedness of your father or the nakedness of your mother you do not uncover. She is your mother, you do not uncover her nakedness.
{18:8} ‘The nakedness of your father’s wife you do not uncover, it is your father’s nakedness.
{18:9} ‘The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother, whether born at home or elsewhere, their nakedness you do not uncover.
{18:10} ‘The nakedness of your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter, their nakedness you do not uncover, for theirs is your own nakedness.
{18:11} ‘The nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter, brought forth by your father, she is your sister, you do not uncover her nakedness.
{18:12} ‘The nakedness of your father’s sister you do not uncover, she is your father’s flesh.
{18:13} ‘The nakedness of your mother’s sister you do not uncover, for she is your mother’s flesh.
{18:14} ‘The nakedness of your father’s brother you do not uncover, you do not approach his wife, she is your aunt.
{18:15} ‘The nakedness of your daughter-in-law you do not uncover, she is your son’s wife, you do not uncover her nakedness.
{18:16} ‘The nakedness of your brother’s wife you do not uncover, it is your brother’s nakedness.
{18:17} ‘The nakedness of a woman and her daughter you do not uncover, nor do you take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness. They are her relatives – it is wickedness.
{18:18} ‘And do not take a woman as a rival to her sister, to uncover her nakedness while the other is alive.
{18:19} ‘And do not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness in her monthly separation of uncleanness.
{18:20} ‘And do not have intercourse with the wife of your neighbour, to defile yourself with her.
{18:21} ‘And do not give any of your offspring to pass through to Moleḵ. And do not profane the Name of your Elohim. I am יהוה.
{18:22} ‘And do not lie with a male as with a woman, it is an abomination.
{18:23} ‘And do not have intercourse with any beast, to defile yourself with it. And a woman does not stand before a beast to mate with it, it is a perversion.
{18:24} ‘Do not defile yourselves with all these, for by all these the nations are defiled, which I am driving out before you.
{18:25} ‘Thus the land became defiled, therefore I punished it for its crookedness, and the land vomited out its inhabitants.
{18:26} ‘But you, you shall guard My laws and My right-rulings, and not do any of these abominations, the native nor stranger who sojourns among you,
{18:27} because the men of the land who were before you have done all these abominations, and thus the land became defiled,
{18:28} ‘So let not the land vomit you out for defiling it, as it vomited out the nations that were before you.
{18:29} ‘For whoever does any of these abominations, those beings who do them shall be cut off from among their people.
{18:30} ‘And you shall guard My Charge, so as not to do any of these abominable laws which were done before you, so as not to defile yourselves by them. I am יהוה your Elohim.’”
{19:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{19:2} “Speak to all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘Be set-apart, for I יהוה your Elohim am set-apart.
{19:3} ‘Each one of you should fear his mother and his father, and guard My Sabbaths. I am יהוה your Elohim.
{19:4} ‘Do not turn to idols, and do not make for yourselves moulded mighty ones. I am יהוה your Elohim.
{19:5} "‘And when you slaughter a slaughtering of peace offerings to יהוה, slaughter it for your acceptance.
{19:6} ‘It is eaten the same day you slaughter it, and on the next day. And that which is left on the third day is burned with fire.
{19:7} ‘So if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable, it is not accepted,
{19:8} and he who eats it bears his crookedness, because he has profaned the set-apart offering of יהוה, and that being shall be cut off from his people.
{19:9} ‘And when you reap the harvest of your land, do not completely reap the corners of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest.
{19:10} ‘And do not glean your vineyard or gather every grape of your vineyard, leave them for the poor and the stranger. I am יהוה your Elohim.
{19:11} ‘Do not steal, do not lie, do not deceive one another.
{19:12} ‘And do not swear falsely by My Name and so profane the Name of your Elohim. I am יהוה.
{19:13} ‘Do not oppress your neighbour or rob him. The wages of him who is hired is not to remain with you all night until morning.
{19:14} ‘Do not curse the deaf or put a stumbling-block before the blind, but fear your Elohim. I am יהוה.
{19:15} ‘Do no unrighteousness in right-ruling. Do not be partial to the poor or favour the face of the great, but rightly rule your neighbour in righteousness.
{19:16} ‘Do not go slandering among your people. Do not stand against the blood of your neighbour. I am יהוה.
{19:17} ‘Do not hate your brother in your heart. Reprove your neighbour, for certain, and bear no sin because of him.
{19:18} ‘Do not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the children of your people. And you shall love your neighbour as yourself. I am יהוה.
{19:19} ‘Guard My laws. Do not let your livestock mate with another kind. Do not sow your field with mixed seed. And do not put a garment woven of two sorts of thread upon you.
{19:20} ‘And when a man has intercourse with a woman who is a female servant, engaged to a man, and to be ransomed, but she has not been ransomed nor set free, there should be an inquiry. But they are not put to death, because she was not free.
{19:21} ‘And he shall bring his guilt offering to יהוה, to the door of the Tent of Appointment, a ram as a guilt offering.
{19:22} ‘And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before יהוה for his sin which he has done. And the sin which he has sinned shall be forgiven him.
{19:23} ‘And when you come into the land, and have planted all kinds of trees for food, then you shall reckon their fruit as uncircumcised. For three years it is as uncircumcised to you, it is not eaten.

{19:33} ‘And when a stranger sojourns with you in your land, do not oppress him.
{19:34} ‘Let the stranger who dwells among you be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself. For you were strangers in the land of Mitsrayim. I am יהוה your Elohim.
{19:35} ‘Do no unrighteousness in right-ruling, in measurement of length, in weight, or in measuring liquids.
{19:36} ‘Have right scales, right weights, a right ĕphah, and a right hin. I am יהוה your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim.
{19:37} ‘And you shall guard all My laws and all My right-rulings, and do them. I am יהוה.’”
{20:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{20:2} “Say to the children of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Any man of the children of Yisra’ĕl, or of the strangers who sojourn in Yisra’ĕl, who gives any of his offspring to Moleḵ, shall certainly be put to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones.
{20:3} ‘And I, I shall set My face against that man, and shall cut him off from the midst of his people, because he has given of his offspring to Moleḵ, so as to defile My set-apart place and to profane My set-apart Name.
{20:4} ‘And if the people of the land at all hide their eyes from the man, as he gives any of his offspring to Moleḵ, and they do not kill him,
{20:5} then I shall set My face against that man and against his clan, and shall cut him off – and all who go whoring after him, even go whoring after Moleḵ – from the midst of their people.
{20:6} ‘And the being who turns to mediums, and to spiritists, to go whoring after them, I shall set My face against that being and cut him off from the midst of his people.
{20:7} ‘And you shall set yourselves apart, and shall be set-apart, for I am יהוה your Elohim,
{20:8} and you shall guard My laws and do them. I am יהוה, who sets you apart.
{20:9} ‘For everyone who curses his father or his mother shall certainly be put to death – he has cursed his father or his mother, his blood is on him.
{20:10} ‘And a man who commits adultery with the wife of another man, who commits adultery with the wife of his neighbour: the adulterer and the adulteress shall certainly be put to death.
{20:11} ‘And a man who lies with the wife of his father has uncovered the nakedness of his father, both of them shall certainly be put to death, their blood is upon them.
{20:12} ‘And a man who lies with his daughter-in-law: both of them shall certainly be put to death, they have made confusion, their blood is upon them.
{20:13} ‘And a man who lies with a male as he lies with a woman: both of them have done an abomination, they shall certainly be put to death, their blood is upon them.
{20:14} ‘And a man who marries a woman and her mother: it is wickedness, they are burned with fire, both he and they, that there be no wickedness in your midst.
{20:15} ‘And a man who has intercourse with a beast: he shall certainly be put to death, and the beast you kill.
{20:16} ‘And a woman who approaches any beast and mates with it: you shall kill the woman and the beast, they shall certainly be put to death, their blood is upon them.
{20:17} ‘And a man who takes his sister, his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter, and sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness: is it loving-commitment? And they shall be cut off before the eyes of their people. He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness, he bears his crookedness.
{20:18} ‘And a man who lies with a woman during her sickness and uncovers her nakedness: he has laid bare her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood, both of them shall be cut off from the midst of their people.
{20:19} ‘And do not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister nor of your father’s sister, for that is laying bare one’s own flesh, they bear their crookedness.
{20:20} ‘And a man who lies with his uncle’s wife: he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness, they bear their sin, they die childless.
{20:21} ‘And a man who takes his brother’s wife: it is uncleanness, he has uncovered his brother’s nakedness, they are childless.
{20:22} ‘And you shall guard all My laws and all My right-rulings, and do them, so that the land where I am bringing you to dwell does not vomit you out.
{20:23} ‘And do not walk in the laws of the nation which I am driving out before you, for they do all these, and therefore I loathed them.
{20:24} ‘But I say to you, You are going to possess their land, and I Myself give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey.” I am יהוה your Elohim, who has separated you from the peoples.
{20:25} ‘And you shall make a distinction between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean birds and clean. And do not make yourselves abominable by beast or by bird, or whatever creeps on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.
{20:26} ‘And you shall be set-apart to Me, for I יהוה am set-apart, and have separated you from the peoples to be Mine.
{20:27} ‘And a man or a woman in whom there is a medium, or who are spiritists, shall certainly be put to death, they are to stone them with stones. Their blood is upon them.’”
{21:1} And יהוה said to Mosheh, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aharon, and say to them: ‘No one is to be defiled for the dead among his people,
{21:2} except for his relatives who are nearest to him: for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother;
{21:3} and for his maiden sister who is near to him, who has had no husband – for her he is defiled.
{21:4} ‘A leader does not defile himself among his people, to profane himself;
{21:5} they do not make any bald place on their heads, and they do not shave the corner of their beard, and they do not make a cutting in their flesh.
{21:6} ‘They are set-apart to their Elohim and do not profane the Name of their Elohim, for they bring the fire offerings of יהוה, and the bread of their Elohim, and shall be set-apart.
{21:7} ‘They do not take a woman who is a whore or a defiled woman, and they do not take a woman put away from her husband, for he is set-apart to his Elohim.
{21:8} ‘And you shall set him apart, for he brings the bread of your Elohim, he is set-apart to you. For I, יהוה, setting you apart, am set-apart.
{21:9} ‘And when the daughter of any priest profanes herself by whoring, she profanes her father. She is burned with fire.
{21:10} ‘And the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil was poured and who is ordained to wear the garments, does not unbind his head nor tear his garments,
{21:11} nor come near any dead body, nor defile himself for his father or his mother,
{21:12} nor go out of the set-apart place, nor profane the set-apart place of his Elohim, for the sign of dedication of the anointing oil of his Elohim is upon him. I am יהוה.
{21:13} ‘And let him take a wife in her maidenhood.
{21:14} ‘A widow or one put away or a defiled woman or a whore – these he does not take. But a maiden of his own people he does take as a wife.
{21:15} ‘And he does not profane his offspring among his people, for I am יהוה, who sets him apart.’”
{21:16} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{21:17} “Speak to Aharon, saying, ‘No man of your offspring throughout their generations, who has any defect, is to draw near to bring the bread of his Elohim.
{21:18} ‘For any man who has a defect is not to draw near: a man blind or one lame or disfigured or deformed,
{21:19} a man who has a broken foot or broken hand,
{21:20} or is a hunchback or a dwarf, or a man who has a defect in his eye, or eczema or scab, or is a eunuch.
{21:21} ‘No man among the offspring of Aharon the priest, who has a defect, is to come near to bring the offerings made by fire to יהוה – he has a defect, he does not come near to bring the bread of his Elohim.
{21:22} ‘He does eat the bread of his Elohim, both the most set-apart and the set-apart,
{21:23} only, he does not go near the veil or approach the slaughter-place, because he has a defect, lest he profanes My set-apart places. For I am יהוה, who sets them apart.’”
{21:24} Thus Mosheh spoke to Aharon and his sons, and to all the children of Yisra’ĕl.
{22:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{22:2} “Speak to Aharon and his sons, that they separate themselves from the set-apart offerings of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and that they do not profane My set-apart Name in what they set apart to Me. I am יהוה.
{22:3} Say to them, ‘Any man of all your offspring throughout your generations who draws near the set-apart offerings which the children of Yisra’ĕl set apart to יהוה, while he has uncleanness upon him, that being shall be cut off from before Me. I am יהוה.
{22:4} ‘Any man of the offspring of Aharon, who is a leper or has a discharge, does not eat the set-apart offerings until he is clean. And whoever touches what is rendered unclean by a being, or a man who has had an emission of semen,
{22:5} or a man who touches any swarming creature by which he would be made unclean, or any being by whom he would become unclean, even any of his uncleanness;
{22:6} the being who has touched it shall be unclean until evening, and does not eat the set-apart offerings, but shall bathe his body in water.
{22:7} ‘And when the sun goes down he shall be clean, and afterward eat the set-apart offerings, because it is his food.
{22:8} ‘He does not eat that which dies or is torn by beasts, becoming unclean by it. I am יהוה.
{22:9} ‘And they shall guard My Charge, lest they bear sin for it and die thereby, when they profane it. I יהוה set them apart.
{22:10} ‘And no stranger eats the set-apart offering. A sojourner with the priest, or a hired servant, does not eat the set-apart offering.
{22:11} ‘But when the priest buys a being with his silver, he does eat of it. And one who is born in his house does eat his food.
{22:12} ‘And when a priest’s daughter is married to a stranger, she does not eat of the set-apart offerings.
{22:13} ‘But when a priest’s daughter is a widow or put away, and has no child, and has returned to her father’s house as in her youth, she does eat her father’s food, but no stranger eats of it.
{22:14} ‘And when a man eats the set-apart offering by mistake, then he shall give a set-apart offering to the priest, and add one-fifth to it.
{22:15} ‘And let the priests not profane the set-apart offerings of the children of Yisra’ĕl, which they lift up to יהוה,
{22:16} or allow them to bear the crookedness of trespass when they eat their set-apart offerings. For I am יהוה, who sets them apart.’”
{22:17} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{22:18} “Speak to Aharon and his sons, and to all the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘Any man of the house of Yisra’ĕl, or of the strangers in Yisra’ĕl, who brings his offering for any of his vows or for any of his voluntary offerings, which they bring to יהוה as an ascending offering,
{22:19} for your acceptance, is a male, a perfect one from the cattle, from the sheep, or from the goats.
{22:20} ‘Whatever has a defect, you do not bring, for it is not acceptable for you.
{22:21} ‘And when a man brings a slaughtering of peace offerings to יהוה, to complete a vow, or a voluntary offering from the cattle or the sheep, it is to be perfect to be accepted, let there be no defect in it.
{22:22} ‘Those blind or broken or cut, or having an ulcer or eczema or scabs, you do not bring to יהוה, nor make an offering by fire of them on the slaughter-place to יהוה.
{22:23} ‘As for a bull or a lamb that has any limb deformed or dwarfed you do prepare as a voluntary offering, but for a vow it is not accepted.
{22:24} ‘Do not bring to יהוה what is bruised or crushed, or torn or cut, nor do it in your land.
{22:25} ‘And from a son of a stranger’s hand you do not bring any of these as the bread of your Elohim, for their corruption is in them, and defects are in them, they are not acceptable for you.’”
{22:26} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{22:27} “When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall be seven days with its mother. And from the eighth day and thereafter it is acceptable as an offering made by fire to יהוה.
{22:28} “But do not slay a cow or a sheep and its young on the same day.
{22:29} “And when you slaughter a slaughtering of thanksgiving to יהוה, slaughter it for your acceptance.
{22:30} “It is eaten that same day, leave none of it till morning. I am יהוה.
{22:31} “And you shall guard My commands and do them. I am יהוה.
{22:32} And do not profane My set-apart Name, and I shall be set-apart among the children of Yisra’ĕl. I am יהוה, who sets you apart,”
{22:33} who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, to be your Elohim. I am יהוה.”
{23:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{23:2} “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘The appointed times of יהוה, which you are to proclaim as set-apart gatherings, My appointed times, are these:
{23:3} ‘Six days work is done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest, a set-apart gathering. You do no work, it is a Sabbath to יהוה in all your dwellings.
{23:4} ‘These are the appointed times of יהוה, set-apart gatherings which you are to proclaim at their appointed times.
{23:5} ‘In the first new moon, on the fourteenth day of the new moon, between the evenings, is the Pĕsaḥ to יהוה.
{23:6} ‘And on the fifteenth day of this new moon is the Festival of Matzot to יהוה – seven days you eat unleavened bread.
{23:7} ‘On the first day you have a set-apart gathering, you do no servile work.
{23:8} ‘And you shall bring an offering made by fire to יהוה for seven days. On the seventh day is a set-apart gathering, you do no servile work.’”
{23:9} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{23:10} “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and you shall say to them, ‘When you come into the land which I give you, and shall reap its harvest, then you shall bring a sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest to the priest.
{23:11} ‘And he shall wave the sheaf before יהוה, for your acceptance. On the morrow after the Sabbath the priest waves it.
{23:12} ‘And on that day when you wave the sheaf, you shall prepare a male lamb a year old, a perfect one, as an ascending offering to יהוה,
{23:13} and its grain offering: two-tenths of an ĕphah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering made by fire to יהוה, a sweet fragrance, and its drink offering: one-fourth of a hin of wine.
{23:14} ‘And you do not eat bread or roasted grain or fresh grain until the same day that you have brought an offering to your Elohim – a law forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
{23:15} ‘And from the morrow after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, you shall count for yourselves: seven completed Sabbaths.
{23:16} ‘Until the morrow after the seventh Sabbath you count fifty days, then you shall bring a new grain offering to יהוה.
{23:17} ‘Bring from your dwellings for a wave offering two loaves of bread, of two-tenths of an ĕphah of fine flour they are, baked with leaven, first-fruits to יהוה.
{23:18} ‘And besides the bread, you shall bring seven lambs a year old, perfect ones, and one young bull and two rams. They are an ascending offering to יהוה, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering made by fire for a sweet fragrance to יהוה.
{23:19} ‘And you shall offer one male goat as a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old, as a slaughter of peace offerings.
{23:20} ‘And the priest shall wave them, besides the bread of the first-fruits, as a wave offering before יהוה, besides the two lambs. They are set-apart to יהוה for the priest.
{23:21} ‘And on this same day you shall proclaim a set-apart gathering for yourselves, you do no servile work on it – a law forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
{23:22} ‘And when you reap the harvest of your land do not completely reap the corners of your field when you reap, and do not gather any gleaning from your harvest. Leave them for the poor and for the stranger. I am יהוה your Elohim.’”
{23:23} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{23:24} Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘In the seventh new moon, on the first day of the new moon, you have a rest, a remembrance of Teru‛ah,
{23:25} ‘You do no servile work, and you shall bring an offering made by fire to יהוה.’”
{23:26} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{23:27} On the tenth day of this seventh new moon is Yom haKippurim. It shall be a set-apart gathering for you. And you shall afflict your beings, and shall bring an offering made by fire to יהוה.
{23:28} “And you do no work on that same day, for it is Yom Kippurim, to make atonement for you before יהוה your Elohim.
{23:29} “For any being who is not afflicted on that same day, he shall be cut off from his people.
{23:30} “And any being who does any work on that same day, that being I shall destroy from the midst of his people.
{23:31} “You do no work – a law forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
{23:32} ‘It is a Sabbath of rest to you, and you shall afflict your beings. On the ninth day of the new moon at evening, from evening to evening, you observe your Sabbath.”
{23:33} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{23:34} Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘On the fifteenth day of this seventh new moon is the Festival of Sukkot for seven days to יהוה.
{23:35} ‘On the first day is a set-apart gathering, you do no servile work.
{23:36} ‘For seven days you bring an offering made by fire to יהוה. On the eighth day there shall be a set-apart gathering for you, and you shall bring an offering made by fire to יהוה. It is a closing festival, you do no servile work.
{23:37} ‘These are the appointed times of יהוה which you proclaim as set-apart gatherings, to bring an offering made by fire to יהוה, an ascending offering and a grain offering, a slaughtering and drink offerings, as commanded for every day –
{23:38} besides the Sabbaths of יהוה, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your voluntary offerings which you give to יהוה.
{23:39} ‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh new moon, when you gather in the fruit of the land, celebrate the festival of יהוה for seven days. On the first day is a rest, and on the eighth day a rest.
{23:40} ‘And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of good trees, branches of palm trees, twigs of leafy trees, and willows of the stream, and shall rejoice before יהוה your Elohim for seven days.
{23:41} ‘And you shall celebrate it as a festival to יהוה for seven days in the year – a law forever in your generations. Celebrate it in the seventh new moon.
{23:42} ‘Dwell in booths for seven days; all who are native born in Yisra’ĕl dwell in booths,
{23:43} so that your generations know that I made the children of Yisra’ĕl dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Mitsrayim. I am יהוה your Elohim.’”
{23:44} Thus did Mosheh speak of the appointed times of יהוה to the children of Yisra’ĕl.
{24:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{24:2} “Command the children of Yisra’ĕl that they bring to you clear oil of pressed olives for the light, to make the lamps burn continually.
{24:3} “Outside the veil of the Witness, in the Tent of Appointment, Aharon is to arrange it from evening until morning before יהוה continually – a law forever throughout your generations.
{24:4} “He is to arrange the lamps on the clean gold lampstand before יהוה continually.
{24:5} “And you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it, two-tenths of an ĕphah in each cake.
{24:6} “And you shall set them in two rows, six in a row, on the clean table before יהוה.
{24:7} “And you shall put clear frankincense on each row, and it shall be on the bread as a remembrance portion, an offering made by fire to יהוה.
{24:8} “On every Sabbath he is to arrange it before יהוה continually, from the children of Yisra’ĕl – an everlasting covenant.
{24:9} And it shall be for Aharon and his sons, and they shall eat it in the set-apart place, because it is most set-apart to him from the offerings of יהוה made by fire – an everlasting law.””
{24:10} And the son of an Yisra’ĕli woman, whose father was a Mitsrian man, went out among the children of Yisra’ĕl. And the Yisra’ĕli woman’s son and a man of Yisra’ĕl strove in the camp.
{24:11} And the Yisra’ĕli woman’s son blasphemed the Name, and cursed. So they brought him to Mosheh. Now his mother’s name was Shelomith the daughter of Diḇri, of the tribe of Dan.
{24:12} And they put him under guard, that it might be declared to them at the mouth of יהוה.
{24:13} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{24:14} “Bring the one who has cursed outside the camp, and all those who heard him shall lay their hands on his head, and all the congregation shall stone him.
{24:15} “And speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘Anyone who curses his Elohim shall bear his sin.
{24:16} ‘And he who blasphemes the Name of יהוה shall certainly be put to death, and all the congregation certainly stone him, the stranger as well as the native. When he blasphemes the Name, he is put to death.
{24:17} ‘And a man who strikes the being of any man shall certainly be put to death.
{24:18} ‘And he who strikes a beast repays it, body for body.
{24:19} ‘And when a man inflicts a blemish upon his neighbour, as he has done so it is done to him:
{24:20} ‘Fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he inflicts a blemish upon him, so it is done to him.
{24:21} ‘And he who strikes a beast repays it, and he who strikes a man to death is put to death.
{24:22} ‘You are to have one right-ruling, for the stranger and for the native, for I am יהוה your Elohim.’”
{24:23} And Mosheh spoke to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and they brought the one who cursed outside the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the children of Yisra’ĕl did as יהוה commanded Mosheh.
{25:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh on Mount Sinai, saying,
{25:2} “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘When you come into the land which I give you, then the land shall observe a Sabbath to יהוה.
{25:3} ‘Six years you sow your field, and six years you prune your vineyard, and gather in its fruit,
{25:4} but in the seventh year the land is to have a Sabbath of rest, a Sabbath to יהוה. Do not sow your field and do not prune your vineyard.
{25:5} ‘Do not reap what grows of its own of your harvest, and do not gather the grapes of your unpruned vine, for it is a year of rest for the land.
{25:6} ‘And the Sabbath of the land shall be to you for food, for you and your servant, and for your female servant and your hired servant, and for the stranger who sojourns with you,
{25:7} and for your livestock and the beasts that are in your land. All its crops are for food.
{25:8} ‘And you shall count seven Sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years. And the time of the seven Sabbaths of years shall be to you forty-nine years.
{25:9} ‘You shall then sound a shophar-sound on the tenth day of the seventh new moon, on Yom haKippurim cause a shophar to sound through all your land.
{25:10} ‘And you shall set the fiftieth year apart, and proclaim release throughout all the land to all its inhabitants, it is a Yoḇel for you. And each of you shall return to his possession, and each of you return to his clan.
{25:11} ‘The fiftieth year is a Yoḇel to you. Do not sow, nor reap what grows of its own, nor gather from its unpruned vine.
{25:12} ‘It is a Yoḇel, it is set-apart to you. Eat from the field its crops.
{25:13} ‘In the Year of this Yoḇel let each one of you return to his possession.
{25:14} ‘And when you sell whatever to your neighbour or buy from the hand of your neighbour, do not exploit one another.
{25:15} ‘According to the number of years after the Yoḇel you buy from your neighbour, and according to the number of years of crops he sells to you.
{25:16} ‘According to the greater number of years you increase its price, and according to the fewer number of years you diminish its price, because he sells to you according to the number of the years of the crops.
{25:17} ‘And do not oppress one another, but you shall fear your Elohim. For I am יהוה your Elohim.
{25:18} ‘And you shall do My laws and guard My right-rulings, and shall do them. And you shall dwell in the land in safety,
{25:19} ‘and the land shall yield its fruit, and you shall eat to satisfaction, and shall dwell there in safety.
{25:20} ‘And since you might say, “What do we eat in the seventh year, since we do not sow nor gather in our crops?”
{25:21} ‘Therefore I have commanded My blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth the crop for three years.
{25:22} ‘And you shall sow in the eighth year, and eat of the old crop until the ninth year. Eat of the old until its crop comes in.
{25:23} ‘And the land is not to be sold beyond reclaim, for the land is Mine, for you are sojourners and settlers with Me.
{25:24} ‘And provide for a redemption for the land, in all the land of your possession.
{25:25} ‘When your brother becomes poor, and has sold some of his possession, and his redeemer, a close relative comes to redeem it, then he shall redeem what his brother sold.
{25:26} ‘And when the man has no one to redeem it, but he himself becomes able to redeem it,
{25:27} then let him count the years since its sale, and return the remainder to the man to whom he sold it, that he shall return to his possession.
{25:28} ‘And if his hand has not found enough to give back to him, then what was sold shall remain in the hand of him who bought it until the Year of Yoḇel. And it shall be released in the Yoḇel, and he shall return to his possession.
{25:29} ‘And when a man sells a house in a walled city, then his right of redemption shall be at the end of the year after it is sold. His right of redemption lasts a year.
{25:30} ‘But if it is not redeemed within a complete year, then the house in the walled city shall be established beyond reclaim to the buyer of it, throughout his generations. It is not released in the Yoḇel.
{25:31} ‘The houses of villages, however, which have no wall around them are reckoned as the field of the country. A right of redemption belongs to it, and they are released in the Yoḇel.
{25:32} ‘As for the cities of the Lĕwites, and the houses in the cities of their possession, the Lĕwites have a right of redemption forever.
{25:33} ‘And that which is redeemed from the Lĕwites, both the sale of a house and the city of his possession shall be released in the Year of Yoḇel, because the houses in the cities of the Lĕwites are their possession in the midst of the children of Yisra’ĕl.
{25:34} ‘But the field of the open land of their cities is not sold, for it is their everlasting possession.
{25:35} ‘And when your brother becomes poor, and his hand has failed with you, then you shall strengthen him, and he shall live with you, like a stranger or a sojourner.
{25:36} ‘Take no interest from him, or profit, but you shall fear your Elohim, and your brother shall live with you.
{25:37} ‘Do not lend him your silver on interest, and do not lend him your food for profit.
{25:38} ‘I am יהוה your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, to give you the land of Kena‛an, to be your Elohim.
{25:39} ‘And when your brother who dwells by you becomes poor, and sells himself to you, do not make him serve as a slave.
{25:40} ‘But as a hired servant, as a settler he is with you, and serves you until the Year of Yoḇel.
{25:41} ‘And then he shall leave you, he and his children with him, and shall return to his own clan, even return to the possession of his fathers.
{25:42} ‘For they are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Mitsrayim, they are not sold as slaves.
{25:43} ‘Do not rule over him with harshness, but you shall fear your Elohim.
{25:44} ‘And your male and female slaves whom you have from the nations that are around you, from them you buy male and female slaves,
{25:45} and also from the sons of the strangers sojourning among you, from them you buy, and from their clans who are with you, which they shall bring forth in your land, and they shall be your property.
{25:46} ‘And you shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them as a possession, they are your slaves for all time. But over your brothers, the children of Yisra’ĕl, you do not rule with harshness, one over another.
{25:47} ‘Now when a sojourner or a settler with you becomes rich, and your brother with him becomes poor, and sells himself to the settler or sojourner with you, or to a member of the sojourner’s clan,
{25:48} after he has been sold, there is a right of redemption to him – one of his brothers does redeem him,
{25:49} or his uncle or his uncle’s son does redeem him, or anyone who is a close relative to him in his clan does redeem him, or if he is able, then he shall redeem himself.
{25:50} ‘And he shall reckon with him who bought him: The price of his release shall be according to the number of years, from the year that he was sold to him until the Year of Yoḇel; as the days of a hired servant it is with him.
{25:51} ‘If there are yet many years, according to them he repays the price of his redemption, from the silver of his purchase.
{25:52} ‘And if few years are left until the Year of Yoḇel, then he shall reckon with him, and according to his years he repays him the price of his redemption.
{25:53} ‘He is with him as a yearly hired servant, and he does not rule with harshness over him before your eyes.
{25:54} ‘And if he is not redeemed in these years, then he shall be released in the Year of Yoḇel, he and his children with him.
{25:55} ‘Because the children of Yisra’ĕl are servants to Me, they are My servants whom I brought out of the land of Mitsrayim. I am יהוה your Elohim.
{26:1} ‘Do not make idols for yourselves, and do not set up a carved image or a pillar for yourselves, and do not place a stone image in your land, to bow down to it. For I am יהוה your Elohim.
{26:2} ‘Guard My Sabbaths and reverence My set-apart place. I am יהוה.
{26:3} ‘If you walk in My laws and guard My commands, and shall do them,
{26:4} then I shall give you rain in its season, and the land shall yield its crops, and the trees of the field yield their fruit.
{26:5} ‘And your threshing shall last till the time of the grape harvest, and the grape harvest shall last till the time of sowing. And you shall eat your bread until you have enough, and shall dwell in your land safely.
{26:6} ‘And I shall give peace in the land, and you shall lie down and no one make you afraid. And I shall clear the land of evil beasts, and not let the sword go through your land.
{26:7} ‘And you shall pursue your enemies, and they shall fall by the sword before you.
{26:8} ‘And five of you shall pursue a hundred, and a hundred of you pursue ten thousand. And your enemies shall fall by the sword before you.
{26:9} ‘And I shall turn to you and make you fruitful, and shall increase you, and shall establish My covenant with you.
{26:10} ‘And you shall eat the old supply, and clear out the old because of the new.
{26:11} ‘And I shall set My Dwelling Place in your midst, and My being shall not reject you.
{26:12} ‘And I shall walk in your midst, and shall be your Elohim, and you shall be My people.
{26:13} ‘I am יהוה your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim, from being their slaves. And I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk upright.
{26:14} ‘But if you do not obey Me, and do not do all these commands,
{26:15} and if you reject My laws, or if your being loathes My right-rulings, so that you do not do all My commands, but break My covenant,
{26:16} I also do this to you: And I shall appoint sudden alarm over you, wasting disease and inflammation, destroying the eyes, and consuming the life. And you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
{26:17} ‘And I shall set My face against you, and you shall be smitten before your enemies. And those who hate you shall rule over you, and you shall flee when no one pursues you.
{26:18} ‘And after all this, if you do not obey Me, then I shall punish you seven times more for your sins.
{26:19} ‘And I shall break the pride of your power, and shall make your heavens like iron and your earth like bronze.
{26:20} ‘And your strength shall be spent in vain and your land not yield its crops, nor the trees of the land yield their fruit.
{26:21} ‘And if you walk contrary to Me, and refuse to obey Me, I shall bring on you seven times more plagues, according to your sins,
{26:22} and send wild beasts among you, which shall bereave you of your children. And I shall cut off your livestock, and make you few in number, and your highways shall be deserted.
{26:23} ‘And if you are not instructed by Me by these, but walk contrary to Me,
{26:24} then I also shall walk contrary to you, and I Myself shall strike you seven times for your sins.
{26:25} ‘And I shall bring against you a sword executing the vengeance of My covenant, and you shall gather together in your cities, and I shall send pestilence among you, and you shall be given into the hand of the enemy.
{26:26} ‘When I have cut off your supply of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall bring back to you your bread by weight, and you shall eat and not be satisfied.
{26:27} ‘And if in spite of this, you do not obey Me, but walk contrary to Me,
{26:28} then I shall walk contrary to you in wrath. And I Myself shall punish you seven times for your sins.
{26:29} ‘And you shall eat the flesh of your sons, and eat the flesh of your daughters.
{26:30} ‘And I shall destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-pillars, and put your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols. And My being shall loathe you.
{26:31} ‘And I shall turn your cities into ruins and lay your set-apart places waste, and not smell your sweet fragrances.
{26:32} ‘And I shall lay the land waste, and your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it.
{26:33} ‘And I shall scatter you among the nations and draw out a sword after you. And your land shall be desert and your cities ruins,
{26:34} and the land enjoy its Sabbaths as long as it lies waste and you are in your enemies’ land. Then the land would rest and enjoy its Sabbaths.
{26:35} ‘As long as it lies waste it rests, for the time it did not rest on your Sabbaths when you dwelt in it.
{26:36} ‘And as for those of you who are left, I shall send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies, and the sound of a shaken leaf shall cause them to flee. And they shall flee as though retreating from a sword, and they shall fall when no one pursues.
{26:37} ‘And they shall stumble over one another, as from before a sword, when no one pursues. And you shall be unable to stand before your enemies.
{26:38} ‘And you shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up,
{26:39} and those of you who are left rot away in their crookedness in your enemies’ lands, and also in their fathers’ crookednesses rot away with them.
{26:40} ‘But if they confess their crookedness and the crookedness of their fathers, with their trespass in which they trespassed against Me, and that they also have walked contrary to Me,
{26:41} and that I also have walked contrary to them and have brought them into the land of their enemies – if their uncircumcised heart is then humbled, and they accept the punishment of their crookedness,
{26:42} then I shall remember My covenant with Ya‛aqoḇ, and also My covenant with Yitsḥaq, and also remember My covenant with Aḇraham, and remember the land.
{26:43} ‘For the land was abandoned by them, and enjoying its Sabbaths while lying waste without them, and they were paying for their crookedness, because they rejected My right-rulings and because their being loathed My laws.
{26:44} ‘And yet for all this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I shall not reject them, nor shall I loathe them so as to destroy them and break My covenant with them. For I am יהוה their Elohim.
{26:45} ‘Then I shall remember for their sake the covenant of the ancestors whom I brought out of the land of Mitsrayim before the eyes of the nations to be their Elohim. I am יהוה.’”
{26:46} These are the laws and the right-rulings and the Torot which יהוה made between Himself and the children of Yisra’ĕl on Mount Sinai by the hand of Mosheh.
{27:1} And יהוה spoke to Mosheh, saying,
{27:2} “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and say to them, ‘When a man separates a vow, by your evaluation of lives unto יהוה,
{27:3} when your evaluation is of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old, then your evaluation shall be fifty sheqels of silver, according to the sheqel of the set-apart place.
{27:4} ‘And if it is a female, then your evaluation shall be thirty sheqels;
{27:5} and if from five years old up to twenty years old, then your evaluation for a male shall be twenty sheqels, and for a female ten sheqels;
{27:6} and if from a new moon old up to five years old, then your evaluation for a male shall be five sheqels of silver, and for a female your evaluation shall be three sheqels of silver;
{27:7} and if from sixty years old and above, if it is a male, then your evaluation shall be fifteen sheqels, and for a female ten sheqels.
{27:8} ‘But if he is too poor to pay your evaluation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall set a value for him. According to the ability of him who vowed, the priest shall value him.
{27:9} ‘And if it is a beast of which they bring an offering to יהוה, all such given to יהוה is set-apart.
{27:10} ‘He is not to replace it or exchange it, good for spoilt or spoilt for good. And if he at all exchanges beast for beast, then both it and the one exchanged for it is set-apart.
{27:11} ‘And if it is any unclean beast of which they do not bring an offering to יהוה, then he shall present the beast before the priest;
{27:12} and the priest shall value it, whether it is good or spoilt. According to your evaluation, O priest, so it shall be.
{27:13} ‘But if he indeed redeems it, then he shall add one-fifth to your evaluation.
{27:14} ‘And when a man sets his house apart, to be set-apart to יהוה, then the priest shall value it, whether it is good or spoilt. As the priest values it, so it stands.
{27:15} ‘And if he who sets it apart does redeem his house, then he shall add one-fifth of the silver of your evaluation to it, and it shall be his.
{27:16} ‘And if a man sets apart to יהוה a field he owns, then your evaluation shall be according to the seed for it – a ḥomer of barley seed at fifty sheqels of silver.
{27:17} ‘If he sets his field apart from the Year of Yoḇel, according to your evaluation it stands.
{27:18} ‘But if he sets his field apart after the Yoḇel, then the priest shall reckon to him the silver due according to the years that remain till the Year of Yoḇel, and it shall be deducted from your evaluation.
{27:19} ‘And if he who sets the field apart ever wishes to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of the silver of your evaluation to it, and it shall be his.
{27:20} ‘And if he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it is no longer redeemed,
{27:21} but the field, when it is released in the Yoḇel, is set-apart to יהוה as a dedicated field, to be the possession of the priest.
{27:22} ‘And if a man sets apart to יהוה a field which he has bought, which is not the field of his possession,
{27:23} then the priest shall reckon to him the amount of your evaluation, up to the Year of Yoḇel, and he shall give your evaluation on that day, set-apart to יהוה.
{27:24} ‘In the Year of Yoḇel the field returns to him from whom he bought it, to him whose is the possession of the land.
{27:25} ‘And all your evaluations are to be according to the sheqel of the set-apart place: twenty gĕrahs to the sheqel.
{27:26} ‘However, a first-born of the beasts, which is first-born to יהוה, no man sets it apart – whether bull or sheep, it belongs to יהוה.
{27:27} ‘And if among the unclean beasts, then he shall ransom it according to your evaluation, and shall add one-fifth to it. And if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your evaluation.
{27:28} ‘However, whatever a man lays under ban for יהוה of all that he has, man and beast, or the field of his possession, is not sold or redeemed. Whatever is laid under ban is most set-apart to יהוה.
{27:29} ‘No one under the ban, under the ban among men, is ransomed, but shall certainly be put to death.
{27:30} ‘And all the tithe of the land – of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree – belongs to יהוה. It is set-apart to יהוה.
{27:31} ‘If a man indeed redeems any of his tithes, he adds one-fifth to it.
{27:32} ‘And the entire tithe of the herd and of the flock, all that passes under the rod, the tenth one is set-apart to יהוה.
{27:33} ‘He does not inquire whether it is good or spoilt, nor does he exchange it. And if he exchanges it at all, then both it and the one exchanged for it are set-apart, it is not redeemed.’”
{27:34} These are the commands which יהוה commanded Mosheh for the children of Yisra’ĕl on Mount Sinai.
