{4:39} And they went to the entrance of Geḏor, as far as the east side of the valley, to look for pasture for their flocks,
{4:40} and they found rich, good pasture, and the land was broad, undisturbed and safe, for some Ḥamites had dwelt there formerly.
{4:41} And these written by name came in the days of Ḥizqiyahu sovereign of Yehuḏah, and struck their tents, and the homes that were found there, and put them under the ban, as it is to this day, and dwelt in their place, because there was pasture for their flocks there.
{4:42} And some of them, five hundred men of the sons of Shim‛on, went to Mount Sĕ‛ir, having as their chiefs Pelatyah, and Ne‛aryah, and Rephayah, and Uzzi’ĕl, the sons of Yishi.
{4:43} And they struck the rest of the Amalĕqites who had escaped, and dwelt there to this day.
{5:1} As for the sons of Re’uḇĕn the first-born of Yisra’ĕl – he was the first-born, but because he profaned his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Yosĕph, son of Yisra’ĕl, so that the genealogy is not listed according to the birthright,
{5:2} for Yehuḏah prevailed over his brothers, and from him came a ruler, although the birthright was Yosĕph’s –
{5:3} the sons of Re’uḇĕn the first-born of Yisra’ĕl: Ḥanoḵ and Pallu, Ḥetsron and Karmi.
{5:4} The sons of Yo’ĕl: Shemayah his son, Goḡ his son, Shim‛i his son,
{5:5} Miḵah his son, Re’ayah his son, Ba‛al his son,
{5:6} and Be’ĕrah his son, whom Tiglath-Pileser sovereign of Ashshur took into exile. He was leader of the Re’uḇĕnites.
{5:7} And his brothers by their clans, when the genealogy of their generations was registered: the chief, Ye‛i’ĕl, and Zeḵaryahu,
{5:8} and Bela son of Azaz, son of Shema, son of Yo’ĕl, who dwelt in Aro‛ĕr, as far as Neḇo and Ba‛al Me‛on.
{5:9} And he dwelt eastward as far as the entrance of the wilderness from the River Euphrates, because their livestock had increased in the land of Gil‛aḏ.
{5:10} And in the days of Sha’ul they fought against the Haḡrites, who fell by their hand. And they dwelt in their tents over all the eastern part of Gil‛aḏ.
{5:11} And the children of Gaḏ dwelt next to them in the land of Bashan as far as Salḵah:
{5:12} Yo’ĕl was the chief, Shapham the next, then Ya‛anai and Shaphat in Bashan;
{5:13} and their brothers of their father’s house: Miḵa’ĕl, and Meshullam, and Sheḇa, and Yorai, and Yakan, and Ziya, and Ěḇer, seven.
{5:14} These were the children of Aḇiḥayil son of Ḥuri, son of Yarowaḥ, son of Gil‛aḏ, son of Miḵa’ĕl, son of Yeshishai, son of Yaḥdo, son of Buz;
{5:15} Aḥi son of Aḇdi’ĕl, son of Guni, was chief of their father’s house.
{5:16} And they dwelt in Gil‛aḏ, in Bashan and in its villages, and in all the open lands of Sharon within their borders.
{5:17} All these were registered by genealogies in the days of Yotham sovereign of Yehuḏah, and in the days of Yaroḇ‛am sovereign of Yisra’ĕl.
{5:18} The sons of Re’uḇĕn, and the Gaḏites, and half the tribe of Menashsheh had forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty brave men, men able to bear shield and sword, to shoot with the bow, and skilled in battle, going out to the army.
{5:19} And they fought against the Haḡrites, and Yetur, and Naphish, and Noḏaḇ.
{5:20} And they were helped against them, and the Haḡrites were given into their hand, and all who were with them. For they cried out to Elohim in the battle, and He answered their prayer, because they put their trust in Him.
{5:21} And they took away their livestock: fifty thousand of their camels, and two hundred and fifty thousand of their sheep, and two thousand of their donkeys, also one hundred thousand of their men,
{5:22} for many fell dead, because the battle was of Elohim. And they dwelt in their place until the exile.
{5:23} And the children of the half-tribe of Menashsheh dwelt in the land. They increased from Bashan to Ba‛al Ḥermon, that is, to Senir, or Mount Ḥermon.
{5:24} And these were the heads of their fathers’ houses: Ěpher, and Yishi, and Eli’ĕl, and Azri’ĕl, and Yirmeyah, Hoḏawyah, and Yaḥdi’ĕl – mighty brave men, men of name, and heads of their fathers’ houses.
{5:25} But they trespassed against the Elohim of their fathers, and whored after the mighty ones of the peoples of the land, whom Elohim had destroyed before them.

{10:4} And Sha’ul said to his armour-bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised ones come and abuse me.” But his armour-bearer would not, for he was much afraid, so Sha’ul took a sword and fell on it.
{10:5} And when his armour-bearer saw that Sha’ul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died.
{10:6} Thus Sha’ul and his three sons died, and all his house – they died together.
{10:7} And when all the men of Yisra’ĕl who were in the valley saw that they had fled and that Sha’ul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
{10:8} And the next day it came to be, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Sha’ul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
{10:9} And they stripped him and took his head and his armour, and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news among their idols and among the people,
{10:10} and put his armour in the house of their mighty ones, and fastened his head in the house of Daḡon.
{10:11} And all Yaḇĕsh Gil‛aḏ heard of all that the Philistines had done to Sha’ul,
{10:12} and all the brave men arose and took the body of Sha’ul and the bodies of his sons. And they brought them to Yaḇĕsh, and buried their bones under the tamarisk tree at Yaḇĕsh, and fasted seven days.
{10:13} Thus Sha’ul died for his trespass which he had trespassed against יהוה, because he did not guard the Word of יהוה, and also for asking a medium for to make inquiry,
{10:14} and did not inquire of יהוה. So He put him to death, and turned the reign over to Dawiḏ son of Yishai.
{11:1} And all Yisra’ĕl came together to Dawiḏ at Ḥeḇron, saying, “See, we are your bone and your flesh.
{11:2} “Also, in time past, even when Sha’ul was sovereign, you were the one who led Yisra’ĕl out and brought them in. And יהוה your Elohim said to you, ‘Shepherd My people Yisra’ĕl, and be ruler over My people Yisra’ĕl.’”
{11:3} So all the elders of Yisra’ĕl came to the sovereign at Ḥeḇron, and Dawiḏ made a covenant with them at Ḥeḇron before יהוה. And they anointed Dawiḏ sovereign over Yisra’ĕl, according to the word of יהוה by Shemu’ĕl.
{11:4} And Dawiḏ and all Yisra’ĕl went to Yerushalayim, which is Yeḇus, where the Yeḇusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
{11:5} And the inhabitants of Yeḇus said to Dawiḏ, “You do not come in here.” But Dawiḏ captured the stronghold of Tsiyon, the City of Dawiḏ.
{11:6} And Dawiḏ said, “Whoever strikes the Yeḇusites first becomes chief and commander.” And Yo’aḇ son of Tseruyah went up first, and became chief.
{11:7} And Dawiḏ dwelt in the stronghold, so they called it the City of Dawiḏ.
{11:8} And he built the city around it, from Millo round about, and Yo’aḇ revived the rest of the city.
{11:9} And Dawiḏ went on and became great, and יהוה of hosts was with him.
{11:10} And these were the heads of the mighty men whom Dawiḏ had, who strengthened themselves with him in his reign, with all Yisra’ĕl, to set him up to reign over Yisra’ĕl, according to the word of יהוה.
{11:11} And this is the number of the mighty men whom Dawiḏ had: Yashoḇ‛am son of a Ḥaḵmonite, chief of the thirty. He had lifted up his spear against three hundred, slain at one time.
{11:12} And after him was El‛azar son of Doḏo, the Aḥoḥite, who was one of the three mighty men.
{11:13} He was with Dawiḏ at Pasdammim, and the Philistines were gathered there for battle, and a portion of the field was filled with barley, and the people had fled before the Philistines.
{11:14} But they took their stand in the midst of that field, and delivered it, and struck the Philistines. Thus יהוה saved them by a great deliverance.
{11:15} And three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock to Dawiḏ, into the cave of Aḏullam, while the army of the Philistines encamped in the Valley of Repha’im.
{11:16} And Dawiḏ was then in the stronghold, and the watch-post of the Philistines was then in Bĕyth Leḥem.
{11:17} And Dawiḏ longed and said, “Oh, that someone would give me a drink of water from the well of Bĕyth Leḥem, which is by the gate!”
{11:18} And the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water from the well of Bĕyth Leḥem that was by the gate, and took it and brought it to Dawiḏ. But Dawiḏ would not drink it, but poured it out to יהוה.
{11:19} And he said, “Far be it from me, O my Elohim, that I should do this! Should I drink the blood of these men who have risked their lives? For at the risk of their lives they brought it.” And he would not drink it. This is what the three mighty men did.
{11:20} And Aḇishai the brother of Yo’aḇ was chief of another three. And he had lifted up his spear against three hundred men, who were slain, and won a name among the three.
{11:21} Of the three he was more esteemed than the other two men, so he became their head. However he did not come to the first three.
{11:22} Benayah was the son of Yehoyaḏa, the son of a brave man from Qaḇtse’ĕl, who had done many deeds. He struck two lion-like Mo’aḇites. He also went down and struck a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.
{11:23} And he struck a Mitsrian, a man of great height, five cubits tall. And in the Mitsrian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam, and he went down to him with a staff and wrenched the spear out of the Mitsrian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.
{11:24} This is what Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa did, and won a name among the three mighty men.
{11:25} See, he was more esteemed than the thirty, but he did not come to the first three. And Dawiḏ set him over his court.
{11:26} And the mighty men of the armies were Asah’ĕl the brother of Yo’aḇ, Elḥanan son of Doḏo of Bĕyth Leḥem,
{11:27} Shammoth the Harorite, Ḥĕlets the Pelonite,
{11:28} Ira son of Iqqĕsh the Teqowite, Aḇi‛ezer the Anathothite,
{11:29} Sibbeḵai the Ḥushathite, Ilai the Aḥoḥite,
{11:30} Maharai the Netophathite, Ḥĕleḏ son of Ba‛anah the Netophathite,
{11:31} Ithai son of Riḇai of Giḇ‛ah, of the children of Binyamin, Benayah the Pirathonite,
{11:32} Ḥurai of the wadis of Ga‛ash, Aḇi’ĕl the Arbathite,
{11:33} Azmaweth the Baḥarumite, Elyaḥba the Sha‛albonite,
{11:34} the sons of Hashĕm the Gizonite, Yonathan son of Shaḡĕ the Hararite,
{11:35} Aḥyam son of Saḵar the Hararite, Eliphal son of Ur,
{11:36} Ḥĕpher the Mekĕrathite, Aḥiyah the Pelonite,
{11:37} Ḥetsro the Karmelite, Na‛arai son of Ezbai,
{11:38} Yo’ĕl the brother of Nathan, Miḇḥar son of Haḡri,
{11:39} Tseleq the Ammonite, Naḥarai the Bĕrothite (the armour-bearer of Yo’aḇ son of Tseruyah),
{11:40} Ira the Yithrite, Garĕḇ the Yithrite,
{11:41} Uriyah the Ḥittite, Zaḇaḏ son of Aḥlai,
{11:42} Aḏina son of Shiza the Re’uḇĕnite, the head of the Re’uḇĕnites, and thirty with him,
{11:43} Ḥanan son of Ma‛aḵah, and Yoshaphat the Mithnite,
{11:44} Uzziya the Ashterathite, Shama and Ye‛i’ĕl the sons of Ḥotham the Aro‛ĕrite,
{11:45} Yeḏiya’ĕl son of Shimri, and Yoḥa his brother, the Titsite,
{11:46} Eli’ĕl the Maḥawite, and Yeriḇai and Yoshawyah the sons of Elna‛am, Yithmah the Mo’aḇite,
{11:47} Eli’ĕl, and Oḇĕḏ, and Ya‛asi’ĕl of Metsoḇayah.
{12:1} Now these are they who came to Dawiḏ at Tsiqlaḡ while he was still in hiding from Sha’ul son of Qish. And they were among the mighty men, helping the battle,
{12:2} armed with bows, using both the right hand and the left, with stones, and with arrows, with bows, of the brothers of Sha’ul, of Binyamin.
{12:3} The chief was Aḥi‛ezer and Yo’ash, the sons of Shema‛ah the Giḇ‛athite; and Yezaw’ĕl and Pelet, the sons of Azmaweth; and Beraḵah, and Yĕhu the Anathothite;
{12:4} and Yishmayah the Giḇ‛onite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Yirmeyah, and Yaḥazi’ĕl, and Yoḥanan, and Yozaḇaḏ the Geḏĕrathite;
{12:5} Eluzai, and Yerimoth, and Be‛alyah, and Shemaryahu, and Shephatyahu the Ḥaruphite;
{12:6} Elqanah, and Yishshiyahu, and Azar’ĕl, and Yow‛ezer, and Yashoḇ‛am the Qorḥites;
{12:7} and Yo’ĕlah and Zeḇaḏyah, the sons of Yeroḥam of Geḏor.
{12:8} And some Gaḏites separated themselves to Dawiḏ at the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty brave men, men trained for battle, who could handle shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as gazelles on the mountains:
{12:9} Ězer the chief, Oḇaḏyah the second, Eliyaḇ the third,
{12:10} Mishmannah the fourth, Yirmeyah the fifth,
{12:11} Attai the sixth, Eli’ĕl the seventh,
{12:12} Yoḥanan the eighth, Elzaḇaḏ the ninth,
{12:13} Yirmeyahu the tenth, Maḵbannai the eleventh.
{12:14} These were from the sons of Gaḏ, chiefs of the army. The least was over a hundred, and the greatest was over a thousand.
{12:15} These were the ones who passed over the Yardĕn in the first new moon, when it was overflowing all its banks, and put to flight all those in the valleys, to the east and to the west.
{12:16} And some of the children of Binyamin and Yehuḏah came to Dawiḏ at the stronghold.
{12:17} And Dawiḏ went out to face them, and answered and said to them, “If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be united with you; but if to betray me to my enemies – there is no violence in my hands – let the Elohim of our fathers see and reprove.”
{12:18} Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, chief of the officers, “Yours, O Dawiḏ! And with you, O son of Yishai! Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers! For your Elohim shall help you.” And Dawiḏ received them, and put them among the chiefs of the raiding band.
{12:19} And some from Menashsheh went over to Dawiḏ when he was going with the Philistines to battle against Sha’ul. But they did not help them, for the princes of the Philistines took advice and sent him away, saying, “He might go over to his master Sha’ul with our heads!”
{12:20} When he went to Tsiqlaḡ, those of Menashsheh who went over to him were Aḏnah, and Yozaḇaḏ, and Yeḏiya’ĕl, and Miḵa’ĕl, and Yozaḇaḏ, and Elihu, and Tsillethai, chiefs of the thousands who were from Menashsheh.
{12:21} And they helped Dawiḏ against the raiding bands, for they were all mighty brave men, and they were commanders in the army.
{12:22} For at that time they came to Dawiḏ day by day to help him, until it was a great army, like an army of Elohim.
{12:23} And these were the numbers of the chiefs of those that were armed for battle, and came to Dawiḏ at Ḥeḇron to turn over the reign of Sha’ul to him, according to the word of יהוה:
{12:24} Of the children of Yehuḏah bearing shield and spear, six thousand eight hundred armed for battle;
{12:25} of the children of Shim‛on, mighty brave men for the army, seven thousand one hundred;
{12:26} of the children of Lĕwi four thousand six hundred;
{12:27} and Yehoyaḏa, the leader of the Aharonites, and with him three thousand seven hundred;
{12:28} and Tsaḏoq, a young man, a mighty brave man, and from his father’s house twenty-two commanders;
{12:29} and the children of Binyamin, relatives of Sha’ul, three thousand – until then the greatest part of them guarded the charge of the house of Sha’ul;
{12:30} and the children of Ephrayim twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty brave ones, men of name throughout their father’s house;
{12:31} and the half-tribe of Menashsheh eighteen thousand, who were designated by name to come and set up Dawiḏ to reign;
{12:32} and the children of Yissasḵar who had understanding of the times, to know what Yisra’ĕl should do, their chiefs were two hundred. And all their brothers acted at their mouth;
{12:33} of Zeḇulun there were fifty thousand going out to the army, arranging battle with all weapons of battle, giving support with undivided heart;
{12:34} and of Naphtali one thousand commanders, and with them thirty-seven thousand with shield and spear;
{12:35} and of the Danites, arranging battle, twenty-eight thousand six hundred;
{12:36} and of Ashĕr, going out to the army, arranging battle, forty thousand;
{12:37} and of the Re’uḇĕnites and the Gaḏites and the half-tribe of Menashsheh, from beyond the Yardĕn, one hundred and twenty thousand armed for battle with every kind of weapon of battle.
{12:38} All these men of battle, keeping rank, came to Ḥeḇron with a perfect heart, to set up Dawiḏ to reign over all Yisra’ĕl. And all the rest of Yisra’ĕl were of one heart to set up Dawiḏ to reign.
{12:39} And they were there with Dawiḏ three days, eating and drinking, for their brothers had prepared for them.
{12:40} And also those who were near to them, from as far away as Yissasḵar and Zeḇulun and Naphtali, were bringing food on donkeys and camels, on mules and cattle – food of flour and cakes of figs and cakes of raisins, wine and oil and cattle and sheep in great quantities, for there was joy in Yisra’ĕl.
{13:1} And Dawiḏ consulted with the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.
{13:2} And Dawiḏ said to all the assembly of Yisra’ĕl, “If it seems good to you, and if it is of יהוה our Elohim, let us send out to our brothers everywhere who are left in all the land of Yisra’ĕl, and with them to the priests and Lĕwites who are in their cities of their open lands, and let them be gathered to us;
{13:3} and let us bring the ark of our Elohim back to us, for we sought Him not since the days of Sha’ul.”
{13:4} And all the assembly agreed to do so, for the matter was right in the eyes of all the people.
{13:5} So Dawiḏ assembled all Yisra’ĕl, from Shiḥor in Mitsrayim to as far as the entrance of Ḥamath, to bring the ark of Elohim from Qiryath Ye‛arim.
{13:6} And Dawiḏ and all Yisra’ĕl went up to Ba‛alah, to Qiryath Ye‛arim of Yehuḏah, to bring up from there the ark of Elohim, יהוה, who dwells between the keruḇim, where the Name is called on.
{13:7} And they placed the ark of Elohim on a new wagon from the house of Aḇinaḏaḇ, and Uzza and Aḥyo were leading the wagon.
{13:8} And Dawiḏ and all Yisra’ĕl were playing before Elohim with all their might, and with songs, and with lyres, and with harps, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
{13:9} And when they came to the threshing-floor of Kiḏon, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled.
{13:10} Then the wrath of יהוה burned against Uzza, and He struck him because he put his hand to the ark. And he died there before Elohim.
{13:11} And Dawiḏ was displeased because יהוה had broken out against Uzza, therefore that place is called Perets Uzza, until this day.
{13:12} And Dawiḏ was afraid of Elohim that day, saying, “How shall I bring the ark of Elohim to me?”
{13:13} So Dawiḏ did not take the ark with him into the City of Dawiḏ, but took it aside into the house of Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom the Gittite.
{13:14} And the ark of Elohim remained with the household of Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom in his house three new moons. And יהוה blessed the house of Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom and all that he had.
{14:1} And Ḥiram sovereign of Tsor sent messengers to Dawiḏ, and cedar trees, with stonemasons and carpenters, to build him a house.
{14:2} And Dawiḏ knew that יהוה had established him as sovereign over Yisra’ĕl, for his reign was highly exalted for the sake of His people Yisra’ĕl.
{14:3} And Dawiḏ took more wives in Yerushalayim, and Dawiḏ brought forth more sons and daughters.
{14:4} And these are the names of his children whom he had in Yerushalayim: Shammua and Shoḇaḇ, Nathan and Shelomoh,
{14:5} and Yiḇḥar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,
{14:6} and Noḡah, and Nepheḡ, and Yaphiya,
{14:7} and Elishama, and Be‛elyaḏa, and Eliphelet.
{14:8} And when the Philistines heard that Dawiḏ had been anointed sovereign over all Yisra’ĕl, all the Philistines went up to seek Dawiḏ. And Dawiḏ heard and went out against them.
{14:9} And the Philistines came and made a raid on the Valley of Repha’im.
{14:10} And Dawiḏ inquired of Elohim, saying, “Do I go up against the Philistines? And shall You give them into my hand?” And יהוה said to him, “Go up, and I shall give them into your hand.”
{14:11} And they went up to Ba‛al Peratsim, and Dawiḏ struck them there. Then Dawiḏ said, “Elohim has broken through my enemies by my hand like a breakthrough of water.” So they called the name of that place Ba‛al Peratsim.
{14:12} And they left their mighty ones there, so Dawiḏ commanded, and they were burned with fire.
{14:13} And the Philistines once again made a raid on the valley.
{14:14} And Dawiḏ again inquired of Elohim, and Elohim said to him, “Do not go up after them. Go around them, and come upon them in front of the mulberry trees.
{14:15} “And it shall be, when you hear a sound of stepping in the tops of the mulberry trees, then go out to battle, for Elohim shall go out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.”
{14:16} And Dawiḏ did as Elohim commanded him, and they struck the army of the Philistines from Giḇ‛on as far as Gezer.
{14:17} And the name of Dawiḏ went out into all lands, and יהוה put the dread of him upon all nations.
{15:1} And he built houses for himself in the City of Dawiḏ. And he prepared a place for the ark of Elohim, and pitched a tent for it.
{15:2} Then Dawiḏ said, “No one is to lift the ark of Elohim but the Lĕwites, for יהוה has chosen them to lift the ark of Elohim and to serve Him forever.”
{15:3} And Dawiḏ assembled all Yisra’ĕl at Yerushalayim, to bring up the ark of יהוה to its place, which he had prepared for it.
{15:4} And Dawiḏ gathered the children of Aharon and the Lĕwites;
{15:5} of the sons of Qehath: Uri’ĕl the chief, and one hundred and twenty of his brothers;
{15:6} of the sons of Merari: Asayah the chief, and two hundred and twenty of his brothers;
{15:7} of the sons of Gĕreshom: Yo’ĕl the chief, and one hundred and thirty of his brothers;
{15:8} of the sons of Elitsaphan: Shemayah the chief, and two hundred of his brothers;
{15:9} of the sons of Ḥeḇron: Eli’ĕl the chief, and eighty of his brothers;
{15:10} of the sons of Uzzi’ĕl: Amminaḏaḇ the chief, and one hundred and twelve of his brothers.
{15:11} And Dawiḏ called for Tsaḏoq and Eḇyathar the priests, and for the Lĕwites, for Uri’ĕl, Asayah, and Yo’ĕl, Shemayah, and Eli’ĕl, and Amminaḏaḇ,
{15:12} and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Lĕwites. Set yourselves apart, you and your brothers, then you shall bring up the ark of יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl to the place I have prepared for it.
{15:13} “Because you did not do it the first time, יהוה our Elohim broke out against us, because we did not ask Him about the right-ruling.”
{15:14} So the priests and the Lĕwites set themselves apart, to bring up the ark of יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl.
{15:15} And the children of the Lĕwites bore the ark of Elohim on their shoulders, by its poles, as Mosheh had commanded according to the word of יהוה.
{15:16} And Dawiḏ spoke to the leaders of the Lĕwites to appoint their brothers the singers with instruments of song, harps, and lyres, and cymbals, to lift up the voice with joy.
{15:17} And the Lĕwites appointed Hĕman son of Yo’ĕl, and of his brothers, Asaph son of Bereḵyahu; and of their brothers, the sons of Merari, Ěythan son of Qushayahu;
{15:18} and with them their brothers of the second rank: Zeḵaryahu, Bĕn, and Ya‛azi’ĕl, and Shemiramoth, and Yeḥi’ĕl, and Unni, Eliyaḇ, and Benayahu, and Ma‛asĕyahu, and Mattithyahu, and Eliphelĕhu, and Miqnĕyahu, and Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom, and Ye‛i’ĕl, the gatekeepers;
{15:19} and the singers Hĕman, Asaph, and Ěythan, were to sound the cymbals of bronze;
{15:20} and Zeḵaryah, and Azi’ĕl, and Shemiramoth, and Yeḥi’ĕl, and Unni, and Eliyaḇ, and Ma‛asĕyahu, and Benayahu, with harps according to Alamoth;
{15:21} and Mattithyahu, and Eliphelĕhu, and Miqnĕyahu, and Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom, and Ye‛i’ĕl, and Azazyahu, to lead with lyres on the Sheminith;
{15:22} and Kenanyahu, leader of the Lĕwites in the song, instructed in the song because he was skilled;
{15:23} and Bereḵyah and Elqanah were doorkeepers for the ark;
{15:24} and Sheḇanyahu, and Yoshaphat, and Nethan’ĕl, and Amasai, and Zeḵaryahu, and Benayahu, and Eli‛ezer, the priests, were to blow the trumpets before the ark of Elohim. And Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom and Yeḥiyah, were doorkeepers for the ark.
{15:25} And it was Dawiḏ and the elders of Yisra’ĕl, and the commanders over thousands, who went to bring up the ark of the covenant of יהוה from the house of Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom with joy.
{15:26} And it came to be, when Elohim helped the Lĕwites who bore the ark of the covenant of יהוה, that they slaughtered seven bulls and seven rams.
{15:27} And Dawiḏ was dressed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Lĕwites who bore the ark, the singers, and Kenanyah the leader of the service with the singers. And Dawiḏ wore a linen shoulder garment.
{15:28} So all Yisra’ĕl brought up the ark of the covenant of יהוה with shouting and with a voice of a shophar, with trumpets and with cymbals, sounding with harps and lyres.
{15:29} And it came to be, as the ark of the covenant of יהוה came to the City of Dawiḏ, that Miḵal the daughter of Sha’ul, looking through a window, saw Sovereign Dawiḏ dancing and playing. And she despised him in her heart.
{16:1} And they brought the ark of Elohim, and set it in the midst of the Tent that Dawiḏ had pitched for it. And they brought ascending offerings and peace offerings before Elohim.
{16:2} And when Dawiḏ had made an end of offering the ascending offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the Name of יהוה,
{16:3} and gave a portion to everyone of Yisra’ĕl, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread, a measure, and a cake of raisins.
{16:4} And he appointed some of the Lĕwites to serve before the ark of יהוה, to bring to remembrance, and to thank, and to praise יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl:
{16:5} Asaph the chief, and his second Zeḵaryah, Ye‛i’ĕl, and Shemiramoth, and Yeḥi’ĕl, and Mattithyah, and Eliyaḇ, and Benayahu, and Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom, and Ye‛i’ĕl, with harps and lyres, but Asaph was sounding with cymbals;
{16:6} and Benayahu and Yaḥazi’ĕl the priests continually blew the trumpets before the ark of the covenant of Elohim.
{16:7} And on that day Dawiḏ first gave thanks to יהוה by the hand of Asaph and his brothers:
{16:8} Give thanks to יהוה, call upon His Name, Make known His deeds among the peoples!
{16:9} Sing to Him, sing praise to Him, Speak of all His wonders!
{16:10} Boast in His set-apart Name, Let the hearts of those seeking יהוה rejoice!
{16:11} Seek יהוה and His strength, Seek His face continually!
{16:12} Remember His wonders which He has done, His signs and the right-rulings of His mouth,
{16:13} O seed of Yisra’ĕl, His servant; O children of Ya‛aqoḇ, His chosen ones!
{16:14} He is יהוה our Elohim, His right-rulings are in all the earth.
{16:15} Remember His covenant forever, The Word He commanded for a thousand generations,
{16:16} Which He made with Aḇraham, And His oath to Yitsḥaq,
{16:17} And He established it to Ya‛aqoḇ for a law, To Yisra’ĕl as an everlasting covenant,
{16:18} Saying, “To you I give the land of Kena‛an, The portion of your inheritance,”
{16:19} When you were but few in number, Few indeed, and sojourners in it.
{16:20} And they went up and down, From one nation to another, And from one reign to another people.
{16:21} He allowed no one to oppress them, And He reproved sovereigns for their sakes, saying:
{16:22} “Do not touch My anointed ones, And do My prophets no evil.”
{16:23} Sing to יהוה, all the earth; Proclaim His deliverance from day to day.
{16:24} Declare His esteem among the nations, His wonders among all peoples.
{16:25} For great is יהוה and greatly to be praised; And He is to be feared above all mighty ones.
{16:26} For all the mighty ones of the peoples are matters of naught, But יהוה made the heavens.
{16:27} Excellency and splendour are before Him, Strength and gladness are in His place.
{16:28} Ascribe to יהוה, O clans of the peoples, Ascribe to יהוה esteem and strength.
{16:29} Ascribe to יהוה the esteem of His Name; Bring an offering, and come before Him; Bow yourself to יהוה In the splendour of set-apartness!
{16:30} Tremble before Him, all the earth. The world also is firmly established, immovable.
{16:31} Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; And let them say among the nations, “יהוה shall reign.”
{16:32} Let the sea roar, and all that fills it; Let the field rejoice, and all that is in it.
{16:33} Let the trees of the forest then sing before יהוה, For He shall come to judge the earth.
{16:34} Give thanks to יהוה, for He is good, For His loving-commitment is everlasting!
{16:35} And say, “Save us, O Elohim of our deliverance; And gather us together, And deliver us from the nations, To give thanks to Your set-apart Name, And boast in Your praise.”
{16:36} Blessed be יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl From everlasting to everlasting! And all the people said, “Amĕn!” and praised יהוה.
{16:37} So he left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of יהוה to perform regular service before the ark, as each day required;
{16:38} also, Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom with his sixty-eight brothers, including Oḇĕḏ-Eḏom son of Yeḏuthun, and Ḥosah, to be gatekeepers;
{16:39} and Tsaḏoq the priest and his brothers the priests, before the Dwelling Place of יהוה at the high place that was at Giḇ‛on,
{16:40} to offer ascending offerings to יהוה on the slaughter-place of ascending offering regularly morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the Torah of יהוה which He commanded Yisra’ĕl;
{16:41} and with them Hĕman and Yeḏuthun and the rest who were chosen, who were designated by name, to give thanks to יהוה, because His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{16:42} and with them Hĕman and Yeḏuthun, to sound aloud with trumpets and cymbals and instruments for the songs of Elohim, and the sons of Yeḏuthun for the gate.
{16:43} And all the people went, each one to his house, and Dawiḏ returned to bless his house.
{17:1} And it came to be, when Dawiḏ was dwelling in his house, that Dawiḏ said to Nathan the prophet, “See, I am dwelling in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of יהוה is under curtains.”
{17:2} And Nathan said to Dawiḏ, “Do all that is in your heart, for Elohim is with you.”
{17:3} And it came to be that night that the word of Elohim came to Nathan, saying,
{17:4} “Go, and you shall say to My servant Dawiḏ, ‘Thus said יהוה, “You do not build Me a house to dwell in.
{17:5} “For I have not dwelt in a house since the time that I brought up Yisra’ĕl, even to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one Dwelling Place to another.
{17:6} “Wherever I have moved about with all Yisra’ĕl, have I ever spoken a word to any of the rulers of Yisra’ĕl, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’”’
{17:7} “And now, say this to My servant Dawiḏ, ‘Thus said יהוה of hosts, “I took you from the sheepfold, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people Yisra’ĕl.
{17:8} “And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made you a name like the name of the great men who are on the earth.
{17:9} “And I shall prepare a place for My people Yisra’ĕl and plant them, and they shall dwell in a place of their own and move no more, nor shall the sons of wickedness oppress them any more, as at the first,
{17:10} since the time that I commanded rulers to be over My people Yisra’ĕl, and I have humbled all your enemies. And I declared to you that יהוה does build you a house.
{17:11} “And it shall be, when your days are filled to go to be with your fathers, that I shall raise up your seed after you, who is of your sons. And I shall establish his reign.
{17:12} “He does build Me a house, and I shall establish his throne forever.
{17:13} “I am to be his Father, and he is to be My son. And My loving-commitment I do not turn away from him, as I took it from him who was before you.
{17:14} “And I shall establish him in My house and in My reign forever, and let his throne be established forever.”’”
{17:15} According to all these words and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to Dawiḏ.
{17:16} And Sovereign Dawiḏ came in and sat before יהוה, and said, “Who am I, O יהוה Elohim? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far?
{17:17} “And this was a small matter in Your eyes, O Elohim, but You have spoken of Your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have looked upon me as though I were an exalted man, O יהוה Elohim.
{17:18} “What more could Dawiḏ add to You for the esteem of Your servant? For You know Your servant.
{17:19} “O יהוה, for Your servant’s sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness, in making known all these great matters.
{17:20} “O יהוה, there is none like You, nor is there any Elohim besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
{17:21} “And who is like Your people Yisra’ĕl, the one nation on the earth whom Elohim went to redeem for Himself as a people; to make for Yourself a great and awesome Name, by driving out nations from before Your people whom You redeemed from Mitsrayim?
{17:22} “For You appointed Your people Yisra’ĕl to be Your own people forever. And You, יהוה, have become their Elohim.
{17:23} “And now, O יהוה, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, let it stand fast forever, and do as You have said.
{17:24} “So let it stand fast, and Your Name be great forever, saying, ‘יהוה of hosts, Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, is Elohim to Yisra’ĕl. And let the house of Your servant Dawiḏ be established before You.’
{17:25} “For You, O my Elohim, have revealed to Your servant to build a house for him. Therefore Your servant has found courage to pray before You.
{17:26} “And now, יהוה, You are Elohim, and have promised this goodness to Your servant.
{17:27} “And now, You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant to be before You forever. For You have blessed it, O יהוה, and it is blessed forever.”
{18:1} And after this it came to be that Dawiḏ struck the Philistines, and humbled them, and took Gath and its towns from the hand of the Philistines.
{18:2} And he struck the Mo’aḇites, and the Mo’aḇites became Dawiḏ’s servants, and brought presents.
{18:3} And Dawiḏ struck Haḏaḏezer sovereign of Tsoḇah as far as Ḥamath, as he went to establish his power by the River Euphrates.
{18:4} And Dawiḏ took from him one thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. And Dawiḏ also hamstrung all the chariot horses, but left of them for one hundred chariots.
{18:5} And when Aram of Darmeseq came to help Haḏaḏezer sovereign of Tsoḇah, Dawiḏ struck twenty-two thousand of Aram,
{18:6} and Dawiḏ stationed men in Aram of Darmeseq, and the Arameans became Dawiḏ’s servants, and brought presents. And יהוה saved Dawiḏ wherever he went.
{18:7} And Dawiḏ took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Haḏaḏezer, and brought them to Yerushalayim.
{18:8} And from Tiḇḥath and from Kun, cities of Haḏaḏezer, Dawiḏ brought a large amount of bronze, with which Shelomoh made the bronze Sea, and the columns, and the vessels of bronze.
{18:9} And when To‛u sovereign of Ḥamath heard that Dawiḏ had stricken all the army of Haḏaḏezer sovereign of Tsoḇah,
{18:10} he sent Haḏoram his son to Sovereign Dawiḏ, to ask peace of him and bless him, because he had fought against Haḏaḏezer and struck him – because Haḏaḏezer had been fighting against To‛u – with all kinds of objects of gold, and silver, and bronze.
{18:11} Sovereign Dawiḏ also set these apart to יהוה, along with the silver and gold that he had brought from all these nations, from Eḏom, and from Mo’aḇ, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalĕq.
{18:12} And Aḇishai son of Tseruyah struck eighteen thousand Eḏomites in the Valley of Salt,
{18:13} and he put watch-posts in Eḏom, and all the Eḏomites became Dawiḏ’s servants. And יהוה saved Dawiḏ wherever he went.
{18:14} So Dawiḏ reigned over all Yisra’ĕl, and he was doing right-ruling and righteousness to all his people.
{18:15} And Yo’aḇ son of Tseruyah was over the army, and Yehoshaphat son of Aḥiluḏ was recorder,
{18:16} and Tsaḏoq son of Aḥituḇ and Aḇimeleḵ son of Eḇyathar were the priests, and Shawsha was the scribe,
{18:17} and Benayahu son of Yehoyaḏa was over the Kerĕthites and the Pelĕthites. And the sons of Dawiḏ were chiefs at the sovereign’s side.
{19:1} And after this it came to be that Naḥash the sovereign of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place.
{19:2} And Dawiḏ said, “Let me show loving-commitment to Ḥanun son of Naḥash, because his father showed loving-commitment to me.” So Dawiḏ sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And the servants of Dawiḏ came to Ḥanun in the land of the children of Ammon to comfort him.
{19:3} And the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Ḥanun, “Is Dawiḏ esteeming your father, in your eyes, because he has sent comforters to you? Have his servants not come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?”
{19:4} So Ḥanun took Dawiḏ’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, at their buttocks, and sent them away.
{19:5} And when some went and informed Dawiḏ about the men, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. And the sovereign said, “Remain at Yeriḥo until your beards have grown, then return.”
{19:6} And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves a stench to Dawiḏ, Ḥanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Aram-Naharayim, and from Aram-Ma‛aḵah, and from Tsoḇah.
{19:7} So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, with the sovereign of Ma‛aḵah and his people, who came and encamped before Mĕyḏeḇa. And the children of Ammon had gathered from their cities, and came to battle.
{19:8} And when Dawiḏ heard, he sent Yo’aḇ and the entire army of the mighty men,
{19:9} and the children of Ammon came out and put themselves in battle array before the gate of the city, and the sovereigns who had come were by themselves in the field.
{19:10} And when Yo’aḇ saw that the battle had been set against him before and behind, he chose some of the choice ones of Yisra’ĕl, and put them in battle array to meet Aram.
{19:11} And the rest of the people he put under the command of Aḇishai his brother, and they set themselves in battle array to meet the children of Ammon.
{19:12} And he said, “If Aram is too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I shall help you.
{19:13} “Be strong, and let us show strength for our people and for the cities of our Elohim, and let יהוה do what is good in His eyes.”
{19:14} And Yo’aḇ drew near, and the people with him, to battle against Aram, and they fled before him.
{19:15} And when the children of Ammon saw that the Arameans were fleeing, they also fled before Aḇishai his brother, and went into the city. And Yo’aḇ came to Yerushalayim.
{19:16} And when Aram saw that they had been smitten before Yisra’ĕl, they sent messengers and brought the Arameans who were beyond the River, and Shophaḵ the commander of Haḏaḏezer’s army went before them.
{19:17} And it was reported to Dawiḏ, and he gathered all Yisra’ĕl, and passed over the Yardĕn and came upon them, and set up in battle array against them. And Dawiḏ set up in battle array against Aram, and they fought with him.
{19:18} And Aram fled before Yisra’ĕl, and Dawiḏ killed seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers of the Arameans, and smote Shophaḵ the commander of the army.
{19:19} And the servants of Haḏaḏezer saw that they were smitten by Yisra’ĕl, and they made peace with Dawiḏ and became his servants. And the Arameans would not help the children of Ammon any more.
{20:1} And it came to be at the turn of the year, at the time sovereigns go out to battle, that Yo’aḇ led out the power of the army and destroyed the land of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But Dawiḏ remained at Yerushalayim. And Yo’aḇ struck Rabbah and overthrew it.
{20:2} And Dawiḏ took their sovereign’s crown from his head, and found it weighed a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it. And it was set on Dawiḏ’s head. And he also brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount.
{20:3} And he brought out the people who were in it, and put them to work with saws, and with iron picks, and with axes. And thus Dawiḏ did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then Dawiḏ and all the people returned to Yerushalayim.
{20:4} And afterward it came to be that fighting broke out at Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbeḵai the Ḥushathite struck Sippai of the sons of the giant, and they were humbled.
{20:5} And there was fighting again with the Philistines, and Elḥanan son of Ya’ir struck Laḥmi the brother of Golyath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
{20:6} And there was fighting again at Gath, where there was a man of great size, with twenty-four fingers and toes, six and six. And he too was born to the giant.
{20:7} And he reproached Yisra’ĕl, and Yehonathan son of Shim‛a, Dawiḏ’s brother, struck him.
{20:8} These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of Dawiḏ and by the hand of his servants.
{21:1} And Satan stood up against Yisra’ĕl, and moved Dawiḏ to number Yisra’ĕl.
{21:2} And Dawiḏ said to Yo’aḇ and to the rulers of the people, “Go, number Yisra’ĕl from Be’ĕrsheḇa to Dan, and bring the number of them to me so that I know it.”
{21:3} And Yo’aḇ answered, “יהוה does add to His people a hundred times more than they are. But, my master the sovereign, are they not all my master’s servants? Why does my master seek to do this? Why should he be a cause of guilt in Yisra’ĕl?”
{21:4} But the sovereign’s word was strong against Yo’aḇ. And Yo’aḇ left and went throughout all Yisra’ĕl and came to Yerushalayim.
{21:5} And Yo’aḇ gave the sum of the number of the people to Dawiḏ. And all Yisra’ĕl had one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and Yehuḏah had four hundred and seventy thousand men who drew the sword.
{21:6} But he did not number Lĕwi and Binyamin among them, for the sovereign’s word was loathsome to Yo’aḇ.
{21:7} And it was evil in the eyes of Elohim, concerning this matter, and He struck Yisra’ĕl.
{21:8} Then Dawiḏ said to Elohim, “I have sinned greatly, because I have done this matter. But now, I pray, take away the crookedness of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.”
{21:9} And יהוה spoke to Gaḏ, Dawiḏ’s seer, saying,
{21:10} “Go, and you shall speak to Dawiḏ, saying, ‘Thus said יהוה, “I hold three options before you – choose one of them for yourself, and I do it to you.”’”
{21:11} So Gaḏ came to Dawiḏ and said to him, “Thus said יהוה, ‘Choose for yourself
{21:12} either three years of scarcity of food, or three new moons to be defeated by your foes with the sword of your enemies overtaking you, or else for three days the sword of יהוה, even the plague in the land, with the messenger of יהוה destroying throughout all the borders of Yisra’ĕl.’ And now consider what answer I am to return to Him who sent me.”
{21:13} And Dawiḏ said to Gaḏ, “I am in great trouble. Please let me fall into the hand of יהוה, for His compassion is very great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”
{21:14} And יהוה sent a plague upon Yisra’ĕl, and seventy thousand men of Yisra’ĕl fell.
{21:15} And Elohim sent a messenger to Yerushalayim to destroy it. And as he was destroying, יהוה saw, and relented about the evil, and said to the messenger who was destroying, “Enough! Now stop your hand.” And the messenger of יהוה was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Yeḇusite.
{21:16} And Dawiḏ lifted his eyes and saw the messenger of יהוה standing between earth and the heavens, having in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Yerushalayim. And Dawiḏ and the elders, wrapped in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
{21:17} And Dawiḏ said to Elohim, “Was it not I who commanded the people to be numbered? I am the one who has sinned and done evil indeed. But these, the sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, O יהוה my Elohim, be against me and my father’s house, but not against Your people, to be plagued.”
{21:18} And the messenger of יהוה commanded Gaḏ to say to Dawiḏ that Dawiḏ should go up to raise a slaughter-place to יהוה on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Yeḇusite.
{21:19} So Dawiḏ went up at the word of Gaḏ, which he had spoken in the Name of יהוה.
{21:20} And Ornan turned and saw the messenger. And his four sons with him hid themselves, and Ornan was threshing wheat.
{21:21} And Dawiḏ came to Ornan, and Ornan looked and saw Dawiḏ, and he went out from the threshing-floor, and bowed down to Dawiḏ with his face to the ground.
{21:22} And Dawiḏ said to Ornan, “Give me the site of the threshing-floor, so that I build a slaughter-place to יהוה on it. Give it to me at the complete price, so that the plague is restrained from the people.”
{21:23} And Ornan said to Dawiḏ, “Take it for yourself, and let my master the sovereign do what is good in his eyes. See, I shall give you the cattle for ascending offerings, the threshing implements for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I give it all.”
{21:24} And Sovereign Dawiḏ said to Ornan, “No, but I shall certainly buy it at the complete price, for I do not take what is yours for יהוה, nor offer an ascending offering without cost.”
{21:25} And Dawiḏ gave Ornan six hundred sheqels of gold by weight for the place.
{21:26} And Dawiḏ built there a slaughter-place to יהוה, and offered ascending offerings and peace offerings, and called on יהוה. And He answered him from the heavens by fire on the slaughter-place of ascending offering.
{21:27} Then יהוה commanded the messenger, and he returned his sword to its sheath.
{21:28} At that time, when Dawiḏ saw that יהוה had answered him on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Yeḇusite, he slaughtered there,
{21:29} for the Dwelling Place of יהוה and the slaughter-place of the ascending offering, which Mosheh had made in the wilderness, were at that time at the high place in Giḇ‛on.
{21:30} But Dawiḏ was unable to go before it to inquire of Elohim, for he was afraid of the sword of the messenger of יהוה.
{22:1} Dawiḏ then said, “This is the House of יהוה Elohim, and this is the slaughter-place of ascending offering for Yisra’ĕl.”
{22:2} And Dawiḏ commanded to gather the foreigners who were in the land of Yisra’ĕl. And he appointed stonemasons to cut hewn stones to build the House of Elohim.
{22:3} And Dawiḏ prepared large quantities of iron for the nails of the doors of the gates and for the clamps, and more bronze than could be weighed,
{22:4} and cedar trees beyond number, for the Tsiḏonians and those from Tsor brought much cedar wood to Dawiḏ.
{22:5} And Dawiḏ said, “Shelomoh my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for יהוה is to be exceedingly great, for a splendid Name, to all the lands. Please, let me make preparation for it.” So Dawiḏ made extensive preparations before his death.
{22:6} He also called for his son Shelomoh, and commanded him to build a house for יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl.
{22:7} And Dawiḏ said to Shelomoh, “My son, as for me, it has been in my heart to build a house to the Name of יהוה my Elohim,
{22:8} but the word of יהוה came to me, saying, ‘You have shed much blood and have fought great battles. You do not build a house for My Name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in My presence.
{22:9} See, a son is to be born to you, who is a man of rest. And I shall give him rest from all his enemies all around, for Shelomoh is his name, and peace and rest I give to Yisra’ĕl in his days.
{22:10} He does build a house for My Name, and he is to be My son, and I am to be his Father. And I shall establish the throne of his reign over Yisra’ĕl forever.’
{22:11} “Now, my son, יהוה be with you, then you shall prosper and build the House of יהוה your Elohim, as He has said to you.
{22:12} “Only, let יהוה give you wisdom and understanding, and command you concerning Yisra’ĕl, so that you guard the Torah of יהוה your Elohim,
{22:13} then you shall prosper, if you guard to do the laws and right-rulings with which יהוה commanded Mosheh concerning Yisra’ĕl. Be strong and brave, do not fear nor be discouraged.
{22:14} “See, in my affliction I have prepared for the House of יהוה one hundred thousand talents of gold and one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond measure, for it is plenty. And I have prepared timber and stone, and you shall add to them.
{22:15} “And with you there are many workmen: hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all types of skilled men for every kind of work.
{22:16} “Of gold and silver and bronze and iron there is no limit. Rise up and do, and יהוה is with you.”
{22:17} And Dawiḏ commanded all the rulers of Yisra’ĕl to help Shelomoh his son, saying,
{22:18} “Is not יהוה your Elohim with you? And has He not given you rest all around? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land has been subdued before יהוה and before His people.
{22:19} “Now, give your heart and your being to seek יהוה your Elohim. And rise up and build the set-apart place of יהוה Elohim, to bring the ark of the covenant of יהוה and the set-apart vessels of Elohim into the house that is to be built for the Name of יהוה.”
{23:1} And Dawiḏ was old and satisfied with days, and he made his son Shelomoh to reign over Yisra’ĕl,
{23:2} and he gathered all the rulers of Yisra’ĕl, with the priests and the Lĕwites.
{23:3} And the Lĕwites were numbered from the age of thirty years and above. And their number, head by head, was thirty-eight thousand males.
{23:4} Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the House of יהוה, and six thousand were officers and judges,
{23:5} and four thousand were gatekeepers, and four thousand to give praise to יהוה, “which I made for giving praise.”
{23:6} And Dawiḏ divided them into divisions, of the sons of Lĕwi: of Gĕrshon, Qehath, and Merari.
{23:7} Of the Gĕrshonites: La‛dan and Shim‛i.
{23:8} The sons of La‛dan: Yeḥi’ĕl the head, then Zĕtham and Yo’ĕl, three.
{23:9} The sons of Shim‛i: Shelomith, and Ḥazi’ĕl, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’ houses of La‛dan.
{23:10} And the sons of Shim‛i: Yaḥath, Zina, and Ye‛ush, and Beri‛ah. These were the four sons of Shim‛i.
{23:11} And Yaḥath was the head and Zizah the second. But Ye‛ush and Beri‛ah did not have many sons, so they were reckoned as one father’s house.
{23:12} The sons of Qehath: Amram, Yitshar, Ḥeḇron, and Uzzi’ĕl, four.
{23:13} The sons of Amram: Aharon and Mosheh. And Aharon was set apart, he and his sons forever, that he should set apart the most set-apart, to burn incense before יהוה, to serve Him, and to give the blessing in His Name forever.
{23:14} Now Mosheh, the man of Elohim, his sons were named after the tribe of Lĕwi.
{23:15} The sons of Mosheh: Gĕreshom and Eli‛ezer.
{23:16} The sons of Gĕreshom: Sheḇu’ĕl was the head.
{23:17} And the sons of Eli‛ezer: Reḥaḇyah was the head. And Eli‛ezer had no other sons, but the sons of Reḥaḇyah were very many.
{23:18} The sons of Yitshar: Shelomith was the head.
{23:19} The sons of Ḥeḇron: Yeriyahu was the head, Amaryah the second, Yaḥazi’ĕl the third, and Yeqam‛am the fourth.
{23:20} The sons of Uzzi’ĕl: Miḵah was the head and Yishshiyah the second.
{23:21} The sons of Merari: Maḥli and Mushi. The sons of Maḥli: El‛azar and Qish.
{23:22} And El‛azar died, and had no sons, but only daughters. And their brothers, the sons of Qish, took them.
{23:23} The sons of Mushi: Maḥli, Ěḏer, and Yerĕmoth, three.
{23:24} These were the sons of Lĕwi by their fathers’ houses, the heads of the fathers’ houses as they were counted head by head by the number of their names, who did the work for the service of the House of יהוה, from the age of twenty years and above.
{23:25} For Dawiḏ said, “יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl has given rest to His people, and He dwells in Yerushalayim forever,”
{23:26} and also of the Lĕwites, “They shall no longer bear the Dwelling Place, or any of the vessels for its service.”
{23:27} For by the last words of Dawiḏ the Lĕwites were numbered from twenty years old and above,
{23:28} because their duty was to help the sons of Aharon in the service of the House of יהוה, in the courtyards and in the rooms, in the cleansing of all that was set-apart, and the work of the service of the House of Elohim,
{23:29} both with the showbread and the fine flour for the grain offering, and with the unleavened cakes and what is baked on the griddle, and with what is mixed and with all kinds of measures and sizes;
{23:30} and to stand every morning to thank and praise יהוה, and so at evening;
{23:31} and for all the ascending offerings to יהוה on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the appointed times, by number according to the right-ruling upon them, continually before יהוה;
{23:32} and that they should guard the duty of the Tent of Appointment, the duty of the set-apart place, and the duty of the sons of Aharon their brothers in the service of the House of יהוה.
{24:1} And the divisions of the sons of Aharon: The sons of Aharon were Naḏaḇ and Aḇihu, El‛azar and Ithamar.
{24:2} But Naḏaḇ and Aḇihu died before their father, and had no children, so El‛azar and Ithamar served as priests.
{24:3} And Dawiḏ, with Tsaḏoq of the sons of El‛azar, and Aḥimeleḵ of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their offices in their service.
{24:4} And there were more leaders found of the sons of El‛azar than of the sons of Ithamar. So they divided the sons of El‛azar into sixteen heads of their fathers’ houses, and the sons of Ithamar into eight heads of their fathers’ houses.
{24:5} And they were divided by lot, one group as another, for there were officials of the set-apart place and officials of Elohim, from the sons of El‛azar and from the sons of Ithamar.
{24:6} And the scribe, Shemayah son of Nethan’ĕl, one of the Lĕwites, wrote them down before the sovereign, and the rulers, and Tsaḏoq the priest, and Aḥimeleḵ son of Eḇyathar, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the priests and Lĕwites, one father’s house taken for El‛azar and one for Ithamar.

{25:1} And Dawiḏ and the commanders of the army separated for the service some of the sons of Asaph, and of Hĕman, and of Yeḏuthun, who should prophesy with lyres, with harps, and with cymbals. And the number of the workmen according to their service was:

{25:7} And the number of them, with their brothers who were taught in the songs of יהוה, all who were skilled, was two hundred and eighty-eight.

{26:11} Ḥilqiyahu the second, Teḇalyahu the third, Zeḵaryahu the fourth. All the sons and brothers of Ḥosah were thirteen.
{26:12} These divisions of the gatekeepers, among the chief men, had duties like their brothers, to serve in the House of יהוה.
{26:13} And they cast lots for each gate, the small as well as the great, according to their father’s house.
{26:14} And the lot to the east fell to Shelemyahu. Then they cast lots for his son Zeḵaryahu, a wise counsellor, and his lot came out to the north;

{26:25} And his brothers by Eli‛ezer were Reḥaḇyahu his son, and Yeshayahu his son, and Yoram his son, and Ziḵri his son, and Shelomoth his son.
{26:26} This Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasuries of the set-apart gifts which Sovereign Dawiḏ and the heads of fathers’ houses, the commanders over thousands and hundreds, and the commanders of the army, had set apart.
{26:27} Some of the booty won in battles they set apart to maintain the House of יהוה.
{26:28} And all that Shemu’ĕl the seer, and Sha’ul son of Qish, and Aḇnĕr son of Nĕr, and Yo’aḇ son of Tseruyah had set apart, all who were setting apart, were under the hand of Shelomith and his brothers.

{26:32} And his brothers were two thousand seven hundred able men, heads of fathers’ houses, whom Sovereign Dawiḏ made officials over the Re’uḇĕnites, and the Gaḏites, and the half-tribe of Menashsheh, in all matters of Elohim and matters of the sovereign.
{27:1} And the children of Yisra’ĕl, according to their number, the heads of fathers’ houses, and the commanders of thousands and hundreds and their officers, served the sovereign in all matters of the divisions which came in and went out new moon by new moon throughout all the new moons of the year, each division having twenty-four thousand.
{27:2} Over the first division for the first new moon was Yashoḇ‛am son of Zaḇdi’ĕl, and in his division were twenty-four thousand;

{27:22} Dan: Azar’ĕl son of Yeroḥam. These were the rulers of the tribes of Yisra’ĕl.
{27:23} But Dawiḏ did not take the number of those twenty years old and under, because יהוה had said He would increase Yisra’ĕl like the stars of the heavens.
{27:24} Yo’aḇ son of Tseruyah began a census, but he did not finish, for wrath came upon Yisra’ĕl because of this census; nor was the number recorded in the account of the annals of Sovereign Dawiḏ.
{27:25} And Azmaweth son of Aḏi’ĕl was over the sovereign’s treasuries. And Yehonathan son of Uzziyahu was over the storehouses in the field, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the watchtowers.

{27:32} Also Yehonathan, Dawiḏ’s uncle, was a counsellor, a wise man and a scribe. And Yeḥi’ĕl son of Ḥaḵmoni was with the sovereign’s sons.
{27:33} And Aḥithophel was the sovereign’s counsellor, and Ḥushai the Arkite was the sovereign’s companion.
{27:34} And after Aḥithophel was Yehoyaḏa son of Benayahu, then Eḇyathar. And the chief of the sovereign’s army was Yo’aḇ.
{28:1} And Dawiḏ assembled at Yerushalayim all the rulers of Yisra’ĕl: the rulers of the tribes and the commanders of the divisions who served the sovereign, the commanders over thousands and commanders over hundreds, and the heads over all the property and possessions of the sovereign and of his sons, with the officials, the mighty men, and all the mighty brave men.
{28:2} Then Sovereign Dawiḏ rose to his feet and said, “Hear me, my brothers and my people: I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of יהוה, and for the footstool of our Elohim, and had made preparations to build it.
{28:3} “But Elohim said to me, ‘You do not build a house for My Name, because you have been a man of battle and have shed blood.’
{28:4} “Yet יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl chose me above all the house of my father to be sovereign over Yisra’ĕl forever, for He has chosen Yehuḏah to be the ruler. And of the house of Yehuḏah, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father, He was pleased with me to make me reign over all Yisra’ĕl.
{28:5} “And of all my sons – for יהוה has given me many sons – He has chosen my son Shelomoh to sit on the throne of the reign of יהוה over Yisra’ĕl,
{28:6} and said to me, ‘Shelomoh your son is the one to build My house and My courtyards, for I have chosen him to be My son, and I Myself am a Father to him.
{28:7} And I shall establish his reign forever, if he is strong to do My commands and My right-rulings, as it is this day.’
{28:8} “And now, before the eyes of all Yisra’ĕl, the assembly of יהוה, and in the hearing of our Elohim, guard and seek all the commands of יהוה your Elohim, so that you possess this good land, and leave it as an inheritance for your children after you forever.
{28:9} “As for you, my son Shelomoh, know the Elohim of your father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a pleasing life, for יהוה searches all hearts and understands all the intent of the thoughts. If you do seek Him, He is found by you; but if you forsake Him, He rejects you forever.
{28:10} “See, now, for יהוה has chosen you to build a house for the set-apart place. Be strong, and do it.”
{28:11} And Dawiḏ gave his son Shelomoh the plans for the porch, and its houses, and its treasuries, and its upper rooms, and its inner rooms, and the place of atonement;
{28:12} and the plans for all that he had by the Spirit, of the courtyards of the House of יהוה, and of all the rooms all around, and of the treasuries of the House of Elohim, and of the treasuries for the set-apart gifts;
{28:13} and for the divisions of the priests and the Lĕwites, and for all the work of the service of the House of יהוה, and for all the vessels of service in the House of יהוה;
{28:14} even gold by weight for utensils of gold, for all utensils used in every kind of service; for silver for all utensils of silver by weight, for all utensils used in every kind of service;
{28:15} and by weight for the lampstands of gold, and their lamps of gold, by weight for each lampstand and its lamps; and for the lampstands of silver by weight, for the lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand;
{28:16} and by weight gold for the tables of the showbread, for each table, and silver for the tables of silver;
{28:17} and clean gold for the forks, and the basins, and the jars of clean gold, and the golden bowls, by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls, silver by weight for every bowl;
{28:18} and refined gold by weight for the slaughter-place of incense, and for the pattern of the chariot of the gold keruḥim, spreading out their wings and covering over the ark of the covenant of יהוה.
{28:19} “יהוה made me understand all this in writing, by His hand upon me, all the works of these plans.”
{28:20} And Dawiḏ said to his son Shelomoh, “Be strong and courageous, and do it. Do not fear nor be afraid, for יהוה Elohim, my Elohim, is with you. He shall not leave you nor forsake you, until you have completed all the work for the service of the House of יהוה.
{28:21} “And see, the divisions of the priests and the Lĕwites for all the service of the House of Elohim, and every volunteer of any skill is with you in all work, for every kind of service. And the rulers and all the people are entirely at your command.”
{29:1} And Dawiḏ the sovereign said to all the assembly, “My son Shelomoh, the one whom Elohim has chosen, is young and tender. And the work is great, because the palace is not for man but for יהוה Elohim.
{29:2} “And with all my power I have prepared for the House of my Elohim: the gold for the gold, and the silver for the silver, and the bronze for the bronze, the iron for the iron, and the wood for the wood, shoham stones, and settings, and fair stones of various colours, and all kinds of precious stones, and marble slabs – in large quantities.
{29:3} “And also, because I delighted in the House of my Elohim, I have treasure of gold and silver; I give for the House of my Elohim even more than all that I have prepared for the Set-apart House:
{29:4} three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses;
{29:5} the gold for the gold and the silver for the silver, and for all kinds of work to be done by the hands of craftsmen. Who then is moved to fill his hand today for יהוה?”
{29:6} And the leaders of the fathers’ houses, and the leaders of the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, and the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with the heads over the sovereign’s work, volunteered
{29:7} and gave for the work of the House of Elohim five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, and ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
{29:8} And those with whom were found precious stones gave them to the treasury of the House of יהוה, into the hand of Yeḥi’ĕl the Gĕrshonite.
{29:9} And the people rejoiced, for they had given voluntarily, because with a perfect heart they had given voluntarily to יהוה. And Dawiḏ the sovereign also rejoiced greatly.
{29:10} And Dawiḏ blessed יהוה before all the assembly. And Dawiḏ said, “Blessed are You, יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, our Father, forever and ever.
{29:11} “Yours, O יהוה, is the greatness, the power and the comeliness, the pre-eminence and the excellency, because of all that is in the heavens and in the earth. Yours is the reign, O יהוה, and You are exalted as head above all.
{29:12} “And the riches and the esteem come from Your presence, and You rule over all. And in Your hand is power and might, and in Your hand to make great and to give strength to all.
{29:13} “And now, our Elohim, we thank You and praise Your comely Name.
{29:14} “But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give so voluntarily as this? For all comes from You, and we have given to You out of Your hand.
{29:15} “For we are sojourners and pilgrims before You, as were all our fathers; our days on earth are as a shadow, and without permanence.
{29:16} “O יהוה our Elohim, all this store that we have prepared to build You a house for Your set-apart Name is from Your hand, and all is of You.
{29:17} “And I know, my Elohim, that You are trying the heart and desire uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have voluntarily given all these. And now with joy I have seen Your people, who are present here to give voluntarily to You.
{29:18} “O יהוה Elohim of Aḇraham, Yitsḥaq, and Yisra’ĕl, our fathers, guard this forever in the intent of the thoughts of the heart of Your people, and prepare their heart toward You.
{29:19} “And give my son Shelomoh a perfect heart to guard Your commands and Your witnesses and Your laws, to do all, and to build the palace for which I have prepared.”
{29:20} And Dawiḏ said to all the assembly, “Now bless יהוה your Elohim.” And all the assembly blessed יהוה Elohim of their fathers, and bowed their heads and did obeisance to יהוה and the sovereign.
{29:21} And they slaughtered slaughterings to יהוה and offered ascending offerings to יהוה on the next day: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and slaughterings in large numbers for all Yisra’ĕl.
{29:22} And they ate and drank before יהוה with great joy on that day. And they set up Shelomoh son of Dawiḏ to reign the second time, and anointed him before יהוה to be leader, and Tsaḏoq to be priest.
{29:23} And Shelomoh sat on the throne of יהוה as sovereign instead of Dawiḏ his father, and prospered; and all Yisra’ĕl obeyed him.
{29:24} And all the rulers and the mighty men, and also all the sons of Sovereign Dawiḏ, submitted themselves to Shelomoh the sovereign.
{29:25} And יהוה exalted Shelomoh exceedingly in the eyes of all Yisra’ĕl, and put upon him such royal splendour as had not been on any sovereign before him in Yisra’ĕl.
{29:26} Thus Dawiḏ son of Yishai reigned over all Yisra’ĕl.
{29:27} And the days that he reigned over Yisra’ĕl was forty years. He reigned seven years in Ḥeḇron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Yerushalayim.
{29:28} And he died in a good old age, satisfied with days, riches and esteem. And Shelomoh his son reigned in his place.
{29:29} And the acts of Sovereign Dawiḏ, first and last, see, they are written in the book of Shemu’ĕl the seer, in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gaḏ the seer,
{29:30} with all his reign and his might, and the times that passed over him, and over Yisra’ĕl, and over all the reigns of the lands.
