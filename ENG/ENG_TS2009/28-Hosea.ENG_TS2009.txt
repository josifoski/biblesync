{1:1} The word of יהוה that came to Hoshĕa son of Be’ĕri, in the days of Uzziyah, Yotham, Aḥaz, and Yeḥizqiyah, sovereigns of Yehuḏah, and in the days of Yaroḇ‛am son of Yo’ash, sovereign of Yisra’ĕl.
{1:2} The beginning of the word of יהוה with Hoshĕa. And יהוה said to Hoshĕa, “Go, take yourself a woman of whoring and children of whoring, for the land has utterly whored away from יהוה.”
{1:3} So he went and took Gomer, daughter of Diḇlayim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
{1:4} And יהוה said to him, “Call his name Yizre‛ĕl, for in a little while I shall revenge the bloodshed of Yizre‛ĕl on the house of Yĕhu, and put an end to the reign of the house of Yisra’ĕl.
{1:5} “And it shall be in that day that I shall break the bow of Yisra’ĕl in the Valley of Yizre‛ĕl.”
{1:6} And she conceived again and bore a daughter. And He said to him, “Call her name Lo-Ruḥamah, for no longer do I have compassion on the house of Yisra’ĕl so as to forgive them at all.
{1:7} “But I shall have compassion on the house of Yehuḏah and save them by יהוה their Elohim, and not save them by bow or by sword or battle, by horses or horsemen.”
{1:8} And she weaned Lo-Ruḥamah, and conceived and bore a son,
{1:9} then He said, “Call his name Lo-Ammi, for you are not My people, and I am not for you.
{1:10} “Yet the number of the children of Yisra’ĕl shall be as the sand of the sea, which is not measured nor counted. And it shall be in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,’ they shall be called, ‘You are the sons of the living Ěl.’
{1:11} “And the children of Yehuḏah and the children of Yisra’ĕl shall be gathered together, and appoint for themselves one head, and shall come up out of the earth, for great is the day of Yizre‛ĕl!
{2:1} “Say to your brothers, ‘O my people,’ and to your sisters, ‘O, compassioned one.’
{2:2} “Strive with your mother, strive, for she is not My wife, nor am I her Husband! Let her put away her whorings from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts,
{2:3} lest I strip her naked, and shall set her up as on the day she was born, and shall make her like a wilderness, and shall set her like a dry land, and shall put her to death with thirst.
{2:4} “And I shall not have compassion on her children, for they are the children of whorings.
{2:5} “For their mother has whored, she who conceived them has acted shamelessly. For she said, ‘I go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.’
{2:6} “Therefore, see, I am hedging up your way with thorns, and I shall wall her in, so that she does not find her paths.
{2:7} “And she shall pursue her lovers but not overtake them, and shall seek them but not find them. Then she shall say, ‘Let me go and return to my first husband, for then it was better for me than now.’
{2:8} “And she did not acknowledge that I gave her grain, and new wine, and oil, and increased her silver and gold which they prepared for Ba‛al.
{2:9} “Therefore I shall turn back and shall take my grain in its time and My new wine in its appointed time, and I shall take away My wool and My linen covering her nakedness.
{2:10} “And now I shall uncover her shame before the eyes of her lovers, and no one shall deliver her from My hand.
{2:11} “And I shall cause all her rejoicing, her festivals, her New Moons, and her Sabbaths, even all her appointed times, to cease,
{2:12} and lay waste her vines and her fig trees, of which she has said, ‘these are my harlot-fees that my lovers have given me.’ And I shall make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
{2:13} “And I shall punish her for the days of the Ba‛als to which she burned incense and adorned herself with her rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, and forgot Me,” declares יהוה.
{2:14} “Therefore, see, I am alluring her, and shall lead her into the wilderness, and shall speak to her heart,
{2:15} and give to her vineyards from there, and the Valley of Aḵor as a door of expectation. And there she shall respond as in the days of her youth, as in the day when she came up from the land of Mitsrayim.
{2:16} “And it shall be, in that day,” declares יהוה, “that you call Me ‘My Husband,’ and no longer call Me ‘My Ba‛al.’
{2:17} “And I shall remove the names of the Ba‛als from her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.
{2:18} “And in that day I shall make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and with the creeping creatures of the ground, when bow, and sword, and battle I break from the earth. And I shall make them lie down in safety.
{2:19} “And I shall take you as a bride unto Me forever, and take you as a bride unto Me in righteousness, and in right-ruling, and loving-commitment and compassion.
{2:20} “And I shall take you as a bride unto Me in trustworthiness, and you shall know יהוה.
{2:21} “And it shall be in that day that I answer,” declares יהוה, “that I answer the heavens, and they answer the earth,
{2:22} and the earth answer the grain and the new wine and the oil, and they answer Yizre‛ĕl.
{2:23} “And I shall sow her for Myself in the earth, and I shall have compassion on her who had not obtained compassion. And I shall say to those who were not My people, ‘You are My people,’ while they say, ‘My Elohim!’”
{3:1} Then יהוה said to me, “Go again, love a woman loved by a friend, and an adulteress, according to the love of יהוה for the children of Yisra’ĕl, though they are turning to other mighty ones and love their raisin cakes.”
{3:2} So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver, and one and one-half ḥomers of barley.
{3:3} And I said to her, “You are to remain with me many days, you are not to whore, nor become any man’s, and so I shall also be towards you.”
{3:4} For many days the children of Yisra’ĕl are to remain without sovereign and without prince, and without slaughtering, and without pillar, and without shoulder garment or house idols.
{3:5} Afterward the children of Yisra’ĕl shall return, and seek יהוה their Elohim, and Dawiḏ their sovereign, and fear יהוה and His goodness, in the latter days.
{4:1} Hear the word of יהוה, you children of Yisra’ĕl, for יהוה has a case against the inhabitants of the land: “For there is no truth or loving-commitment or knowledge of Elohim in the land.
{4:2} “Swearing, and lying, and murdering, and stealing, and committing adultery have increased. And bloodshed follows bloodshed.
{4:3} “Therefore the land mourns, and everyone living there languishes, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens. And the fish of the sea are taken away.
{4:4} “However, let no one strive or reprove another, for your people are like those striving with a priest.
{4:5} “And you shall stumble in the day, and the prophet shall also stumble with you in the night. And I shall make your mother perish.
{4:6} “My people have perished for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being priest for Me. Since you have forgotten the Torah of your Elohim, I also forget your children.
{4:7} “As they were increased, so they sinned against Me. My esteem they have changed into shame.
{4:8} “They eat the sin of My people, and lift up their desire to their crookedness.
{4:9} “And it shall be: like people, like priest. And I shall punish them for their ways, and reward them for their deeds.
{4:10} “And they shall eat but not be satisfied, they shall whore but not increase, for they have stopped obeying יהוה.
{4:11} “Whoring, and wine, and new wine enslave the heart.
{4:12} “My people ask from their Wood, and their Staff declares to them. For a spirit of whorings has led them astray, and they went whoring from under their Elohim.
{4:13} “They slaughter on the mountaintops, and burn incense on the hills, under oak and poplars and terebinth, because its shade is good. Therefore your daughters commit whoring, and your brides commit adultery.
{4:14} “I would not punish your daughters when they commit whoring, nor your brides when they commit adultery, for the men themselves go aside with whores, and slaughter with cult prostitutes – a people that do not understand are thrust down!
{4:15} “Though you are a whore, Yisra’ĕl, let not Yehuḏah become guilty. Do not come up to Gilgal, nor go up to Bĕyth Awen, nor swear an oath, saying, ‘As יהוה lives!’
{4:16} “For Yisra’ĕl is stubborn, like a stubborn calf. Would יהוה now feed them like a lamb in a broad place?
{4:17} “Ephrayim is joined to idols, let him alone.
{4:18} “Their drink is sour, they have whored continually. Her rulers wildly loved shame.
{4:19} “A wind has bound her up in its wings, and they are ashamed because of their slaughterings.
{5:1} “Hear this, O priests! And listen, O house of Yisra’ĕl! Give ear, O house of the sovereign! For the judgment is for you, for you have been a snare to Mitspah and a net spread on Taḇor.
{5:2} “And revolters have gone deep in slaying, and I reprove them all.
{5:3} “I have known Ephrayim, and Yisra’ĕl has not been hidden from Me. For now, O Ephrayim, you have whored, Yisra’ĕl is defiled.
{5:4} “Their deeds do not allow them to turn back to their Elohim, for the spirit of whorings is among them, and they do not know יהוה.
{5:5} “And the Excellency of Yisra’ĕl shall witness to his face, and Yisra’ĕl and Ephrayim stumble in their crookedness. Yehuḏah shall also stumble with them.
{5:6} “With their flocks and herds they go to seek יהוה, but do not find Him – He has withdrawn from them.
{5:7} “They have acted treacherously against יהוה, for they have brought forth strange children. Now a new moon shall devour them with their portions.
{5:8} “Blow a shophar in Gib‛ah, the trumpet in Ramah! Shout, O Bĕyth Awen! Behind you, O Binyamin!
{5:9} “Ephrayim is laid waste in the day of rebuke. Among the tribes of Yisra’ĕl I shall make known what is certain.
{5:10} “The chiefs of Yehuḏah shall be like those who remove a border – on them I pour out my wrath like water.
{5:11} “Ephrayim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, because he walked after the command when it pleased him.
{5:12} “So I am to Ephrayim like a moth, and to the house of Yehuḏah like rottenness.
{5:13} “When Ephrayim saw his sickness, and Yehuḏah saw his wound, then Ephrayim went to Ashshur and sent to Sovereign Yarĕḇ. But he is unable to heal you, or to remove the wound from you.
{5:14} “For I am like a lion to Ephrayim, and like a young lion to the house of Yehuḏah. I Myself tear them and go, I take them away, and there is no one to deliver.
{5:15} “I shall go, I shall return to My place, until they confess their guilt and seek My face, in their distress diligently search for Me, and say,
{6:1} ‘Come, and let us turn back to יהוה. For He has torn but He does heal us, He has stricken but He binds us up.
{6:2} After two days He shall revive us, on the third day He shall raise us up, so that we live before Him.
{6:3} So let us know, let us pursue to know יהוה. His going forth is as certain as the morning. And He comes to us like the rain, like the latter rain watering the earth.’
{6:4} “Ephrayim, what would I do with you? Yehuḏah, what would I do with you? For your loving-commitment is like a morning cloud, and like the early dew it goes away.
{6:5} “Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets, I have killed them by the words of My mouth. And my right-rulings break forth as the light.
{6:6} “For I delight in loving-commitment and not slaughtering, and in the knowledge of Elohim more than ascending offerings.
{6:7} “But like Aḏam they transgressed the covenant. There they acted treacherously against Me.
{6:8} “Gil‛aḏ is a city of workers of wickedness – tracked up with blood.
{6:9} “And as bands of robbers lie in wait for a man, so the company of priests murder on the way to Sheḵem, for they have done wickedness.
{6:10} “I have seen a horrible matter in the house of Yisra’ĕl: the whoring of Ephrayim is there, Yisra’ĕl is defiled.
{6:11} “Also, a harvest is appointed for you, O Yehuḏah, when I turn back the captivity of My people.
{7:1} “Whenever I would heal Yisra’ĕl, then the crookedness of Ephrayim is uncovered, and the evil deeds of Shomeron. For they have wrought falsehood, and a thief comes in, a band of robbers raids outside.
{7:2} “And they do not say to their hearts that I remember all their evil. Now their own deeds have surrounded them, they have been before Me.
{7:3} “With their evil they make a sovereign glad, and rulers with their lies.
{7:4} “All of them are adulterers, as an oven heated by a baker, who ceases stirring the fire after kneading the dough, until it is leavened.
{7:5} “In the day of our sovereign rulers became sick, inflamed with wine. He extended his hand with scoffers.
{7:6} “For they have drawn near, their heart is like an oven. While they lie in wait all the night their baker sleeps. In the morning it burns like a flaming fire.
{7:7} “All of them are as hot as an oven, and they consumed their rulers. All their sovereigns have fallen – not one among them calls on Me.
{7:8} “Ephrayim mixes himself among the peoples, Ephrayim has become a cake unturned.
{7:9} “Strangers have devoured his strength, but he does not know it. Grey hairs are also sprinkled on him, and he does not know it.
{7:10} “And the Excellency of Yisra’ĕl did witness to his face, but they did not return to יהוה their Elohim, nor did they seek Him for all this.
{7:11} “And Ephrayim has become a simple dove without heart, they have called on Mitsrayim, they have gone to Ashshur.
{7:12} “When they go I spread My net over them, I bring them down like the birds of the heavens, I chastise them as their congregation has heard.
{7:13} “Woe to them, for they have strayed from Me! Destruction to them, because they have transgressed against Me! And I Myself have ransomed them, yet they have spoken falsehoods against Me,
{7:14} and did not cry out to Me with their heart when they wailed upon their beds. For grain and new wine they assemble themselves; they turn away from Me.
{7:15} “And I instructed, I strengthened their arms, but they plot evil against Me.
{7:16} “They return but not above. They have been like a slack bow. Their rulers fall by the sword for the cursings of their tongue. This is their scorn in the land of Mitsrayim.
{8:1} “Put a shophar to your mouth, like an eagle against the House of יהוה, because they have transgressed My covenant, and they have rebelled against My Torah.
{8:2} “They cry out to Me, ‘My Elohim – we, Yisra’ĕl, know You!’
{8:3} “Yisra’ĕl has rejected what is good, an enemy pursues him.
{8:4} “They have made sovereigns, but not from Me. They have made rulers, but I have not known. From their silver and gold they made idols for themselves, so that they are cut off.
{8:5} “O Shomeron, your calf has been cast off! My wrath has burned against them. How long shall they be incapable of innocence?
{8:6} “For from Yisra’ĕl is even this: a workman made it, and it is not Elohim! For the calf of Shomeron is splinters!
{8:7} “For they sow the wind, and reap the whirlwind. The stalk has no bud, it yields no grain. If it does yield, strangers swallow it up.
{8:8} “Yisra’ĕl has been swallowed up. They have now become among the nations as a vessel in which is no pleasure.
{8:9} “For they themselves have gone up to Ashshur. A wild donkey alone by itself is Ephrayim, they have hired lovers.
{8:10} “Also, although they sold themselves among the nations, this time I shall gather them, when they have suffered for a while from the burden of a sovereign, of rulers.
{8:11} “Since Ephrayim has made many slaughter-places for sin, they have been slaughter-places for sinning to him.
{8:12} “I have written for him numerous matters of My Torah – they were regarded as strange.
{8:13} “As for My slaughterings: they slaughter flesh and they eat. יהוה shall not accept them. Now does He remember their crookedness and punish their sins. Let them return to Mitsrayim!
{8:14} “For Yisra’ĕl has forgotten his Maker, and has built palaces. And Yehuḏah has increased walled cities. But I shall send fire upon his cities, and it shall devour his strongholds.”
{9:1} O Yisra’ĕl, do not rejoice with exultation like the peoples, for you have whored from your Elohim. You have loved a harlot-fee at all threshing-floors.
{9:2} Threshing floor and winepress shall not feed them, and new wine shall fail in her.
{9:3} They shall not dwell in the land of יהוה, but Ephrayim shall return to Mitsrayim, and eat unclean food in Ashshur.
{9:4} They do not pour wine offerings to יהוה, nor are they pleasing to Him. Their slaughterings are like bread of mourners to them, all who eat it are defiled. For their bread is for their beings, it does not come into the House of יהוה.
{9:5} What do you do for the Day of Appointment, and in the day of the Festival of יהוה?
{9:6} For look, they shall go because of destruction – Mitsrayim gathers them up, Moph buries them, nettles possess their valuables of silver, thorns are in their tents.
{9:7} The days of punishment have come, the days of retribution have come. Yisra’ĕl knows! The prophet is a fool, the ‘man of the Spirit’ is mad, because of the greatness of your crookedness, and great is the enmity.
{9:8} Elohim’s watchman over you, Ephrayim, is the prophet, but a trapper’s snare is in all his ways. Enmity is in the House of his Elohim.
{9:9} They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gib‛ah. He remembers their crookedness, He punishes their sins.
{9:10} “I found Yisra’ĕl like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the first-fruits on the fig tree in its beginning. They themselves have gone to Ba‛al Pe‛or, and separated themselves to shame, and became as abominable as that which they loved.
{9:11} “Ephrayim is like a bird, their esteem has flown away – no birth, and none with child, and no conception!
{9:12} “Though they bring up their children, I shall make them childless, without man. For it is woe to them when I turn away from them!
{9:13} “I have seen Ephrayim, like Tsor, planted in a pleasant place. But Ephrayim shall bring out his children to the killer.”
{9:14} Give them, O יהוה – give what? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
{9:15} “All their evil is in Gilgal, for there I have hated them. Because of the evil of their deeds I drive them from My house, no more do I love them. All their rulers are rebels.
{9:16} “Ephrayim has been stricken, their root has dried up, they yield no fruit. Even if they bear children, I shall put to death the precious ones of their womb.”
{9:17} My Elohim rejects them, because they have not obeyed Him, so that they become wanderers among the nations!
{10:1} Yisra’ĕl is a degenerate vine, he brings forth fruit for himself. As his fruit increased, he increased the slaughter-places. And the better his land, the better they made the pillars.
{10:2} Their heart has been slippery, now they are guilty. He breaks down their slaughter-places, He destroys their pillars.
{10:3} For now they say, “We have no sovereign, because we did not fear יהוה. What would the sovereign do for us?”
{10:4} They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant. Therefore judgment shall spring up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.
{10:5} The inhabitants of Shomeron fear because of the calf of Bĕyth Awen. For its people shall mourn for it, as well as its priests who used to rejoice over it, because of its esteem that has departed from it.
{10:6} It is also brought to Ashshur as a present for Sovereign Yarĕḇ. Ephrayim does receive shame, and Yisra’ĕl is put to shame through his counsel.
{10:7} Shomeron is cut off, her sovereign is like a twig on the surface of the water.
{10:8} And the high places of Awen, the sin of Yisra’ĕl, shall be destroyed, thorn and thistle come up on their slaughter-places. And they shall say to the mountains, “Cover us!” and to the hills, “Fall on us!”
{10:9} “O Yisra’ĕl, you have sinned from the days of Gib‛ah. There they stood! The battle in Gib‛ah against the children of perversity did not overtake them.
{10:10} “When I desire, then I bind them. And peoples shall be gathered against them when I bind them for their double guilt.
{10:11} “And Ephrayim is a trained heifer, loving to thresh grain. But I Myself shall pass over her comely neck – I put Ephrayim to the yoke, Yehuḏah ploughs, Ya‛aqoḇ harrows for him.”
{10:12} Sow for yourselves righteousness, reap according to loving-commitment, break up your tillable ground, it is time to seek יהוה, till He comes and rainsa righteousness on you.
{10:13} You have ploughed wrongness, you have reaped unrighteousness, you have eaten the fruit of lying, because you trusted in your own way, in your many mighty men.
{10:14} And uproar shall arise among your people, and all your strongholds shall be ravaged as Shalman ravaged Bĕyth Arbĕl in the day of battle – a mother dashed in pieces on her children.
{10:15} Thus it shall be done to you, O Bĕyth Ěl, because of the evil of your wickedness. At dawn the sovereign of Yisra’ĕl is completely cut off!
{11:1} “When Yisra’ĕl was a child, I loved him, and out of Mitsrayim I called My son.
{11:2} “They called to them, so they went from their face. They slaughtered to the Ba‛als, and burned incense to carved images.
{11:3} “And I taught Ephrayim to walk, taking them by their arms, but they did not know that I healed them.
{11:4} “I drew them with ropes of man, with cords of love, and I was to them as those who take the yoke from their neck. And I bent down, fed them.
{11:5} “No, let him return to the land of Mitsrayim, and let Ashshur be his sovereign, because they refused to repent!
{11:6} “And the sword shall whirl in his cities, and it shall demolish his gate bars, and consume, because of their own counsels.
{11:7} “My people are bent towards backsliding from Me. Though they call to the One Above, none of them exalt Him.
{11:8} “How could I give you up, Ephrayim? How could I hand you over, Yisra’ĕl? How could I make you like Aḏmah? How could I set you like Tseḇoyim? My heart turns within Me, all My compassion is kindled.
{11:9} “I shall not let the heat of My wrath burn, I shall not turn to destroy Ephrayim. For I am Ěl, and not man, the Set-apart One in your midst, and I shall not come in enmity.
{11:10} “Let them follow יהוה. Like a lion He roars. When He roars, then sons shall tremble from the west.
{11:11} “They shall tremble like a bird from Mitsrayim, and like a dove from the land of Ashshur. And I shall let them dwell in their own houses,” declares יהוה.
{11:12} “Ephrayim has surrounded Me with lying, and the house of Yisra’ĕl with deceit. But Yehuḏah is still wandering with Ěl, and is true to the Set-apart One.”
{12:1} Ephrayim is feeding on wind, and pursuing an east wind. All the day he increases falsehood and ruin. And they make a covenant with Ashshur, and oil is sent to Mitsrayim.
{12:2} And יהוה has a controversy with Yehuḏah, to punish Ya‛aqoḇ according to his ways, to repay him according to his deeds.
{12:3} He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and in his strength he strove with Elohim.
{12:4} He strove with the Messenger and overcame, he wept and sought His favour. He found Him in Bĕyth Ěl, and there He spoke to us –
{12:5} even יהוה Elohim of hosts, יהוה is His remembrance.
{12:6} Therefore, return to your Elohim. Guard loving-commitment and right-ruling, and wait on your Elohim continually.
{12:7} A merchant! In his hand are scales of deceit, he loved to oppress.
{12:8} And Ephrayim says, “Indeed, I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself. In all my labours they shall find in me no crookedness that is sin.”
{12:9} “But I am יהוה your Elohim since the land of Mitsrayim, again I shall make you dwell in tents as in the days of the appointed time.
{12:10} “And I have spoken to the prophets, and have increased visions. And through the prophets I gave parables.”
{12:11} Is Gil‛aḏ wicked? Certainly, they have been false! In Gilgal they have slaughtered bulls. Also their slaughter-places are as heaps on a ploughed field.
{12:12} And when Ya‛aqoḇ fled to the country of Aram, Yisra’ĕl served for a wife, and for a wife he kept watch.
{12:13} And by a prophet יהוה brought Yisra’ĕl out of Mitsrayim, and by a prophet he was watched over.
{12:14} Ephrayim has provoked most bitterly. So his Master left his blood-guilt on him, and repaid him for his reproach.
{13:1} When Ephrayim spoke there was trembling, he was lifted up in Yisra’ĕl. But through Ba‛al he became guilty, and he died.
{13:2} And now they sin more and more, and make for themselves moulded images from their silver, idols according to their skill, all of them the work of craftsmen. They say of them, “Let the men who slaughter kiss the calves!”
{13:3} Therefore they shall be like a morning cloud, and like dew that goes away early, like chaff blown off from a threshing-floor, and like smoke from a window.
{13:4} “But I am יהוה your Elohim since the land of Mitsrayim, and an Elohim besides Me you shall not know, for there is no Saviour besides Me.
{13:5} “I knew you in the wilderness, in the land of drought.
{13:6} “When they were fed they were satisfied. They were satisfied and their heart was exalted, therefore they forgot Me.
{13:7} “So I am become like a lion to them, like a leopard I watch by the way,
{13:8} like a bear robbed of her young I attack them and rip open the enclosure of their heart. And there I devour them like a lion, a wild beast tear them apart.
{13:9} “You have destroyed yourself, O Yisra’ĕl, but your help is in Me.
{13:10} “Where is your sovereign now to save you in all your cities, and your rulers of whom you said, ‘Give me a sovereign and rulers’?
{13:11} “I gave you a sovereign in My displeasure, but I took him away in My wrath.
{13:12} “The crookedness of Ephrayim is bound up, his sin is hidden.
{13:13} “Pains of a woman in labour shall come upon him. He is not a wise son, for it is not the time that he should delay at the breaking forth of children.
{13:14} “From the power of She’ol I ransom them, from death I redeem them. Where is your plague, O Death? Where is your destruction, O She’ol? Repentance is hidden from My eyes.
{13:15} “Though he bears fruit among his brothers, an east wind comes, a wind from יהוה comes up from the wilderness, and it dries up his fountain, and his spring becomes dry – it plunders a treasure of all desirable objects.
{13:16} “Shomeron is held guilty, for she has rebelled against her Elohim – they fall by the sword, their infants are dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women ripped open.”
{14:1} O Yisra’ĕl, return to יהוה your Elohim, for you have stumbled by your crookedness.
{14:2} Take words with you, and return to יהוה. Say to Him, “Take away all crookedness, and accept what is good, and we render the bulls of our lips.
{14:3} “Ashshur does not save us. We do not ride on horses, nor ever again do we say to the work of our hands, ‘Our mighty ones.’ For the fatherless finds compassion in You.”
{14:4} “I shall heal their backsliding, I shall love them spontaneously, for My displeasure has turned away from him.
{14:5} “I shall be like the dew to Yisra’ĕl. He shall blossom like the lily, and strike out his roots like Leḇanon.
{14:6} “His branches shall spread, and his splendour shall be like an olive tree, and his fragrance like Leḇanon.
{14:7} “Those who dwell under his shadow shall return. They shall revive like grain, and blossom like the vine, and become as fragrant as the wine of Leḇanon.
{14:8} “What more has Ephrayim to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after him. I am like a green cypress tree, your fruit comes from Me.”
{14:9} Who is wise and understands these words, discerning and knows them? For the ways of יהוה are straight, and the righteous walk in them, but the transgressors stumble in them.
