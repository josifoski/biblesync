{1:1} Blessed is the man who shall not walk in the counsel of the wrong, And shall not stand in the path of sinners, And shall not sit in the seat of scoffers,
{1:2} But his delight is in the Torah of יהוה, And he meditates in His Torah day and night.
{1:3} For he shall be as a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That yields its fruit in its season, And whose leaf does not wither, And whatever he does prospers.
{1:4} The wrong are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind blows away.
{1:5} Therefore the wrong shall not rise in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
{1:6} For יהוה knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the wrong comes to naught.
{2:1} Why do the nations rage, And the peoples meditate emptiness?
{2:2} The sovereigns of the earth take their stand, And the rulers take counsel together, Against יהוה and against His Messiah, and say,
{2:3} Let us tear apart Their bonds, And throw away Their ropes from us.
{2:4} He who is sitting in the heavens laughs, יהוה mocks at them.
{2:5} Then He speaks to them in His wrath, And troubles them in His rage, saying,
{2:6} But I, I have set My Sovereign on Tsiyon, My set-apart mountain.
{2:7} “I inscribe for a law: יהוה has said to Me, ‘You are My Son, Today I have brought You forth.
{2:8} Ask of Me, and I make the nations Your inheritance, And the ends of the earth Your possession.
{2:9} Break them with a rod of iron, Dash them to pieces like a potter’s vessel.’”
{2:10} And now, be wise, O sovereigns; Be instructed, you rulers of the earth.
{2:11} Serve יהוה with fear, And rejoice with trembling.
{2:12} Kiss the Chosen, lest He be enraged, And you perish in the way, For soon His wrath is to be kindled. Blessed are all those taking refuge in Him.
{3:1} O יהוה, how my adversaries have increased! Many rising up against me.
{3:2} Many are saying of me, “There is no deliverance for him in Elohim.” Selah.
{3:3} But You, O יהוה, are a shield for me, My esteem, and the One lifting up my head.
{3:4} I cried to יהוה with my voice, And He heard me from His set-apart mountain. Selah.
{3:5} I, I laid down and slept; I awoke, for יהוה sustained me.
{3:6} I am not afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me all around.
{3:7} Arise, O יהוה; Save me, O my Elohim! Because You have stricken all my enemies on the cheek; You have broken the teeth of the wrong.
{3:8} Deliverance belongs to יהוה. Your blessing is on Your people. Selah.
{4:1} Answer me when I call, O Elohim of my righteousness! You gave relief to me when I was in distress; Show favour to me, and hear my prayer.
{4:2} Till when, O you sons of men, Would you turn my esteem to shame, Would you love emptiness, seek falsehood? Selah.
{4:3} But know that יהוה has separated a lovingly-committed one for Himself; יהוה hears when I call to Him.
{4:4} Tremble, and do not sin. Speak within your heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.
{4:5} Slaughter slaughterings of righteousness, And trust in יהוה.
{4:6} Many are saying, “Who would show us good?” יהוה, lift up the light of Your face upon us.
{4:7} You have put more gladness in my heart, Than in the season that their grain and wine increased.
{4:8} I lie down in peace altogether, and sleep; For You alone, O יהוה, make me dwell in safety.
{5:1} Give ear to my words, O יהוה, Consider my meditation.
{5:2} Attend to the voice of my cry, My Sovereign and my Elohim, For unto You I pray.
{5:3} O יהוה, in the morning You hear my voice; I present myself to You in the morning, And I look up.
{5:4} For You are not an Ěl taking delight in wrong, Nor does evil dwell with You.
{5:5} The boasters do not stand before Your eyes; You hate all workers of wickedness.
{5:6} You destroy those speaking falsehood; יהוה loathes a man of blood and deceit.
{5:7} But I, I enter Your house In the greatness of Your loving-commitment; I bow myself toward Your set-apart Hĕḵal in Your fear.
{5:8} O יהוה, lead me in Your righteousness because of those watching me; Make Your way straight before my face.
{5:9} For there is no stability in their mouth; Their inward part is destruction; Their throat is an open burial-site; They flatter with their tongue.
{5:10} Declare them guilty, O Elohim! Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them away for their many transgressions, Because they have rebelled against You.
{5:11} But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; Let them ever shout for joy, because You shelter them; And let those who love Your Name exult in You.
{5:12} For You bless the righteous, O יהוה; You surround him with favour as with a shield.
{6:1} O יהוה, do not rebuke me in Your displeasure, Nor discipline me in Your wrath.
{6:2} Show favour to me, O יהוה, for I am fading away; O יהוה, heal me, for my bones have been troubled.
{6:3} And my being has been greatly troubled; And You, O יהוה – till when?
{6:4} Return, O יהוה, rescue my life! Oh, save me for Your loving-commitment’ sake!
{6:5} For in death there is no remembrance of You; Who gives You thanks in She’ol?
{6:6} I have grown weary with my groaning; Every night I flood my bed; I drench my couch with my tears.
{6:7} My eye has grown dim because of grief; It grows old because of all my adversaries.
{6:8} Depart from me, all you workers of wickedness; For יהוה has heard the voice of my weeping.
{6:9} יהוה has heard my pleading; יהוה receives my prayer.
{6:10} Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled; They turn back suddenly, ashamed.
{7:1} O יהוה my Elohim, in You I have taken refuge; Save me from all my pursuers; And deliver me,
{7:2} Lest they tear at my throat like a lion, Rending in pieces, with no one to deliver.
{7:3} O יהוה my Elohim, if I have done this: If there is unrighteousness in my hands,
{7:4} If I have done evil to him who was at peace with me, Or have plundered my enemy without cause,
{7:5} Let the enemy pursue me and overtake my being, And trample my life to the ground, And lay my esteem in the dust. Selah.
{7:6} Arise, O יהוה, in Your displeasure; Lift Yourself up against the rage of my adversaries, And awake for me! You shall command judgment!
{7:7} And let the congregation of the peoples gather about You; And over them return on high.
{7:8} יהוה judges the peoples; Judge me, O יהוה, according to my righteousness, And according to my integrity within me.
{7:9} Please let the evil of the wrong be ended, And establish the righteous; For the righteous Elohim is a trier of hearts and kidneys.
{7:10} My shield is upon Elohim, Who saves the upright in heart.
{7:11} Elohim is a righteous judge. And Ěl is enraged every day,
{7:12} If one does not repent! He sharpens His sword, He bends His bow and makes it ready,
{7:13} And He has prepared for Himself instruments of death, He makes His arrows hot for pursuers.
{7:14} See, he who is bound with wickedness, And has conceived trouble and brought forth falsehood,
{7:15} He has made a pit and dug it out, And falls into the ditch he made!
{7:16} His trouble turns back upon his own head, And his wrongdoing comes down on the top of his head.
{7:17} I give thanks to יהוה according to His righteousness, And praise the Name of יהוה Most High.
{8:1} O יהוה, our Master, how excellent is Your Name in all the earth, You who set Your splendour above the heavens!
{8:2} Out of the mouth of babes and infants You have founded strength, Because of Your adversaries, To put an end to enemy and avenger.
{8:3} For I see Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have established.
{8:4} What is man that You remember him? And the son of man that You visit him?
{8:5} Yet You have made him a little less than Elohim, And have crowned him with esteem and splendour.
{8:6} You made him rule over the works of Your hands; You have put all under his feet,
{8:7} All sheep and oxen, And also the beasts of the field,
{8:8} The birds of the heavens, And the fish of the sea, Passing through the paths of the seas.
{8:9} O יהוה, our Master, How excellent is Your Name in all the earth!
{9:1} Aleph I praise You, O יהוה, with all my heart; I declare all Your wonders.
{9:2} I rejoice and exult in You; I sing praise to Your Name, O Most High.
{9:3} Bĕt When my enemies turn back, They stumble and perish before You.
{9:4} For You executed my right and my cause, You sat on the throne judging in righteousness.
{9:5} Gimel You have rebuked the nations, You have destroyed the wrong, You have wiped out their name forever and ever.
{9:6} Hĕ The enemy is no more – ruins everlasting! And You have uprooted the cities; Even their remembrance has perished.
{9:7} But יהוה abides forever, He is preparing His throne for judgment.
{9:8} And He judges the world in righteousness, He judges the peoples in straightness.
{9:9} Waw And יהוה is a refuge for the crushed one, A refuge in times of distress.
{9:10} And those who know Your Name trust in You, For You have not forsaken those who seek You, O יהוה.
{9:11} Zayin Sing praises to יהוה, who dwells in Tsiyon! Declare His deeds among the peoples.
{9:12} For He remembers the seekers of bloodshed, He does not forget the cry of the afflicted.
{9:13} Ḥet Show favour to me, O יהוה! See my affliction by those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death,
{9:14} So that I declare all Your praise In the gates of the daughter of Tsiyon. I rejoice in Your deliverance.
{9:15} Tet The nations have sunk down in the pit which they made; In the net which they hid, their own foot is caught.
{9:16} יהוה has made Himself known, He has done right-ruling; The wrong is snared in the work of his own hands. Meditation. Selah.
{9:17} Yod The wrong return to She’ol, All the nations that forget Elohim.
{9:18} Kaph For the needy is not always forgotten; Neither the expectancy of the poor lost forever.
{9:19} Arise, O יהוה, Do not let man prevail; Let the nations be judged before Your face.
{9:20} Put them in fear, O יהוה, Let the nations know they are but men. Selah.
{10:1} Lamed Why do You stand afar off, O יהוה, hiding in times of distress?
{10:2} In arrogance the wrongdoer hotly pursues the poor; They are caught by the schemes which they devised.
{10:3} For the wrongdoer boasted of his cravings; And the greedy one cursed and despised יהוה.
{10:4} In the pride of his face The wrongdoer does not seek Him, In all his thoughts there is no Elohim!
{10:5} His ways are always prosperous! Your right-rulings are on high, out of his sight! He snorts at all his adversaries!
{10:6} He has said in his heart, “I shall not be moved; From generation to generation, never be in evil!”
{10:7} Pĕ His mouth is filled with cursing and deceit and oppression; Under his tongue is trouble and wickedness.
{10:8} He sits in the hiding places of the villages; In the secret places he kills the innocent; Ayin His eyes are on the lookout for the helpless.
{10:9} He lies in wait in a secret place, as a lion in his den; He lies in wait to catch the poor; He catches the poor, drawing him into his net.
{10:10} And he crouches, he lies low, And the helpless fall under his strength.
{10:11} He has said in his heart, “Ěl has forgotten, He has hidden His face, He shall never see.”
{10:12} Qoph Arise, O יהוה! O Ěl, lift up Your hand! Do not forget the lowly ones.
{10:13} Why do the wrong scorn Elohim? He has said in his heart, “It is not required.”
{10:14} Rĕsh You have seen it, for You observe trouble and grief, To repay with Your hand. The poor commits himself to You; You are the helper of the fatherless.
{10:15} Shin Break the arm of the wrong one and the evil one; Search out his wrongness that would not be found out.
{10:16} יהוה is Sovereign forever and ever; The nations shall perish from His land.
{10:17} Taw יהוה, You have heard the desire of the lowly ones; You prepare their heart; You incline Your ear,
{10:18} To defend the fatherless and the downtrodden; So that man who is of the earth no longer oppresses!
{11:1} In יהוה I have taken refuge; Why do you say to me, “Flee to your mountain like a bird”?
{11:2} For look! The wrong bend a bow, They set their arrow on the string, To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
{11:3} When the foundations are destroyed, What shall the righteous do?
{11:4} יהוה is in His set-apart Hĕḵal, The throne of יהוה is in the heavens. His eyes see, His eyelids examine the sons of men.
{11:5} יהוה tries the righteous, But His being shall hate the wrong And the one who loves violence.
{11:6} Upon the wrong He rains snares, Fire and sulphur and a scorching wind Are the portion of their cup.
{11:7} For יהוה is righteous, He has loved righteousness; The upright shall see His face.
{12:1} Save, יהוה, for the lovingly-committed one is no more! For the trustworthy have ceased from among the sons of men.
{12:2} They speak falsehood with each other; They speak with flattering lips, a double heart.
{12:3} יהוה does cut off all flattering lips, A tongue that speaks swelling words,
{12:4} Who have said, “With our tongue we do mightily; Our lips are our own; Who is master over us?”
{12:5} Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy, I now arise, says יהוה, “I set in safety – he pants for it.”
{12:6} The Words of יהוה are clean Words, Silver tried in a furnace of earth, Refined seven times.
{12:7} You guard them, O יהוה, You preserve them from this generation forever.
{12:8} The wrong walk around on every side, When worthlessness is exalted among the sons of men.
{13:1} How long would You forget me, O יהוה? Forever? How long would You hide Your face from me?
{13:2} How long would I take counsel in my being, Grief in my heart day by day? How long would my enemy be exalted over me?
{13:3} Look! Answer me, O יהוה my Elohim; Enlighten my eyes, Lest I sleep in death;
{13:4} Lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him,” Lest my adversaries rejoice when I am moved.
{13:5} But I have trusted in Your loving-commitment; My heart rejoices in Your deliverance.
{13:6} I sing to יהוה, Because He has been good to me.
{14:1} The fool has said in his heart, “There is no יהוה.” They have done corruptly, They have done an abominable deed, There is no one who does good.
{14:2} יהוה looked down from the heavens on the sons of mankind, To see if there is a wise one, seeking יהוה.
{14:3} They have all turned aside, They have together become filthy; No one is doing good, not even one.
{14:4} Have all the workers of wickedness no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And do not call on יהוה?
{14:5} There they are in great fear, For יהוה is with the generation of the righteous.
{14:6} You would put to shame the counsel of the poor, But יהוה is his refuge.
{14:7} O that the deliverance of Yisra’ĕl Would be given out of Tsiyon! When יהוה turns back the captivity of His people, Let Ya‛aqoḇ rejoice, let Yisra’ĕl be glad.
{15:1} יהוה, who does sojourn in Your Tent? Who does dwell in Your set-apart mountain?
{15:2} He who walks blamelessly, And does righteousness, And speaks the truth in his heart.
{15:3} He has not slandered with his tongue, He has not done evil to his neighbour, Nor lifted up a reproach against his friend;
{15:4} In whose eyes a reprobate one is despised, But he esteems those who fear יהוה; He who swears to his own hurt and does not change;
{15:5} He has not put out his silver at interest, And has not taken a bribe against the innocent. He who does these is never moved.
{16:1} Guard me, O Ěl, for I have taken refuge in You.
{16:2} I have said to יהוה, “You are יהוה, I have no good beside You.”
{16:3} As for the set-apart ones who are on the earth, They are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight.
{16:4} The sorrows of those who run after another one are increased; I would not pour out their drink offerings of blood, Nor take up their names on my lips.
{16:5} יהוה is the portion of my inheritance and my cup; You uphold my lot.
{16:6} Boundary lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; Indeed, a good inheritance is mine.
{16:7} I bless יהוה who has given me counsel; My kidneys also instruct me in the nights.
{16:8} I have set יהוה always before me; Because He is at my right hand I am not shaken.
{16:9} Therefore my heart was glad, and my esteem rejoices; My flesh also dwells in safety.
{16:10} For You do not leave my being in She’ol, Neither let Your Lovingly-committed One see corruption.
{16:11} You show me the path of life; In Your presence is joy to satisfaction; At Your right hand are pleasures forever.
{17:1} Hear righteousness, יהוה, Listen to my cry; Give ear to my prayer, From lips without deceit.
{17:2} Let my right-ruling go out from Your presence; Let Your eyes see what is straight.
{17:3} You have examined my heart; You have visited me in the night; You have tried me – You find I have not schemed; My mouth would not transgress.
{17:4} As for the deeds of men – By the word of Your lips, I have kept myself from the paths of the destroyer.
{17:5} My steps have held fast to Your paths, My feet have not slipped.
{17:6} I have called upon You, for You answer me, O Ěl; Incline Your ear to me, hear my speech.
{17:7} Let Your loving-commitment be distinguished, You who save by Your right hand those who take refuge From those who rise up.
{17:8} Guard me as the apple of Your eye. Hide me under the shadow of Your wings,
{17:9} From the face of the wrong who ravage me, From my deadly enemies who surround me.
{17:10} They are enclosed in their own fat, They speak proudly with their mouths,
{17:11} They have now surrounded us in our steps, They set their eyes to cast us to the ground,
{17:12} Like a lion who is eager to tear his prey, And as a young lion crouching in cover.
{17:13} Arise, O יהוה, Confront him, cause him to bend; Deliver my being from the wrong by Your sword,
{17:14} From men by Your hand, O יהוה, From men of the world whose portion is in this life, And You fill their bellies with Your treasure, They are satisfied with children, And shall leave their riches to their babes.
{17:15} As for me, let Me see Your face in righteousness; I am satisfied to see Your appearance when I awake.
{18:1} I love You, O יהוה, My strength.
{18:2} יהוה is my rock and my stronghold and my deliverer; My Ěl is my rock, I take refuge in Him; My shield and the horn of my deliverance, my high tower.
{18:3} I call upon יהוה, the One to be praised, And I am saved from my enemies.
{18:4} The cords of death surrounded me, And the floods of Beliya‛al made me afraid.
{18:5} The cords of She’ol were all around me; The snares of death were before me.
{18:6} In my distress I called upon יהוה, And to my Elohim I cried; He heard my voice from His Hĕḵal, And my cry went before Him, into His ears.
{18:7} And the earth shook and trembled; Even the foundations of the mountains were troubled And they shook, because He was wroth.
{18:8} Smoke went up from His nostrils, And consuming fire from His mouth; Coals were kindled by it.
{18:9} And He bowed the heavens and came down, And thick darkness was under His feet.
{18:10} And He rode upon a keruḇ, and flew; He flew upon the wings of the wind.
{18:11} He made darkness His covering; Around Him His booth, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
{18:12} From the brightness before Him, His thick clouds passed, hail and coals of fire.
{18:13} And יהוה thundered in the heavens, And the Most High sent forth His voice, Hail and coals of fire.
{18:14} And He sent out His arrows and scattered them, And much lightning, and confused them.
{18:15} And the channels of waters were seen, And the foundations of the world were uncovered At Your rebuke, O יהוה, At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
{18:16} He sent from above, He took me; He drew me out of many waters.
{18:17} He delivered me from my strong enemy, And from those hating me, For they were stronger than I.
{18:18} They confronted me in the day of my calamity, But יהוה was my support.
{18:19} And He brought me out into a large place; He delivered me for He delighted in me.
{18:20} יהוה rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands He repaid me.
{18:21} For I have guarded the ways of יהוה, And have not acted wrongly against my Elohim.
{18:22} For all His right-rulings are before me, And I did not turn from His laws.
{18:23} And I am perfect before Him, And I guard myself from my crookedness.
{18:24} And יהוה repays me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands before His eyes.
{18:25} With the lovingly-committed You show Yourself lovingly-committed; With the perfect one You show Yourself perfect;
{18:26} With the clean You show Yourself clean; And with the crooked You show Yourself twisted.
{18:27} For You save the afflicted people, But bring down those whose eyes are haughty.
{18:28} For You Yourself light my lamp; יהוה my Elohim makes my darkness light.
{18:29} For with You I run against a band, And with my Elohim I leap over a wall.
{18:30} The Ěl – His way is perfect; The Word of יהוה is proven; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.
{18:31} For who is Eloah, besides יהוה? And who is a rock, except our Elohim?
{18:32} It is Ěl who girds me with strength, And makes my way perfect,
{18:33} Making my feet like the feet of deer, And sets me on my high places,
{18:34} Teaching my hands for battle, So that my arms shall bend a bow of bronze.
{18:35} And You give me the shield of Your deliverance; And Your right hand supports me, And Your lowliness makes me great.
{18:36} You enlarge my step under me; And my feet shall not slip.
{18:37} I pursue my enemies and overtake them; And do not turn back till they are destroyed.
{18:38} I crush them, and they are unable to rise; They fall under my feet.
{18:39} And You gird me with strength for battle; Cause my adversaries to bow under me.
{18:40} And You have made my enemies turn their backs, As for those hating me, I cut them off.
{18:41} They cry – but no one is there to save, To יהוה – but He answers them not.
{18:42} And I beat them as dust before the wind; I empty them out like dirt in the streets.
{18:43} You deliver me from the strivings of the people, You set me at the head of the nations; A people I have not known serve me.
{18:44} As soon as they hear of me they obey me; The foreigners submit to me.
{18:45} The foreigners fade away, And come frightened from their strongholds.
{18:46} יהוה lives! And blessed is my Rock! And exalted is the Elohim of my deliverance,
{18:47} The Ěl who avenges me, And He humbles the peoples under me;
{18:48} My deliverer from my enemies. You lift me up above those who rise against me; You deliver me from a man of violence.
{18:49} Therefore I give thanks to You, O יהוה, among nations, And I sing praise to Your Name,
{18:50} Making great the deliverance of His sovereign, And showing loving-commitment to His anointed, To Dawiḏ and his seed, forever.
{19:1} The heavens are proclaiming the esteem of Ěl; And the expanse is declaring the work of His hand.
{19:2} Day to day pours forth speech, And night to night reveals knowledge.
{19:3} There is no speech, and there are no words, Their voice is not heard.
{19:4} Their line has gone out through all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them He set up a tent for the sun,
{19:5} And it is like a bridegroom coming out of his room, It rejoices like a strong man to run the path.
{19:6} Its rising is from one end of the heavens, And its circuit to the other end; And naught is hidden from its heat.
{19:7} The Torah of יהוה is perfect, bringing back the being; The witness of יהוה is trustworthy, making wise the simple;
{19:8} The orders of יהוה are straight, rejoicing the heart; The command of יהוה is clear, enlightening the eyes;
{19:9} The fear of יהוה is clean, standing forever; The right-rulings of יהוה are true, They are righteous altogether,
{19:10} More desirable than gold, Than much fine gold; And sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.
{19:11} Also, Your servant is warned by them, In guarding them there is great reward.
{19:12} Who discerns mistakes? Declare me innocent from those that are secret,
{19:13} Also keep Your servant back from presumptuous ones, Do not let them rule over me. Then shall I be perfect, and innocent of great transgression.
{19:14} Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be pleasing before You, O יהוה, my rock and my redeemer.
{20:1} יהוה does answer you in the day of distress! The Name of the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ does set you on high!
{20:2} He does send you help from the set-apart place, And does uphold you from Tsiyon!
{20:3} He does remember all your offerings, And does accept your ascending offering! Selah.
{20:4} He does give you according to your heart, And fills all your plans!
{20:5} We sing of Your deliverance, And in the Name of our Elohim we set up a banner! יהוה does fill all your requests!
{20:6} Now I know that יהוה shall save His Anointed; He answers him from His set-apart heavens With the saving might of His right hand.
{20:7} Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, But we remember the Name of יהוה our Elohim.
{20:8} They, they have bowed down and fallen; But we have risen and are established.
{20:9} Save, יהוה! Let the Sovereign answer us in the day we call.
{21:1} The sovereign rejoices in Your strength, O יהוה; And how greatly he exults in Your deliverance!
{21:2} You have given him the desire of his heart, And You have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.
{21:3} For You put before him the blessings of goodness; You set a crown of fine gold on his head.
{21:4} He asked life from You, and You gave it to him – Length of days forever and ever.
{21:5} Through Your deliverance his esteem is great; You have laid excellency and splendour on him.
{21:6} For You have made him most blessed forever; You have made him glad with the joy of Your presence.
{21:7} For the sovereign is trusting in יהוה, And through the loving-commitment of the Most High he is not moved.
{21:8} Your hand reaches all Your enemies; Your right hand reaches those who hate You.
{21:9} You make them as a furnace of fire in the time of Your presence; יהוה does swallow them up in His wrath, And fire does consume them.
{21:10} You destroy their fruit from the earth, And their seed from among the sons of men.
{21:11} For they held out evil against You; They devised a plot; they do not prevail.
{21:12} For You make them turn their back, When You aim with Your bowstring toward their faces.
{21:13} Be exalted, O יהוה, in Your strength! We sing and we praise Your might.
{22:1} My Ěl, My Ěl, why have You forsaken Me – Far from saving Me, far from the words of My groaning?
{22:2} O My Elohim, I call by day, but You do not answer; And by night, but I find no rest.
{22:3} Yet You are set-apart, Enthroned on the praises of Yisra’ĕl.
{22:4} Our fathers trusted in You; They trusted, and You delivered them.
{22:5} They cried to You, and were delivered; They trusted in You, and were not ashamed.
{22:6} But I am a worm, and no man; A reproach of men, and despised by the people.
{22:7} All those who see Me mock Me; They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,
{22:8} He trusted in יהוה, let Him rescue Him; Let Him deliver Him, seeing He has delighted in Him!
{22:9} For You are the One who took Me out of the womb; Causing Me to trust while on My mother’s breasts.
{22:10} I was cast upon You from birth. From My mother’s belly You have been My Ěl.
{22:11} Do not be far from Me, For distress is near; For there is none to help.
{22:12} Many bulls have surrounded Me; Strong ones of Bashan have encircled Me.
{22:13} They have opened their mouths against Me, As a raging and roaring lion.
{22:14} I have been poured out like water, And all My bones have been spread apart; My heart has become like wax; It has melted in the midst of My inward parts.
{22:15} My strength is dried like a potsherd, And My tongue is cleaving to My jaws; And to the dust of death You are appointing Me.
{22:16} For dogs have surrounded Me; A crowd of evil ones have encircled Me, Piercing My hands and My feet;
{22:17} I count all My bones. They look, they stare at Me.
{22:18} They divide My garments among them, And for My raiment they cast lots.
{22:19} But You, O יהוה, do not be far off; O My Strength, hasten to help Me!
{22:20} Deliver My life from the sword, My only life from the power of the dog.
{22:21} Save Me from the mouth of the lion, And from the horns of the wild beasts! You have answered Me.
{22:22} I make known Your Name to My brothers; In the midst of the assembly I praise You.
{22:23} You who fear יהוה, praise Him! All you seed of Ya‛aqoḇ, esteem Him, And fear Him, all you seed of Yisra’ĕl!
{22:24} For He has not despised Nor hated the affliction of the afflicted; Nor has He hidden His face from Him; But when He cried to Him, He heard.
{22:25} From You is My praise in the great assembly; I pay My vows before those who fear Him.
{22:26} The meek ones do eat and are satisfied; Let those who seek Him praise יהוה. Let your heart live forever!
{22:27} Let all the ends of the earth Remember and turn to יהוה, And all clans of the nations Bow themselves before You.
{22:28} For the reign belongs to יהוה, And He is ruling over the nations.
{22:29} All the fat ones of the earth Shall eat and bow themselves; All who go down to the dust bow before Him, Even he who did not keep alive his own life.
{22:30} A seed shall serve Him. It is declared of יהוה to the coming generation.
{22:31} They shall come and declare His righteousness To a people yet to be born, For He shall do it!
{23:1} יהוה is my shepherd; I do not lack.
{23:2} He makes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside still waters.
{23:3} He turns back my being; He leads me in paths of righteousness For His Name’s sake.
{23:4} When I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil. For You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.
{23:5} You spread before me a table in the face of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; My cup runs over.
{23:6} Only goodness and loving-commitment follow me All the days of my life; And I shall dwell in the House of יהוה, To the length of days!
{24:1} The earth belongs to יהוה, And all that fills it – The world and those who dwell in it.
{24:2} For He has founded it upon the seas, And upon the waters He does establish it.
{24:3} Who does go up into the mountain of יהוה? And who does stand in His set-apart place?
{24:4} He who has innocent hands and a clean heart, Who did not bring his life to naught, And did not swear deceivingly.
{24:5} He receives a blessing from יהוה, And righteousness from the Elohim of his deliverance.
{24:6} This is the generation of those who seek Him; Ya‛aqoḇ, who seek Your face. Selah.
{24:7} Lift up your heads, O you gates! And be lifted up, you everlasting doors! And let the Sovereign of esteem come in.
{24:8} Who is this Sovereign of esteem? יהוה strong and mighty, יהוה mighty in battle.
{24:9} Lift up your heads, O you gates! Even lift up, you everlasting doors! And let the Sovereign of esteem come in.
{24:10} Who is this Sovereign of esteem? יהוה of hosts, He is the Sovereign of esteem! Selah.
{25:1} Aleph To You, O יהוה, I lift up my being.
{25:2} Bĕt O my Elohim, in You I have put my trust; Let me not be ashamed; Let not my enemies exult over me.
{25:3} Gimel Indeed, let no one who waits on You be ashamed; Let those who are treacherous without cause be ashamed.
{25:4} Dalet Show me Your ways, O יהוה; Teach me Your paths.
{25:5} Hĕ Lead me in Your truth (Waw) and teach me, For You are the Elohim of my deliverance; On You I wait all the day.
{25:6} Zayin Remember, O יהוה, Your compassion and Your loving-commitments, For they are from everlasting.
{25:7} Ḥet Do not remember the sins of my youth, and my transgressions; According to Your loving-commitment remember me, For Your goodness’ sake, O יהוה.
{25:8} Tet Good and straight is יהוה; Therefore He teaches sinners in the way.
{25:9} Yod He guides the meek ones in right-ruling, And He teaches the meek ones His way.
{25:10} Kaph All the paths of יהוה are loving-commitment and truth, To those who guard His covenant and His witnesses.
{25:11} Lamed For Your Name’s sake, O יהוה, You shall pardon my crookedness, though it is great.
{25:12} Mem Who, then, is the man that fears יהוה? He teaches him in the way he should choose.
{25:13} Nun His life dwells in good, And his seed inherits the earth.
{25:14} Sameḵ The secret of יהוה is with those who fear Him, And He makes His covenant known to them.
{25:15} Ayin My eyes are ever toward יהוה, For He brings my feet out of the net.
{25:16} Pĕ Turn Your face to me, and show me favour, For I am lonely and afflicted.
{25:17} Tsadi The distresses of my heart have enlarged; Oh, bring me out of my distresses!
{25:18} Rĕsh Look on my affliction and my toil, And forgive all my sins.
{25:19} Rĕsh See how many my enemies have become; And they hate me with a violent hatred.
{25:20} Shin Oh, guard my life, and deliver me; Let me not be ashamed, for I have taken refuge in You.
{25:21} Taw Let integrity and straightness guard me, For I have waited for You.
{25:22} Redeem Yisra’ĕl, O Elohim, Out of all his distresses!
{26:1} Rule me rightly, O יהוה, For I have walked in my integrity. And I have trusted in יהוה, without wavering.
{26:2} Examine me, O יהוה, and prove me; Try my kidneys and my heart.
{26:3} For Your loving-commitment is before my eyes, And I have walked in Your truth.
{26:4} I have not sat with men of falsehood, Nor do I enter with pretenders.
{26:5} I have hated the assembly of evil-doers, And I do not sit with the wrong.
{26:6} I wash my hands in innocence; And I walk around Your slaughter-place, O יהוה,
{26:7} To raise a voice of thanksgiving, And to declare all Your wonders.
{26:8} יהוה, I have loved the abode of Your house, And the place where Your esteem dwells.
{26:9} Do not gather my being together with sinners, Nor my life with bloodthirsty men,
{26:10} In whose hands is a plot, And their right hand is filled with bribes.
{26:11} But as for me, I walk in my integrity; Redeem me and show me favour.
{26:12} My foot shall stand on a level place; In the assemblies I bless יהוה.
{27:1} יהוה is my light and my deliverance; Whom should I fear? יהוה is the refuge of my life; Whom should I dread?
{27:2} When evil-doers come against me To eat up my flesh, My adversaries and my enemies, They shall stumble and fall.
{27:3} Though an army encamps against me, My heart does not fear; Though battle comes up against me, Even then I would be trusting.
{27:4} One matter I asked of יהוה – this I seek: To dwell in the House of יהוה All the days of my life, To see the pleasantness of יהוה, And to inquire in His Hĕḵal.
{27:5} For in the day of evil He hides me in His booth; In the covering of His Tent He hides me; On a rock He raises me up.
{27:6} And now my head is lifted up above my enemies all around me; And I slaughter in His Tent with slaughters of sounding; I sing, yes, I sing praises to יהוה.
{27:7} Hear, O יהוה, when I cry with my voice! And show me favour, and answer me.
{27:8} To my heart You have said, “Seek My face.” Your face, יהוה, I seek.
{27:9} Do not hide Your face from me; Do not turn Your servant away in displeasure; You have been my help; Do not leave me nor forsake me, O Elohim of my deliverance.
{27:10} When my father and my mother have forsaken me, Then יהוה does take me in.
{27:11} Teach me Your way, O יהוה, And lead me in a smooth path, because of my enemies.
{27:12} Do not give me over To the desire of my adversaries; For false witnesses have risen against me, And they breathe out cruelty to me.
{27:13} What if I had not believed To see the goodness of יהוה In the land of the living!
{27:14} Wait on יהוה, be strong, And let Him strengthen your heart! Wait, I say, on יהוה!
{28:1} I cry to You, O יהוה my Rock: Do not be deaf to me! For if You are silent to me, I shall be like those who go down to the pit.
{28:2} Hear the voice of my prayers when I cry to You, When I lift up my hands Toward Your Set-apart Speaking Place.
{28:3} Do not draw me away with the wrong And with the workers of wickedness, Who speak peace to their neighbours, But evil is in their hearts.
{28:4} Give to them according to their deeds, And according to the evil of their practices; Give to them according to the work of their hands; Bring back to them what they deserve.
{28:5} Because they do not heed the works of יהוה, Nor the works of His hands, He throws them down, And does not build them up.
{28:6} Blessed be יהוה, Because He has heard the voice of my prayers!
{28:7} יהוה is my strength, and my shield; My heart has trusted in Him, and I have been helped; Therefore my heart exults, And with my song I thank Him.
{28:8} יהוה is the strength of His people, And He is the stronghold of deliverance of His anointed.
{28:9} Save Your people, and bless Your inheritance; And be their Shepherd, and bear them up forever.
{29:1} Ascribe to יהוה, O you sons of the mighty, Ascribe to יהוה esteem and strength.
{29:2} Ascribe to יהוה the esteem of His Name; Bow yourselves to יהוה in the splendour of set-apartness.
{29:3} The voice of יהוה is over the waters; The Ěl of esteem thunders; יהוה is over many waters.
{29:4} The voice of יהוה is with power, The voice of יהוה is with greatness.
{29:5} The voice of יהוה is breaking the cedars, יהוה is breaking the cedars of Leḇanon in pieces.
{29:6} And He makes them skip like a calf, Leḇanon and Siryon like a young wild ox.
{29:7} The voice of יהוה cuts through the flames of fire.
{29:8} The voice of יהוה shakes the wilderness; יהוה shakes the Wilderness of Qaḏĕsh.
{29:9} The voice of יהוה makes the deer give birth, And strips the forests bare; And in His Hĕḵal everyone says, “Esteem!”
{29:10} יהוה sat enthroned at the Flood, And יהוה sits as Sovereign forever.
{29:11} יהוה gives strength to His people; יהוה blesses His people with peace.
{30:1} I exalt You, O יהוה, for You have drawn me up, And have not let my enemies rejoice over me.
{30:2} יהוה my Elohim, I have cried to You, And You have healed me.
{30:3} יהוה, You brought me up from She’ol; You have kept me alive, from going down into the pit.
{30:4} Sing praise to יהוה, You lovingly-committed ones of His, And give thanks at the remembrance of His Set-apartness.
{30:5} For His displeasure is for a moment, His delight is for life; Weeping might last for the night, But joy comes in the morning.
{30:6} As for me, I have said in my ease, “Never would I be shaken!”
{30:7} יהוה, in Your good pleasure You have made my mountain to stand strong; You hid Your face, and I was troubled.
{30:8} I cried out to You, O יהוה; And to יהוה I prayed:
{30:9} “What gain is there in my blood, When I go down to the pit? Would dust praise You? Would it declare Your truth?
{30:10} “Hear, O יהוה, and show me favour; יהוה, be my helper!”
{30:11} You have turned my mourning into dancing for me; You have torn off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness,
{30:12} So that esteem might praise You and not be silent. O יהוה my Elohim, I thank You forever.
{31:1} In You, O יהוה, I have taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed; Deliver me in Your righteousness.
{31:2} Incline Your ear to me, Deliver me speedily; Be a rock of refuge to me, A house of defence to save me.
{31:3} For You are my rock and my stronghold; For Your Name’s sake lead me and guide me.
{31:4} Bring me out of the net which they have hidden for me, For You are my stronghold.
{31:5} Into Your hand I commit my spirit; You have redeemed me, O יהוה Ěl of truth.
{31:6} I have hated those who observe lying vanities; But I trust in יהוה.
{31:7} I exult and rejoice in Your loving-commitment, For You have seen my affliction; You have known the distresses of my life,
{31:8} And You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy. You have set my feet in a large place.
{31:9} Show me favour, O יהוה, for I am in distress; My eye, my being and my body have become old with grief!
{31:10} For my life is consumed in sorrow, And my years in sighing; My strength fails because of my crookedness, And my bones have become old.
{31:11} I am a reproach among all my adversaries, But most of all among my neighbours, And a dread to my friends; Those who see me outside flee from me.
{31:12} I have been forgotten like someone dead from the heart; I have been like a missing vessel.
{31:13} For I hear the evil report of many; Fear is from all around; When they take counsel together against me, They plot to take away my life.
{31:14} But I, I have put my trust in You, O יהוה; I have said, “You are my Elohim.”
{31:15} My times are in Your hand; Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, And from those who pursue me.
{31:16} Make Your face shine upon Your servant; Save me in Your loving-commitment.
{31:17} Do not let me be ashamed, O יהוה, For I have called upon You; Let the wrong be ashamed; Let them be silenced in She’ol.
{31:18} Let lips of falsehood be stilled, Which speak recklessly against the righteous, With pride and scorn.
{31:19} How great is Your goodness, Which You have laid up for those fearing You, Which You have prepared for those taking refuge in You In the sight of the sons of men!
{31:20} In the secrecy of Your presence You shall hide them from the plots of man; You shelter them in a booth from the strife of tongues.
{31:21} Blessed be יהוה, For He has made marvellous His loving-commitment to me in a strong city!
{31:22} And I, I have said in my haste, “I am cut off from before Your eyes,” Yet You heard the voice of my prayers When I cried out to You.
{31:23} Love יהוה, all you His lovingly-committed ones! For יהוה guards the trustworthy ones, And exceedingly repays the doer of pride.
{31:24} Be strong, and let Him fortify your heart, All you who are waiting for יהוה.
{32:1} Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered.
{32:2} Blessed is the man to whom יהוה imputes no crookedness, And in whose spirit there is no deceit.
{32:3} When I kept silent, my bones became old Through my groaning all the day.
{32:4} For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; My sap was turned into the droughts of summer. Selah.
{32:5} I acknowledged my sin to You, And my crookedness I did not hide. I have said, “I confess my transgressions to יהוה,” And You forgave the crookedness of my sin. Selah.
{32:6} Therefore, let every lovingly-committed one pray to You While You might be found; Even in a flood of great waters They would not reach him.
{32:7} You are my hiding place; You preserve me from distress; You surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah.
{32:8} “Let Me instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; Let Me counsel, My eye be on you.
{32:9} Do not be like the horse, like the mule, With no understanding, with bit and bridle, Else they do not come near you.”
{32:10} Many are the sorrows of the wrong; But as for the one trusting in יהוה, Loving-commitment surrounds him.
{32:11} Be glad in יהוה and exult, you righteous; And shout for joy, all you upright in heart!
{33:1} Shout for joy in יהוה, you righteous! Praise is fitting for the straight!
{33:2} Praise יהוה with the lyre; Sing to Him with an instrument of ten strings.
{33:3} Sing to Him a new song; Play sweetly with a shout of joy.
{33:4} For the Word of יהוה is straight, And all His works are in truth,
{33:5} Loving righteousness and right-ruling; The earth is filled with the loving-commitment of יהוה.
{33:6} By the Word of יהוה the heavens were made, And all their host by the Spirit of His mouth,
{33:7} Gathering the waters of the sea together as a heap; Laying up the deep in storehouses.
{33:8} Let all the earth fear יהוה; Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.
{33:9} For He spoke, and it came to be; He commanded, and it stood fast.
{33:10} יהוה brings the counsel of the nations to naught; He thwarts the plans of the peoples.
{33:11} The counsel of יהוה stands forever, The plans of His heart to all generations.
{33:12} Blessed is the nation whose Elohim is יהוה, The people whom He has chosen as His own inheritance.
{33:13} יהוה has looked from the heavens; He has seen all the sons of men.
{33:14} He looked from His dwelling place On all the inhabitants of the earth –
{33:15} He who fashions the hearts of them all, He who understands all their works.
{33:16} The sovereign is not saved by the multitude of an army; A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
{33:17} A horse is a vain means of safety; Neither does it rescue any by its great power.
{33:18} See, the eye of יהוה is on those fearing Him, On those waiting for His loving-commitment,
{33:19} To deliver their being from death, And to keep them alive during scarcity of food.
{33:20} Our being has longed for יהוה; Our help and our shield is He.
{33:21} For our heart does rejoice in Him, For we have put our trust in His set-apart Name.
{33:22} Let Your loving-commitment, O יהוה, be upon us, Even as we wait for You.
{34:1} Aleph I bless יהוה at all times; His praise is continually in my mouth.
{34:2} Bĕt My being makes its boast in יהוה; Let the humble hear and be glad.
{34:3} Gimel Oh, make יהוה great with me, And let us exalt His Name together.
{34:4} Dalet I sought יהוה, and He answered me, And delivered me from all my fears.
{34:5} Hĕ They looked to Him and were lightened, Waw And their faces were not ashamed.
{34:6} Zayin This poor one cried out and יהוה heard him, And saved him out of all his distresses.
{34:7} Ḥet The messenger of יהוה encamps all around those who fear Him, And rescues them.
{34:8} Tet Oh, taste and see that יהוה is good; Blessed is the man that takes refuge in Him!
{34:9} Yod Fear יהוה, you His set-apart ones, For there is no lack to them who fear Him!
{34:10} Kaph Young lions have lacked and been hungry; But those who seek יהוה lack not any good matter.
{34:11} Lamed Come, you children, listen to me; Let me teach you the fear of יהוה.
{34:12} Mem Who is the man who desires life, Who loves many days, in order to see good?
{34:13} Nun Keep your tongue from evil, And your lips from speaking deceit.
{34:14} Sameḵ Turn away from evil and do good; Seek peace, and pursue it.
{34:15} Ayin The eyes of יהוה are on the righteous, And His ears unto their cry.
{34:16} Pĕ The face of יהוה is against evil-doers, To cut off their remembrance from the earth.
{34:17} Tsadi The righteous cried out, and יהוה heard, And delivered them out of all their distresses.
{34:18} Qoph יהוה is near to the broken-hearted, And saves those whose spirit is crushed.
{34:19} Rĕsh Many are the evils of the righteous, But יהוה delivers him out of them all.
{34:20} Shin He is guarding all his bones; Not one of them is broken.
{34:21} Taw Evil does slay the wrong, And those who hate the righteous are guilty.
{34:22} יהוה redeems the lives of His servants, And none of those taking refuge in Him are guilty.
{35:1} O יהוה, strive with those who strive with me; Fight against those who fight against me.
{35:2} Take hold of shield and armour, And rise for my help.
{35:3} And draw out spear and lance, To meet those who pursue me. Say to my life, “I am your deliverance.”
{35:4} Let those be ashamed and blush Who seek my life; Let those be turned back and abashed Who plot evil to me.
{35:5} Let them be as chaff before the wind, With a messenger of יהוה driving on.
{35:6} Let their way be dark and slippery, With a messenger of יהוה pursuing them.
{35:7} For without cause they hid their net for me; Without cause they dug a pit for my life.
{35:8} Let ruin come upon him unawares, And let his net that he hid catch himself; Let him fall in it, into ruin.
{35:9} But let my own being exult in יהוה; Let it rejoice in His deliverance.
{35:10} Let all my bones say, “יהוה, who is like You, Delivering the poor from one stronger than he, And the poor and the needy from him who robs him?”
{35:11} Ruthless witnesses rise up; They ask me that which I knew not.
{35:12} They reward me evil for good, bereaving my life.
{35:13} But I, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth; I humbled my being with fastings; And my prayer would return to my own bosom.
{35:14} I walked about as though he were my friend or brother; I bowed down mourning, as one mourning for a mother.
{35:15} But they rejoiced at my stumbling And gathered together; The smiters gathered against me, And I did not know it; They tore in pieces without ceasing,
{35:16} With unclean ones, mockers at feasts, Gnashing at me with their teeth.
{35:17} יהוה, how long would You look on? Rescue my being from their destructions, My only life from the lions.
{35:18} I give You thanks in the great assembly; I praise You among a mighty people.
{35:19} Let not my lying enemies rejoice over me; Or those who hate me without cause wink their eyes.
{35:20} For they do not speak peace, But they devise words of deceit Against the peaceable ones of the land.
{35:21} And they open their mouth wide against me, They said, “Aha, aha! Our eyes have seen it.”
{35:22} This You have seen, O יהוה; Do not be silent. O יהוה, do not be far from me.
{35:23} Stir up Yourself and awake to my right-ruling – To my cause, my Elohim and my Master.
{35:24} Rule me rightly, O יהוה my Elohim, According to Your righteousness; And let them not rejoice over me.
{35:25} Let them not say in their hearts, “Aha, our desire!” Let them not say, “We have swallowed him up.”
{35:26} Let those who are rejoicing at my evil Be ashamed and abashed altogether; Let those who are exalting themselves over me Be clad in shame and humiliation.
{35:27} Let those who delight in my righteous cause Shout for joy and be glad, And let them always say, “Let יהוה be made great, Who is desiring the peace of His servant.”
{35:28} And my tongue shall speak of Your righteousness, Your praise, All day long.
{36:1} Transgression speaks to the wrong within his heart; Fear of Elohim is not before his eyes.
{36:2} For he flatters himself in his own eyes, To find his crookedness to be hated.
{36:3} The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; He has ceased to be wise, to do good.
{36:4} He plots wickedness on his bed; He sets himself in a way that is not good; He does not despise evil.
{36:5} O יהוה, Your loving-commitment is in the heavens, And Your trustworthiness reaches to the clouds.
{36:6} Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains; Your right-rulings are a great deep; O יהוה, You save man and beast.
{36:7} How precious is Your loving-commitment, O Elohim! And the sons of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.
{36:8} They are filled from the fatness of Your house, And You give them drink from the river of Your pleasures.
{36:9} For with You is the fountain of life; In Your light we see light.
{36:10} Draw out Your loving-commitment to those who know You, And Your righteousness to the upright in heart.
{36:11} Let not the foot of pride come against me, And the hand of the wrong drive me away.
{36:12} There the workers of wickedness have fallen; They have been overthrown And have been unable to rise.
{37:1} Aleph Do not fret because of evil-doers, Do not be envious of the workers of unrighteousness.
{37:2} For they soon wither like grass, And fade like green plants.
{37:3} Bĕt Trust in יהוה, and do good; Dwell in the earth, and feed on steadfastness.
{37:4} And delight yourself in יהוה, And let Him give you the desires of your heart.
{37:5} Gimel Commit your way to יהוה, And trust in Him, and He does it.
{37:6} And He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, And your right-ruling as midday.
{37:7} Dalet Rest in יהוה, and wait patiently for Him; Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way, Because of the man doing wicked devices.
{37:8} Hĕ Abstain from displeasure, and forsake wrath; Do not fret, also to do evil.
{37:9} For evil-doers are cut off; But those who wait on יהוה, They shall inherit the earth.
{37:10} Waw Yet a little while and the wrong is no more; And you shall look on his place, But it is not.
{37:11} But the meek ones shall inherit the earth, And delight themselves in plenty of peace.
{37:12} Zayin The wrong plots against the righteous, And gnashes his teeth at him.
{37:13} יהוה laughs at him, For He sees that his day is coming.
{37:14} Ḥet The wrong have drawn the sword And have bent their bow, To cause the poor and needy to fall, To slay those who walk straightly.
{37:15} Their sword does enter into their own heart, And their bows are broken.
{37:16} Tet Better is the little of the righteous one, Than the riches of many wrongdoers.
{37:17} For the arms of the wrongdoers are broken, But יהוה sustains the righteous.
{37:18} Yod יהוה knows the days of the perfect, And their inheritance is forever.
{37:19} They are not ashamed in a time of evil, And in the days of scarcity of food they are satisfied.
{37:20} Kaph But the wrongdoers shall perish; And the enemies of יהוה, Like the splendour of the meadows they vanish, Like smoke they vanish away.
{37:21} Lamed The wrongdoer is borrowing and does not repay, But the righteous one shows favour and gives.
{37:22} For His blessed ones inherit the earth, But those cursed by Him are cut off.
{37:23} Mem The steps of a man are ordered by יהוה, And He delights in his way.
{37:24} Though he falls, he is not cast down, For יהוה is supporting his hand.
{37:25} Nun I have been young, and now I am old; Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, Or his seed begging bread.
{37:26} All day long he is showing favour and lending; And his seed is for a blessing.
{37:27} Sameḵ Turn away from evil, and do good; And dwell forever.
{37:28} For יהוה loves right-ruling, And does not forsake His lovingly-committed ones; They shall be guarded forever, But the seed of the wrongdoers is cut off.
{37:29} The righteous shall inherit the earth, And dwell in it forever.
{37:30} Pĕ The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, And his tongue talks of right-ruling.
{37:31} The Torah of his Elohim is in his heart; His steps do not slide.
{37:32} Tsadi The wrong one is watching for the righteous, And is seeking to slay him.
{37:33} יהוה does not leave him in his hand, Or let him be declared wrong when he is judged.
{37:34} Qoph Wait on יהוה and guard His way, And He shall exalt you to inherit the earth – When the wrongdoers are cut off, you shall see it.
{37:35} Rĕsh I have seen the wrongdoer in great power, And spreading himself like a native green tree.
{37:36} Yet he passed away, and see, he was not; And I sought him, but he was not found.
{37:37} Shin Watch the perfect, and observe the straight; For the latter end of each is peace.
{37:38} But the transgressors shall be destroyed together; The latter end of the wrong shall be cut off.
{37:39} Taw But the deliverance of the righteous is from יהוה, Their strength in time of distress.
{37:40} And יהוה does help them and deliver them; He delivers them from the wrongdoers and saves them, Because they took refuge in Him.
{38:1} O יהוה, do not rebuke me in Your wrath, Nor chastise me in Your hot displeasure!
{38:2} For Your arrows have pierced me, And Your hand comes down on me.
{38:3} There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your rage, Nor peace in my bones because of my sin.
{38:4} For my crookednesses have passed over my head; Like a heavy burden, too heavy for me.
{38:5} My wounds have become stinky, festering Because of my folly.
{38:6} I have been bent down; I have been bowed down very much; All day long I have gone mourning.
{38:7} For my loins have become filled with burning, And there is no soundness in my flesh.
{38:8} I have become weak and greatly crushed; I howled from the groaning of my heart.
{38:9} יהוה, all my desire is before You; And my sighing has not been hid from You.
{38:10} My heart is throbbing, my strength has forsaken me; And the light of my eyes also is not with me.
{38:11} My loved ones and my friends stand back from my plague, And my neighbours stand far away.
{38:12} And those seeking my life lay a snare; And those seeking my evil have spoken of destruction, And utter deceit all day long.
{38:13} But I, as one deaf, do not hear; And as a dumb one who does not open his mouth.
{38:14} I am like a man who does not hear, And who has no rebukes in his mouth.
{38:15} For on You, O יהוה, I have waited; You do answer, O יהוה my Elohim.
{38:16} For I said, “Otherwise they would rejoice over me, When my foot slips they would exalt themselves over me.”
{38:17} For I am ready to fall, And my pain is always with me.
{38:18} For I confess my crookedness; I am sorry over my sin.
{38:19} But my enemies are alive; They have become strong; And those hating me falsely are many.
{38:20} And those who repay evil for good, They oppose me, because I follow what is good.
{38:21} Do not forsake me, O יהוה; O my Elohim, be not far from me!
{38:22} Hasten to help me, O יהוה, my deliverance!
{39:1} I have said,”Let me guard my ways Against sinning with my tongue; Let me guard my mouth with a muzzle, While the wrongdoer is before me.”
{39:2} I became dumb, keeping still; I was silent, from good; And my pain was stirred.
{39:3} My heart was hot within me; While I was meditating, the fire burned. Then I spoke with my tongue:
{39:4} “יהוה, let me know my end, And the measure of my days, what it is, Let me know how short-lived I am.
{39:5} See, You have made my days as handbreadths, And my lifetime is as non-existence before You; Only, all men standing, are all breath. Selah.”
{39:6} As but a shadow each one walks; They busy themselves, only in vain; He heaps up wealth, But knows not who gathers them.
{39:7} “And now, יהוה, what do I wait for? My expectancy is in You.
{39:8} Deliver me from all my transgressions; Do not make me the reproach of the foolish.”
{39:9} “I was dumb, I did not open my mouth, Because it was You who did it.
{39:10} Turn aside Your stroke from me; I am overcome by the blow of Your hand.”
{39:11} “When You chastise man for crookedness with reproofs, You consume what he loves, like a moth; All men are but a breath. Selah.
{39:12} Hear my prayer, O יהוה, And give ear to my cry; Do not be silent at my tears; For I am a stranger with You, A sojourner, as all my fathers were.”
{39:13} Look away from me, That I might brighten up, Before I go away and am no more.
{40:1} I waited, waited for יהוה; And He inclined to me, and heard my cry.
{40:2} And He drew me Out of the pit of destruction, Out of the muddy clay, And He set my feet upon a rock, He is establishing my steps.
{40:3} Then He put a new song in my mouth; Praise to our Elohim; Many do see it and fear, And trust in יהוה.
{40:4} Blessed is that man who has made יהוה his trust, And has not turned to the proud, And those turning aside to falsehood.
{40:5} O יהוה my Elohim, many are the wonders Which You have done, and Your purposes toward us; There is no one to compare with You; I declare and speak: They are too many to be numbered.
{40:6} Slaughtering and meal offering You did not desire; You have opened my ears; Ascending offering and sin offering You did not ask for.
{40:7} Then I said, “See, I have come; In the scroll of the Book it is prescribed for me.
{40:8} I have delighted to do Your pleasure, O my Elohim, And Your Torah is within my heart.”
{40:9} I have proclaimed the good news of righteousness, In the great assembly; See, I do not restrain my lips, O יהוה, You know.
{40:10} I did not conceal Your righteousness within my heart; I have declared Your trustworthiness and Your deliverance; I did not hide Your loving-commitment and Your truth From the great assembly.
{40:11} Do not withhold Your compassion from me, O יהוה; Let Your loving-commitment and Your truth always watch over me.
{40:12} For evils without number have surrounded me; My crookednesses have overtaken me, And I have been unable to see; They became more than the hairs of my head; And my heart has failed me.
{40:13} Be pleased, O יהוה, to deliver me; O יהוה, hasten to help me!
{40:14} Let those who seek to destroy my life Be ashamed and abashed altogether; Let those who are desiring my evil Be driven back and put to shame.
{40:15} Let those who say to me, “Aha, aha!” Be appalled at their own shame.
{40:16} Let all those who seek You Rejoice and be glad in You; Let those who love Your deliverance always say, “יהוה be exalted!”
{40:17} But I am poor and needy; Let יהוה think upon me. You are my help and my deliverer; O my Elohim, do not delay!
{41:1} Blessed is he who considers the poor; יהוה does deliver him in a day of evil.
{41:2} יהוה does guard him and keep him alive; He is blessed on the earth, And You do not hand him over To the desire of his enemies.
{41:3} יהוה sustains him on his sickbed; In his weakness on his bed You bring a change.
{41:4} As for me, I said, “O יהוה, show me favour; Heal me, for I have sinned against You.”
{41:5} My enemies speak evil of me, “When he dies his name shall perish.”
{41:6} And when one comes to visit, he speaks falsely; His heart gathers wickedness to itself; He goes out, he speaks of it.
{41:7} All who hate me whisper together against me; They plot evil to me, saying,
{41:8} A matter of Beliya‛al is poured out on him, That when he lies down, he would not rise again.
{41:9} Even my own friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, Has lifted up his heel against me.
{41:10} But You, יהוה, show me favour and raise me up, And let me repay them.
{41:11} By this I know that You did delight in me, Because my enemy does not shout for joy over me.
{41:12} And I, You uphold me in my integrity, And set me before Your face forever.
{41:13} Blessed be יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl From everlasting to everlasting! Amĕn and Amĕn.
{42:1} As a deer longs for the water streams, So my being longs for You, O Elohim.
{42:2} My being thirsts for Elohim, for the living Ěl. When shall I enter in to appear before Elohim?
{42:3} My tears have been my food day and night, While they say to me all day, “Where is your Elohim?”
{42:4} These I remember, and pour out my being within me. For I used to pass along with the throng; I went with them to the House of Elohim, With the voice of joy and praise, A multitude celebrating a festival!
{42:5} Why are you depressed, O my being? And why are you restless within me? Wait for Elohim: for I shall yet thank Him, For the deliverance of His face!
{42:6} O my Elohim, my being is depressed within me; Therefore I remember You from the land of the Yardĕn, And from the heights of Ḥermon, From Mount Mits‛ar.
{42:7} Deep calls to deep at the sound of Your waterfalls; All Your waves and breakers passed over me.
{42:8} By day יהוה commands His loving-commitment, And by night His song is with me; A prayer to the Ěl of my life.
{42:9} I say to Ěl my Rock, “Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”
{42:10} With murder in my bones, My enemies have reproached me, While they say to me all day long, “Where is your Elohim?”
{42:11} Why are you depressed, O my being? And why are you restless within me? Wait for Elohim: for I shall yet thank Him, the deliverance of my face, And my Elohim.
{43:1} Rule me rightly, O Elohim, And plead my cause against a nation without loving-commitment. Oh, deliver me from a man of deceit and unrighteousness!
{43:2} For You are the Elohim of my strength. Why have You rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
{43:3} Send forth Your light and Your truth! Let them lead me, Let them bring me to Your set-apart mountain And to Your dwelling places.
{43:4} That I might come to the slaughter-place of Elohim, To Ěl, the joy of my delight, And praise You with the lyre, O Elohim, my Elohim.
{43:5} Why are you depressed, O my being? And why are you restless within me? Wait for Elohim: for I shall yet thank Him, the deliverance of my face, And my Elohim.
{44:1} O Elohim, we have heard with our ears, Our fathers have related to us, The work You did in their days, In the days of old.
{44:2} You drove out the nations with Your hand, But them You planted. You afflicted peoples, and sent them out.
{44:3} For not by their own sword did they possess the land, Neither did their own arm save them; But it was Your right hand and Your arm, And the light of Your face, Because You delighted in them.
{44:4} You Yourself are my Sovereign, O Elohim; Command deliverances for Ya‛aqoḇ.
{44:5} Through You we push our enemies; Through Your Name we tread down those who rise up against us.
{44:6} For I do not trust in my bow, And my sword does not save me.
{44:7} For You have saved us from our enemies, And have put to shame those who hated us.
{44:8} In Elohim we shall boast all day long, And praise Your Name forever. Selah.
{44:9} Yet You have rejected us and put us to shame, And You do not go with our armies.
{44:10} You make us turn back from the adversary, And those who hate us have plundered us.
{44:11} You do give us as sheep to be eaten, And You have scattered us among the nations.
{44:12} You sell Your people for no value, And have set no high price on them.
{44:13} You make us a reproach to our neighbours, A scorn and a mockery to those round about us.
{44:14} You make us a proverb among the nations, A shaking of the head among the peoples.
{44:15} My reproach is always before me, And the shame of my face has covered me,
{44:16} Because of the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer, Because of the enemy and avenger.
{44:17} All this has come upon us; But we have not forgotten You, Neither have we been false to Your covenant.
{44:18} Our heart has not turned back, Neither has our step swerved from Your way,
{44:19} Yet You have crushed us in the place of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death.
{44:20} If we have forgotten the Name of our Elohim, Or stretched out our hands to a foreign mighty one,
{44:21} Would Elohim not search this out? For He knows the secrets of the heart.
{44:22} But for Your sake we are killed all day long; Reckoned as sheep for the slaughter.
{44:23} Awake! Why do You sleep, O יהוה? Arise! Do not reject us forever.
{44:24} Why do You hide Your face, Ignoring our affliction and our oppression?
{44:25} For our being is bowed down to the dust; Our body cleaves to the earth.
{44:26} Arise, be our help, And redeem us for Your loving-commitment’ sake.
{45:1} My heart is overflowing with a goodly word; I address my works to the Sovereign; My tongue is the pen of a speedy writer.
{45:2} You are more handsome than the sons of men; Favour has been poured upon Your lips; Therefore Elohim has blessed You forever.
{45:3} Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O Mighty One, Your excellency and Your splendour.
{45:4} And ride prosperously in Your splendour, On the matter of truth and humility, righteousness; And let Your right hand lead You to awesome matters.
{45:5} Your arrows are sharp In the heart of the Sovereign’s enemies – Peoples fall under You.
{45:6} Your throne, O Elohim, is forever and ever; The sceptre of Your reign Is a sceptre of straightness.
{45:7} You have loved righteousness and hated wrongness; Therefore Elohim, Your Elohim, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions.
{45:8} All Your garments are myrrh and aloes, cassia; Out of the palaces of ivory, Stringed instruments have made You glad.
{45:9} Daughters of sovereigns are among Your precious ones; At Your right hand stands the sovereigness in gold from Ophir.
{45:10} Listen, O daughter, and see, And incline your ear, And forget your own people and your father’s house;
{45:11} And let the Sovereign delight in your loveliness; Because He is your Master – bow yourself to Him.
{45:12} And the daughter of Tsor with a gift, The rich among the people seek your favour.
{45:13} The daughter of the Sovereign Is all esteemed within the palace; Her dress is embroidered with gold.
{45:14} She is brought to the Sovereign in embroidered work; Maidens, her companions following her, Are brought to You.
{45:15} They are brought with gladness and rejoicing; They enter the Sovereign’s palace.
{45:16} Instead of Your fathers are Your sons, Whom You appoint princes in all the earth.
{45:17} I cause Your Name to be remembered in all generations; Therefore the people praise You forever and ever.
{46:1} Elohim is our refuge and strength, A help in distress, soon found.
{46:2} Therefore we do not fear, Though the earth reels And mountains topple into the heart of the seas.
{46:3} Let its waters rage, foam; Let mountains shake with its swelling. Selah.
{46:4} A river whose streams Make glad the city of Elohim, The set-apart dwelling of the Most High.
{46:5} Elohim is in her midst, she does not topple; Elohim does help her when morning turns.
{46:6} The nations shall rage, Reigns shall topple; He shall give forth His voice, The earth melts.
{46:7} יהוה of hosts is with us; The Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ is our refuge. Selah.
{46:8} Come, see the works of יהוה, The ruins He has wrought on the earth,
{46:9} Causing all fighting to cease, Unto the end of the earth. He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; He burns the chariot with fire.
{46:10} Be still, and know that I am Elohim; I am exalted among nations, I am exalted in the earth!
{46:11} יהוה of hosts is with us; The Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ is our refuge. Selah.
{47:1} Oh, clap your hands, all you peoples! Shout to Elohim with a voice of singing!
{47:2} For יהוה Most High is awesome; A great Sovereign over all the earth.
{47:3} He subdues peoples under us, And nations under our feet.
{47:4} He chooses our inheritance for us, The excellence of Ya‛aqoḇ whom He loves. Selah.
{47:5} Elohim shall go up with a shout, יהוה with a voice of a shophar.
{47:6} Sing praises to Elohim, sing praises! Sing praises to our Sovereign, sing praises!
{47:7} For Elohim is Sovereign of all the earth; Sing praises with understanding.
{47:8} Elohim shall reign over the nations; Elohim shall sit on His set-apart throne.
{47:9} Nobles of peoples shall be gathered together, The people of the Elohim of Aḇraham. For the shields of the earth belong to Elohim; He shall be greatly exalted.
{48:1} Great is יהוה, and greatly to be praised In the city of our Elohim, His set-apart mountain.
{48:2} Beautiful on high, The joy of all the earth, Is Mount Tsiyon on the sides of the north, The city of the great Sovereign.
{48:3} Elohim is in her citadels; He is known as her refuge.
{48:4} For look, the sovereigns met, They passed by together.
{48:5} They saw, so they marvelled; They were alarmed, they hastened away.
{48:6} Trembling took hold of them there, Pain, as of a woman in labour,
{48:7} With an east wind You break the ships of Tarshish.
{48:8} As we have heard, so we have seen In the city of יהוה of hosts, In the city of our Elohim, Elohim establishes her forever. Selah.
{48:9} We have thought, O Elohim, of Your loving-commitment, In the midst of Your Hĕḵal.
{48:10} According to Your Name, O Elohim, So is Your praise to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is filled with righteousness.
{48:11} Let Mount Tsiyon rejoice, Let the daughters of Yehuḏah exult, Because of Your right-rulings.
{48:12} Walk about Tsiyon, And go all around her. Count her towers;
{48:13} Set your heart upon her rampart; Go through her citadels; So that you report it to the coming generation.
{48:14} For this Elohim is our Elohim, Forever and ever; He Himself leads us, Even to death.
{49:1} Hear this, all you peoples; Give ear, all you inhabitants of the world,
{49:2} Both sons of mankind and sons of man, Rich and poor together.
{49:3} My mouth speaks wisdom, And the meditation of my heart brings understanding.
{49:4} I incline my ear to a parable; I expound my riddle on the lyre.
{49:5} Why should I fear in the days of evil, When the crookedness of my supplanters surrounds me?
{49:6} Those who are trusting in their riches And who are boasting in their great wealth?
{49:7} A brother does not redeem anyone at all, Neither give to Elohim a ransom for him;
{49:8} For the redemption of their lives is costly, And it shall cease forever;
{49:9} That he should still live forever, And not see the pit.
{49:10} For he sees wise men die, The foolish and the ignorant both perish, And shall leave their wealth to others.
{49:11} Their inner thoughts are their houses, forever; Their dwelling places, to all generations; They call their lands after their own names.
{49:12} But man does not remain in esteem, He is like the beasts that perish.
{49:13} This way of theirs is folly to them, Yet their followers are pleased with their words. Selah.
{49:14} Like sheep they shall be laid in She’ol; Death shall shepherd them; And the upright rule over them in the morning; And their form is consumed in She’ol, Far from their dwelling.
{49:15} But Elohim does redeem my being From the power of She’ol, For He does receive me. Selah.
{49:16} Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich, When the wealth of his house increases;
{49:17} For when he dies he takes none of it; His wealth does not go down after him.
{49:18} Though while he lived he blessed himself, And though they praise you when you do well for yourself,
{49:19} He has to go to the generation of his fathers; They never see the light.
{49:20} Man, who is rich, Yet does not understand, Shall be like the beasts, They shall perish.
{50:1} Ěl Elohim יהוה shall speak, And He shall call the earth From the rising of the sun to its going down.
{50:2} From Tsiyon, the perfection of loveliness, Elohim shall shine forth.
{50:3} Our Elohim comes, and is not silent – A fire consumes before Him, And it shall be very stormy all around Him.
{50:4} He calls to the heavens from above, And to the earth, to rightly rule His people:
{50:5} Gather My lovingly-committed ones together to Me, Those who have made a covenant with Me by slaughtering.
{50:6} Then the heavens declared His righteousness, For Elohim Himself is Judge. Selah.
{50:7} “Hear, O My people, and I speak, O Yisra’ĕl, and I witness against you: I am Elohim, your Elohim!
{50:8} I do not reprove you for your slaughterings, And your ascending offerings are continually before Me.”
{50:9} “I do not take a bull from your house, Nor goats out of your pens.
{50:10} For every beast of the forest is Mine, The cattle on a thousand hills.”
{50:11} “I know all the birds of the mountains, And all moving in My field are Mine.
{50:12} If I were hungry, I would not speak to you; For the world is Mine, and all that fills it.”
{50:13} “Do I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of goats?
{50:14} Slaughter thanksgiving to Elohim, And pay your vows to the Most High.”
{50:15} And call upon Me in the day of distress – Let Me rescue you, and you esteem Me.
{50:16} But to the wrong Elohim said, “What right have you to recite My laws, Or take My covenant in your mouth,
{50:17} “While you hated instruction And cast My Words behind you?
{50:18} When you saw a thief, you were pleased with him, And you take part with adulterers.”
{50:19} “You let your mouth loose to evil, And your tongue frames deceit.
{50:20} You sit, speak against your brother; You slander your own mother’s son.”
{50:21} “You have done this, and I kept silent; You have thought that I was altogether like you – I rebuke you, and set it in order before your eyes.
{50:22} Understand this please, you who forget Eloah, Lest I tear you in pieces, With no one to deliver:"
{50:23} Whoever slaughters praise esteems Me; And to him who prepares a way, I show the deliverance of Elohim.
{51:1} Show me favour, O Elohim, According to Your loving-commitment; According to the greatness of Your compassion, Blot out my transgressions.
{51:2} Wash me completely from my guilt, And cleanse me from my sin.
{51:3} For I know my transgressions, And my sin is ever before me.
{51:4} Against You, You alone, have I sinned, And done evil in Your eyes; That You might be proven right in Your words; Be clear when You judge.
{51:5} See, I was brought forth in crookedness, And in sin my mother conceived me.
{51:6} See, You have desired truth in the inward parts, And in the hidden part You make me know wisdom.
{51:7} Cleanse me with hyssop, and I am clean; Wash me, and I am whiter than snow.
{51:8} Let me hear joy and gladness, Let the bones You have crushed rejoice.
{51:9} Hide Your face from my sins, And blot out all my crookednesses.
{51:10} Create in me a clean heart, O Elohim, And renew a steadfast spirit within me.
{51:11} Do not cast me away from Your presence, And do not take Your Set-apart Spirit from me.
{51:12} Restore to me the joy of Your deliverance, And uphold me, Noble Spirit!
{51:13} Let me teach transgressors Your ways, So that sinners turn back to You.
{51:14} Deliver me from blood-guilt, O Elohim, Elohim of my deliverance, Let my tongue sing aloud of Your righteousness.
{51:15} O יהוה, open my lips, And that my mouth declare Your praise.
{51:16} For You do not desire slaughtering, or I would give it; You do not delight in ascending offering.
{51:17} The slaughterings of Elohim are a broken spirit, A heart broken and crushed, O Elohim, These You do not despise.
{51:18} Do good in Your good pleasure to Tsiyon; Build the walls of Yerushalayim.
{51:19} Then You would delight in slaughterings of righteousness, In ascending offering and complete ascending offering; Then young bulls would be offered on Your slaughter-place.
{52:1} Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man? The loving-commitment of Ěl is all day long!
{52:2} Your tongue devises destruction, Like a sharp razor, working deceit.
{52:3} You loved evil more than good, Lying more than speaking righteousness. Selah.
{52:4} You loved all devouring words, O tongue of deceit.
{52:5} Let Ěl also break you down forever, Take you and pluck you out of your tent. And He shall uproot you From the land of the living. Selah.
{52:6} And let the righteous see and fear, And laugh at him, saying,
{52:7} See the man who did not make Elohim his strength, But trusted in his many riches, Being strong in his destruction.
{52:8} But I am like a green olive tree In the House of Elohim, I have trusted in the loving-commitment of Elohim Forever and ever.
{52:9} I thank You forever, Because You have done it; And in the presence of Your lovingly-committed ones I wait on Your Name, for it is good.
{53:1} The fool has said in his heart, “There is no Elohim.” They have done corruptly, And they have done abominable unrighteousness; No one does good.
{53:2} Elohim looked down from the heavens on the children of men, To see if there is a wise one, seeking Elohim.
{53:3} They have all turned aside; They have together become filthy; No one is doing good, not even one.
{53:4} Have the workers of wickedness no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And do not call on Elohim?
{53:5} There they are in great fear, Where no fear was, For Elohim shall scatter the bones Of him who encamps against you. You shall put them to shame, For Elohim has rejected them.
{53:6} O that the deliverance of Yisra’ĕl Would be given out of Tsiyon! When Elohim turns back the captivity of His people, Let Ya‛aqoḇ rejoice, let Yisra’ĕl be glad.
{54:1} O Elohim, save me by Your Name, And rightly rule me by Your might.
{54:2} Hear my prayer, O Elohim; Give ear to the words of my mouth.
{54:3} For strangers have risen up against me, And cruel men have sought after my life; They have not set Elohim before them. Selah.
{54:4} See, Elohim is my helper; יהוה is with those who sustain my life.
{54:5} He repays evil to my enemies. Cut them off in Your truth.
{54:6} Voluntarily I slaughter to You; I praise Your Name, O יהוה, for it is good.
{54:7} For He has delivered me out of all distress; And my eye has looked upon my enemies.
{55:1} Give ear to my prayer, O Elohim, And do not hide Yourself from my plea.
{55:2} Give heed to me, and answer me; I wander and moan in my complaint,
{55:3} Because of the noise of the enemy, Because of the outcry of the wrong; For they bring down wickedness upon me, And in wrath they hate me.
{55:4} My heart is pained within me, And the frights of death have fallen upon me.
{55:5} Fear and trembling have come upon me, And shuddering covers me.
{55:6} And I said, “Who would give me wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.
{55:7} “See, I would wander far off, I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah.
{55:8} “I would hasten my escape From the raging wind and storm.”
{55:9} Confuse, O יהוה, divide their tongues, For I saw violence and strife in the city.
{55:10} Day and night they go around it on its walls; Wickedness and trouble are also in the midst of it.
{55:11} Covetings are in its midst; Oppression and deceit do not vanish from its streets.
{55:12} It is not an enemy who reproaches me – That I could bear; Nor one who hates me who is making himself great against me – Then I could hide from him.
{55:13} But it was you, a man my equal, My companion and my friend.
{55:14} We took sweet counsel together, We walked to the House of Elohim in the throng.
{55:15} Let death come upon them; Let them go down into She’ol alive, For evil is in their dwellings, in their midst.
{55:16} I, I call upon Elohim, And יהוה saves me.
{55:17} Evening and morning and at noon I complain and moan, And He hears my voice.
{55:18} He has redeemed my life in peace From the battle against me, For there were many against me.
{55:19} Ěl, even He who sits enthroned from of old, Does hear and afflict them – Selah – Those with whom there are no changes, Those who do not fear Elohim.
{55:20} He has put forth his hands against those Who were at peace with him; He has broken his covenant.
{55:21} His mouth was smoother than curds, Yet in his heart is fighting; His words were softer than oil, But they are drawn swords.
{55:22} Cast your burden on יהוה, And let Him sustain you; He never allows the righteous to be shaken.
{55:23} For You, O Elohim, do bring them down To the pit of destruction; Men of blood and deceit do not reach half their days; But I, I trust in You.
{56:1} Show me favour, O Elohim, For man would swallow me up; Fighting all day long, he oppresses me.
{56:2} My enemies would swallow me up all day long, For many are fighting against me, O Most High.
{56:3} In the day I am afraid, I trust in You.
{56:4} In Elohim, whose Word I praise, In Elohim I have trusted; I do not fear; What could flesh do to me?
{56:5} All day long they twist my words; All their thoughts are against me for evil.
{56:6} They stir up strife, they hide, They watch my steps, As they lie in wait for my life.
{56:7} Because of wickedness, cast them out. Put down the peoples in displeasure, O Elohim!
{56:8} You have counted my wanderings; You put my tears into Your bottle; Are they not in Your book?
{56:9} My enemies turn back in the day I call; This I know, because Elohim is for me.
{56:10} In Elohim, whose Word I praise, In יהוה, whose Word I praise,
{56:11} In Elohim I have trusted; I do not fear; What could man do to me?
{56:12} On me, O Elohim, are Your vows; I render praises to You,
{56:13} For You have delivered my life from death, My feet from stumbling, That I might walk before Elohim, In the light of the living!
{57:1} Show me favour, O Elohim, show me favour! For in You my being is taking refuge; And in the shadow of Your wings I take refuge, Until destruction passes by.
{57:2} I cry out to the Most High Elohim, To Ěl who is perfecting all matters for me.
{57:3} He sends from the heavens and saves me; He reproaches the one who would swallow me up. Selah. Elohim sends forth His loving-commitment and His truth.
{57:4} My being is in the midst of lions; I lie among those who breathe fire, Whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue is a sharp sword.
{57:5} Be exalted, O Elohim, above the heavens; Let Your esteem be above all the earth.
{57:6} They have prepared a net for my footsteps; My being was bowed down; They have dug a pit before me; They fell into the midst of it! Selah.
{57:7} My heart is firm, O Elohim, My heart is firm; I sing and praise.
{57:8} Awake, my esteem! Awake, harp and lyre! I awake the dawn.
{57:9} I praise You among the peoples, O יהוה; I sing to You among the nations.
{57:10} For Your loving-commitment is great up to the heavens, And Your truth unto the clouds.
{57:11} Be exalted above the heavens, O Elohim; Let Your esteem be above all the earth.
{58:1} Would you indeed speak righteousness, in silence? Do you judge straightly, you sons of men?
{58:2} No, in heart you work unrighteousness; On earth you weigh out the violence of your hands.
{58:3} The wrong have been estranged from the womb; These who speak lies go astray from birth.
{58:4} Their poison is like the poison of a snake; Like a deaf cobra that stops its ear,
{58:5} So as not to hear the voice of whisperers, Or a skilled caster of spells.
{58:6} O Elohim, break their teeth in their mouth! Break out the fangs of the young lions, O יהוה!
{58:7} Let them melt, let them vanish as water; Let Him aim His arrows that they be cut down;
{58:8} Like a snail which melts away as it moves, Like a woman’s stillbirth, Let them not see the sun!
{58:9} Before your pots feel the thorns, Whether green or ablaze, He sweeps them away.
{58:10} The righteous rejoices when he has seen the vengeance, He washes his feet in the blood of the wrong,
{58:11} And man says, “Truly, the righteous are rewarded; Truly, there is an Elohim judging in the earth.”
{59:1} Deliver me from my enemies, O my Elohim; Set me on high from those who rise up against me.
{59:2} Deliver me from the workers of wickedness, And save me from men of blood.
{59:3} For look, they have lain in wait for my life; Mighty men assemble against me, For no transgression or sin of mine, O יהוה,
{59:4} For no guilt of mine! They run and prepare themselves. Awake to help me, and see!
{59:5} And You, יהוה Elohim of hosts, Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, Awake to punish all the nations; Show no favour to any wicked traitors. Selah.
{59:6} They return at evening, They howl like a dog, And go around the city.
{59:7} See, they belch out with their mouth, Swords are in their lips, For who is listening?
{59:8} But You, יהוה, laugh at them, You mock all the nations.
{59:9} O my Strength, I wait for You; For Elohim is my strong tower.
{59:10} My Elohim of loving-commitment, Elohim does go before me. He lets me look upon my enemies.
{59:11} Do not kill them, lest my people forget; Scatter them by Your power, And bring them down, O יהוה our shield.
{59:12} The sin of their mouth is the words of their lips, And they are captured in their pride, And for the cursing and lying they utter.
{59:13} Bring them to an end in wrath, Bring them to an end, That they be no more; And let them know That Elohim is ruling in Ya‛aqoḇ To the ends of the earth. Selah.
{59:14} And at evening they return, They howl like a dog, And go around the city.
{59:15} They wander up and down for food, And whine if they are not satisfied.
{59:16} And I, I sing of Your power; And in the morning I sing aloud of Your loving-commitment; For You have been my strong tower And a refuge in the day of my distress.
{59:17} O my Strength, to You I sing praises; For Elohim is my strong tower, My Elohim of loving-commitment.
{60:1} O Elohim, You have rejected us; You have broken us; You have been displeased; Turn back to us!
{60:2} You have made the earth tremble; You have broken it; Heal its breaches, for it is shaken.
{60:3} You have let Your people see hardship; You have made us drink the wine of trembling.
{60:4} You have given a banner to those who fear You, That it might be lifted up Because of the truth. Selah.
{60:5} That those You love might be rescued, Save with Your right hand and answer me.
{60:6} Elohim has spoken in His set-apartness, “I exult, I portion out Sheḵem And measure out the Valley of Sukkoth.
{60:7} Gil‛aḏ is Mine and Menashsheh is Mine, And Ephrayim is the defence of My head, Yehuḏah is My inscriber.
{60:8} Mo’aḇ is My wash-pot, Over Eḏom I cast My shoe, Shout loud, O Philistia, because of Me.
{60:9} Who would bring me to the strong city? Who shall lead me to Eḏom?
{60:10} Have not You, O Elohim, rejected us? And You do not go out, O Elohim, With our armies!
{60:11} Give us help from distress, For the help of man is naught.
{60:12} In Elohim we do mightily, And He treads down our adversaries!
{61:1} Hear my cry, O Elohim, Listen to my prayer.
{61:2} From the end of the earth I call unto You, When my heart is faint; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
{61:3} For You have been my refuge, A strong tower in the face of the enemy.
{61:4} Let me dwell in Your Tent forever, Let me take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah.
{61:5} For You, O Elohim, have heard my vows; You have given me the inheritance Of those who fear Your Name.
{61:6} You add days to the days of the sovereign, His years as many generations.
{61:7} Let him dwell forever before Elohim. Prepare loving-commitment and truth to preserve him!
{61:8} So I sing praise to Your Name forever, When I pay my vows day by day.
{62:1} My being finds rest in Elohim alone; From Him is my deliverance.
{62:2} He alone is my rock and my deliverance, my strong tower; I am not greatly shaken.
{62:3} How long would you shout at a man? – Murder! – Like a leaning wall, a tottering fence.
{62:4} They plotted to topple him from his high position; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, But in their heart they curse. Selah.
{62:5} My being, find rest in Elohim alone, Because my expectation is from Him.
{62:6} He alone is my rock and my deliverance, my strong tower; I am not shaken.
{62:7} My deliverance and my esteem depend on Elohim; The rock of my strength, my refuge is in Elohim.
{62:8} Trust in Him at all times, you people; Pour out your heart before Him; Elohim is a refuge for us. Selah.
{62:9} Sons of Aḏam are but a breath, Sons of men are a lie; If weighed in the scales, They are altogether lighter than breath.
{62:10} Do not trust in oppression. And do not become vain in robbery; If riches increase, Do not set your heart on them.
{62:11} Elohim has spoken once, Twice I have heard this: That strength belongs to Elohim.
{62:12} And loving-commitment is Yours, O יהוה; For You reward each one according to his work.
{63:1} O Elohim, You are my Ěl; I earnestly seek You; My being has thirsted for You; My flesh has longed for You In a dry and thirsty land without water.
{63:2} Therefore I have had a vision of You In the set-apart place, To see Your power and Your esteem.
{63:3} Because Your loving-commitment is better than life, My lips do praise You.
{63:4} Therefore I bless You while I live; In Your Name I lift up my hands.
{63:5} My being is satisfied as with marrow and fat, And my mouth praises You with singing lips.
{63:6} When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches.
{63:7} For You have been my help, And in the shadow of Your wings I sing.
{63:8} My being has closely followed You; Your right hand did uphold me.
{63:9} But those who seek to destroy my life, Go into the lower parts of the earth.
{63:10} They are handed over To the power of the sword; They become a portion for jackals.
{63:11} But let the sovereign rejoice in Elohim; Let everyone who swears by Him exult; For the mouth of those speaking lies is stopped.
{64:1} Hear my voice, O Elohim, in my meditation; Guard my life from the threats of the enemy.
{64:2} Hide me from the secret plans of the evil-doers, From the tumult of the workers of wickedness,
{64:3} Who sharpen their tongue like a sword, And aim their arrows, a bitter word,
{64:4} To shoot in ambush at someone blameless, They shoot at him suddenly and do not fear.
{64:5} They arm themselves with an evil word; They talk of hiding snares; They have said, “Who sees them?”
{64:6} They search out unrighteousnesses, “We have perfected a well searched out plan.” For the inward part of man, and heart, are deep.
{64:7} But Elohim does shoot at them with an arrow; Their wounds shall be sudden.
{64:8} And they cause one to stumble, Their own tongue is against them; All who see them flee away.
{64:9} And all men fear, And declare the work of Elohim. And they shall wisely consider What He has done.
{64:10} The righteous rejoice in יהוה, And shall take refuge in Him, And all the upright in heart praise Him.
{65:1} To You, stillness, praise, in Tsiyon, O Elohim; And to You a vow is paid.
{65:2} To You who hears all prayer, all flesh comes.
{65:3} Crooked matters were mightier than I; As for our transgressions, You do cover them.
{65:4} Blessed is the one You choose, And bring near to dwell in Your courts. We are satisfied with the goodness of Your house, Your set-apart Hĕḵal.
{65:5} By awesome deeds in righteousness You answer us, O Elohim of our deliverance, The Trust of all the ends of the earth, And the distant seas;
{65:6} Who established the mountains by His strength, Being girded with might;
{65:7} Who stills the roaring of the seas, The roaring of their waves, And the uproar of the peoples.
{65:8} And they who dwell in the farthest parts, Are afraid of Your signs; You make the outgoings of the morning and evening rejoice.
{65:9} You have visited the earth and watered it, You greatly enrich it; The river of Elohim is filled with water; You provide their grain, For so You have prepared it.
{65:10} Its ridges have been filled, Its furrows have been deepened, You make it soft with showers, You bless its growth.
{65:11} You have crowned the year with Your goodness, And Your paths drip with fatness.
{65:12} The pastures of the wilderness drip, And the hills are girded with rejoicing.
{65:13} The meadows are dressed in flocks, And valleys are covered with grain; They shout for joy and sing.
{66:1} Shout with joy to Elohim, All the earth!
{66:2} Sing out the splendour of His Name; Make His praise esteemed.
{66:3} Say to Elohim, “How awesome are Your works! Through the greatness of Your power Your enemies pretend obedience to You.
{66:4} All the earth bow to You, They sing praises to You, They praise Your Name. Selah.
{66:5} Come and see the works of Elohim, Awesome acts toward the sons of men.
{66:6} He has turned the sea into dry land, They went through the river on foot. There we rejoiced in Him,
{66:7} Who rules by His power forever; His eyes keeping watch on the nations; Let the rebellious not exalt themselves. Selah.
{66:8} Bless our Elohim, you peoples! And sound His praise abroad,
{66:9} Who keeps us in life, And does not allow our feet to be moved.
{66:10} For You, O Elohim, have proved us; You have refined us as silver is refined.
{66:11} You brought us into the net; You laid affliction on our loins.
{66:12} You have let men ride at our head; We went through fire and through water; But You brought us out to plenty.
{66:13} I enter Your house with ascending offerings; I complete my vows to You,
{66:14} That which my lips have uttered And my mouth spoke in my distress.
{66:15} Ascending offerings of fatlings I offer to You, With the incense of rams; I offer bulls with goats. Selah.
{66:16} Come, hear, all you who fear Elohim, And I relate what He has done for my being.
{66:17} I called to Him with my mouth, And praise was in my tongue.
{66:18} If I have seen wickedness in my heart, יהוה would not hear.
{66:19} Truly, Elohim has heard me; He has given heed to the voice of my prayer.
{66:20} Blessed be Elohim, Who has not turned away my prayer, Nor His loving-commitment from me!
{67:1} Elohim does favour us and bless us, Cause His face to shine upon us. Selah.
{67:2} For Your way to be known on earth, Your deliverance among all nations.
{67:3} Let the peoples praise You, O Elohim, Let all the peoples praise You.
{67:4} Let the nations be glad and sing for joy! For You judge the peoples uprightly, And lead the nations on earth. Selah.
{67:5} Let the peoples praise You, O Elohim; Let all the peoples praise You.
{67:6} The earth shall give her increase; Elohim, our own Elohim, blesses us!
{67:7} Elohim blesses us! And all the ends of the earth fear Him!
{68:1} Elohim arises, His enemies are scattered. And those who hate Him flee before Him!
{68:2} As smoke is driven away, You drive them away; As wax melts before the fire, The wrong perish before Elohim.
{68:3} But the righteous are glad, They exult before Elohim. And they rejoice with gladness.
{68:4} Sing to Elohim, sing praises to His Name. Raise up a highway for Him Who rides through the deserts, By His Name Yah, And exult before Him.
{68:5} Father of the fatherless, And Right-ruler of widows, Is Elohim in His set-apart dwelling.
{68:6} Elohim makes a home for the lonely; He brings out into prosperity Those who are bound with chains; Only the rebellious shall dwell in a dry land.
{68:7} O Elohim, when You went out before Your people, When You stepped through the wilderness, Selah.
{68:8} The earth shook and the heavens dropped before Elohim, This Sinai, shook before Elohim, the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl.
{68:9} You, O Elohim, sent a shower of plenty, You confirmed Your inheritance, When it was weary.
{68:10} Your flock dwelt in it; You provided from Your goodness for the poor, O Elohim.
{68:11} יהוה gave the word; The women who proclaimed it was a great company:
{68:12} Sovereigns of armies flee in haste! And she who remains at home divides the spoil.
{68:13} If you lie down among the sheepfolds, The wings of a dove are covered with silver, And her feathers with yellow gold.
{68:14} When the Almighty scattered sovereigns in it, It did snow in Tsalmon.
{68:15} A mountain of Elohim is the mountain of Bashan; A mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
{68:16} O mountain of peaks, why do you gaze in envy At the mountain which Elohim desired to dwell in; יהוה even dwells there forever.
{68:17} The chariots of Elohim are twenty thousand, Thousands of thousands; יהוה came from Sinai Into the Set-apart Place.
{68:18} You have ascended on high, You have led captivity captive, You have received gifts among men, And even the rebellious, That Yah Elohim might dwell there.
{68:19} Blessed be יהוה, Day by day He bears our burden, The Ěl of our deliverance! Selah.
{68:20} Our Ěl is the Ěl of deliverance; And to יהוה, the Master, belong escapes from death.
{68:21} Indeed, Elohim smites the head of His enemies, The hairy scalp of him who walks about in His guilt.
{68:22} יהוה said, “I bring back from Bashan, I bring back from the depths of the sea,
{68:23} So that you plunge your foot in blood; That the tongues of your dogs Have their portion from the enemies.
{68:24} They have seen Your goings, O Elohim, The goings of my Ěl, my Sovereign, Into the set-apart place.
{68:25} The singers went in front, The players on instruments after them; Among them were the young women playing tambourines.
{68:26} Bless Elohim in the assemblies, יהוה, from the fountain of Yisra’ĕl.
{68:27} There is Binyamin, the smallest, their ruler, The leaders of Yehuḏah, their company, The leader of Zeḇulun, the leader of Naphtali.
{68:28} Your Elohim has commanded your strength, be strong! O Elohim, this You have worked out for us!
{68:29} Because of Your Hĕḵal at Yerushalayim, Sovereigns bring presents to You.
{68:30} Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds, The herd of bulls, with the calves of the peoples, Each one humbling himself with pieces of silver. Scatter the peoples who delight in conflicts!
{68:31} Ambassadors come out of Mitsrayim; Kush stretches out her hands to Elohim.
{68:32} Sing to Elohim, you reigns of the earth, Praises to יהוה, Selah.
{68:33} To Him who rides on the ancient highest heavens! See, He sends out His voice, a mighty voice.
{68:34} Ascribe strength to Elohim; His excellence is over Yisra’ĕl, And His strength is in the clouds.
{68:35} O Elohim, awesome from Your set-apart places, The Ěl of Yisra’ĕl is He Who gives strength and power to His people. Blessed be Elohim!
{69:1} Save me, O Elohim! For waters have come up to my neck.
{69:2} I have sunk in deep mud, And there is no place to stand; I have come into deep waters, And the floods overflow me.
{69:3} I am worn out from my crying; My throat is dry; My eyes grow dim As I wait for my Elohim.
{69:4} Those who hate me without a cause Are more than the hairs of my head; They are mighty who would destroy me, My lying enemies; What I did not steal, I restored.
{69:5} O Elohim, You Yourself know my foolishness; And my guilt has not been hidden from You.
{69:6} Let not those who wait for You, O Master יהוה of hosts, Be ashamed because of me; Let not those who seek You Be humbled because of me, O Elohim of Yisra’ĕl.
{69:7} Because I have borne reproach for Your sake; Shame has covered my face.
{69:8} I have become a stranger to my brothers, And a foreigner to my mother’s children;
{69:9} Because ardour for Your house has eaten me up, And the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me.
{69:10} And I wept in my being with fasting, And it became my reproach.
{69:11} And when I put on sackcloth, I became a proverb to them.
{69:12} They who sit in the gate talk about me, And I am the song of the drunkards.
{69:13} But as for me, my prayer is to You, O יהוה, At an acceptable time, O Elohim. In the greatness of Your loving-commitment, Answer me in the truth of Your deliverance.
{69:14} Rescue me out of the mire, And let me not sink. Let me be rescued from those who hate me, And out of the deep waters.
{69:15} Let not a flood of waters overflow me, Nor let the deep swallow me up, Nor let the pit shut its mouth on me.
{69:16} Answer me, O יהוה, for Your loving-commitment is good. According to the greatness of Your compassion, turn to me.
{69:17} And do not hide Your face from Your servant, For I am in distress; Answer me speedily.
{69:18} Draw near to my being, redeem it; Ransom me because of my enemies.
{69:19} You Yourself know my reproach, And my shame and my confusion; My adversaries are all before You.
{69:20} Reproach has broken my heart and I am sick; I looked for sympathy, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none.
{69:21} And they gave me gall for my food, And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
{69:22} Let their table before them become a snare, And a trap to those at ease.
{69:23} Let their eyes be darkened, so as not to see; And make their loins shake continually.
{69:24} Pour out Your wrath upon them, And let Your burning displeasure overtake them.
{69:25} Let their encampments be deserted; Let no one dwell in their tents.
{69:26} For they persecute him whom You have stricken, And talk about the pain of those You have wounded.
{69:27} Add crookedness to their crookedness, And let them not enter into Your righteousness.
{69:28} Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, And not be written with the righteous.
{69:29} But I am poor and in pain; Let Your deliverance, O Elohim, set me up on high.
{69:30} I praise the Name of Elohim with a song, And I make Him great with thanksgiving.
{69:31} And this pleases יהוה more than an ox, A bull with horns and hooves.
{69:32} The humble shall see, they rejoice, You who seek Elohim, and your hearts live.
{69:33} For יהוה hears the poor, And He shall not despise His captives.
{69:34} Let the heavens and earth praise Him, The seas and all that moves in them.
{69:35} For Elohim shall save Tsiyon And build the cities of Yehuḏah. And they shall dwell there and possess it,
{69:36} And the seed of His servants inherit it, And those who love His Name dwell in it.
{70:1} O Elohim, deliver me! Hasten to my help, O יהוה!
{70:2} Let those who seek my life Be ashamed and abashed, Let those who are desiring my evil Be turned back and humiliated.
{70:3} Let those who say, “Aha, aha!” Be turned back because of their shame.
{70:4} Let all those who seek You Rejoice and be glad in You; And let those who love Your deliverance always say, “Let Elohim be made great!”
{70:5} But I am poor and needy; Hasten to me, O Elohim! You are my help and my deliverer; O יהוה, do not delay.
{71:1} In You, O יהוה, I have taken refuge; Let me never be ashamed.
{71:2} In Your righteousness deliver and rescue me; Incline Your ear to me, and save me.
{71:3} Be to me a rock to dwell in, To go into continually. You have given the command to save me, For You are my rock and my stronghold.
{71:4} Rescue me, O my Elohim, Out of the hand of the wrong, Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel.
{71:5} For You are my expectation, Master יהוה, my Trust from my youth.
{71:6} Upon You I have leaned from my birth; You took me out of my mother’s womb. My praise is continually of You.
{71:7} I have become as a wonder to many, But You are my strong refuge.
{71:8} My mouth is filled with Your praise, Your splendour, all the day.
{71:9} Do not cast me off in the time of old age, When my strength fails, do not forsake me.
{71:10} For my enemies have spoken against me. And those who watch for my life Have taken counsel together,
{71:11} Saying, “Elohim has forsaken him; Pursue and take him, for there is no one to deliver.”
{71:12} O Elohim, do not be far from me; My Elohim, hasten to my help!
{71:13} Let those who are adversaries of my life Be ashamed, consumed, Let those who seek my evil Be covered with reproach and confusion.
{71:14} But I continually wait, And shall praise You more and more.
{71:15} My mouth recounts Your righteousness Your deliverance all the day, Though I do not know their numbers.
{71:16} I come in the might of the Master יהוה; I make mention of Your righteousness, Yours alone.
{71:17} Elohim, You have taught me from my youth; And to this day I declare Your wonders.
{71:18} And also when I am old and grey, O Elohim, do not forsake me, Until I declare Your strength to a generation, Your might to all those who are to come.
{71:19} For Your righteousness, O Elohim, is very high, You who have done great deeds. O Elohim, who is like You?
{71:20} You who have shown me great and evil distresses, Revive me again and bring me up again From the depths of the earth.
{71:21} You increase my greatness, And comfort me on every side.
{71:22} Also with the lyre I praise You For Your trustworthiness, O my Elohim! I sing to You with the lyre, O Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl.
{71:23} My lips shout for joy when I sing to You, Even my being, which You have redeemed.
{71:24} My tongue, too, utters Your righteousness all day long; For those who have been seeking my evil Have been put to shame, Have become abashed.
{72:1} O Elohim, give the sovereign Your right-rulings, And Your righteousness to the Son of a sovereign.
{72:2} Let Him rule Your people with righteousness, And Your poor with right-ruling.
{72:3} Let the mountains bring peace to the people, And the hills, by righteousness.
{72:4} Let Him rightly rule the poor of the people, Save the children of the needy, And crush the oppressor.
{72:5} Let them fear You with the sun, shining And before the moon, in all generations.
{72:6} Let Him come down like rain upon the mown grass, Like showers, watering the earth.
{72:7} Let the righteous flourish in His days, With plenty of peace, Till the moon is no more.
{72:8} And let Him rule from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.
{72:9} Let those dwelling in the desert bow before Him, And His enemies lick the dust.
{72:10} Let the sovereigns of Tarshish and of the isles bring presents; The sovereigns of Sheḇa and Seḇa offer gifts.
{72:11} And let all sovereigns bow down before Him, All nations serve Him.
{72:12} For He delivers the needy when he cries, And the poor, who has no helper.
{72:13} He spares the poor and needy, And He saves the lives of the needy.
{72:14} He redeems their life from oppression and from violence; And their blood is precious in His eyes.
{72:15} And He shall live, And the gold of Sheḇa be given to Him, And prayer be made for Him continually; Let Him be blessed all day long.
{72:16} Let there be plenty of grain in the earth, On the top of the mountains, Let its fruit wave like Leḇanon, And those of the city flourish like grass of the earth.
{72:17} Let His Name be forever, His Name continue before the sun; And let them bless themselves in Him; Let all nations call Him blessed.
{72:18} Blessed be יהוה Elohim, Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, He alone is doing wonders!
{72:19} And blessed be His esteemed Name forever! And let all the earth Be filled with His esteem. Amĕn and Amĕn.
{72:20} The prayers of Dawiḏ the son of Yishai are ended.
{73:1} Elohim is truly good to Yisra’ĕl, To those whose heart is clean.
{73:2} But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled, My steps had nearly slipped.
{73:3} For I was envious of the boasters, When I saw the peace of the wrong-doers.
{73:4} For death has no pangs for them, And their strength is firm.
{73:5} They are not in trouble as other men, And they are not plagued like other men.
{73:6} So pride is their necklace, The garment of violence covers them.
{73:7} Their eyes bulge from fatness; Their heart overflows with imaginations.
{73:8} They mock and speak in the evil of oppression; They speak loftily.
{73:9} They have set their mouth against the heavens, And their tongue walks through the earth, saying:
{73:10} Therefore His people return here, And waters of a filled cup are drained by them!”
{73:11} And they have said, “How could Ěl know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?”
{73:12} See, these are the wrong, And always at ease, They have amassed wealth!
{73:13} Indeed, in vain have I cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocence.
{73:14} For I am plagued all day long, And my reproof is every morning.
{73:15} If I had said, “Let me speak thus,” See, I would have deceived A generation of Your children.
{73:16} Yet, when I tried to understand this, It was labour to my eyes –
{73:17} Until I went into the set-apart place of Ěl; Then I perceived their end.
{73:18} Indeed, You set them in slippery places; You make them fall to ruins.
{73:19} How suddenly they are ruined! Completely swept away through destructions.
{73:20} יהוה, when You awake You despise their image, As one does a dream after waking.
{73:21} For my heart was in a ferment, And I was pierced in my kidneys.
{73:22} I was stupid and ignorant, I was like a beast toward You.
{73:23} Yet I am always with You, You took hold of my right hand.
{73:24} You lead me by Your counsel, And afterward receive me unto esteem.
{73:25} Whom do I have in the heavens? And I have desired no one besides You on earth.
{73:26} My flesh and my heart shall waste away, But Elohim is the rock of my heart And my portion forever.
{73:27} For look, those who are far from You perish; You shall cut off all those Who go whoring away from You.
{73:28} But as for me, it is good to be near Elohim. I have made my refuge in the Master יהוה, To declare all Your works.
{74:1} O Elohim, why do You forever reject us? Why does Your displeasure smoke Against the sheep of Your pasture?
{74:2} Remember Your congregation. You did purchase of old, The tribe of Your inheritance. You did redeem, This Mount Tsiyon where You have dwelt.
{74:3} Lift up Your steps to the endless ruins; The enemy has done all evil in the set-apart place.
{74:4} Your adversaries have roared In the midst of Your appointments; They have set up their own signs as signs.
{74:5} It seems as if one had lifted up Axes among the thick trees.
{74:6} And now all its carved work, They have broken down with axe and hammer.
{74:7} They have set fire to Your set-apart place, They have profaned the dwelling place of Your Name to the ground.
{74:8} They said in their hearts, “Let us suppress them altogether.” They burned all the Appointment Places of Ěl in the land.
{74:9} We do not see our signs, There is no longer a prophet, Nor any among us who knows how long.
{74:10} O Elohim, how long would the adversary reproach? Would the enemy despise Your Name forever?
{74:11} Why do You hold back Your hand, even Your right hand? From the midst of Your bosom – end it!
{74:12} For Elohim is my Sovereign from of old, Working deliverance in the midst of the earth.
{74:13} You divided the sea by Your might; You broke the heads of the sea serpents in the waters.
{74:14} You broke the heads of Liwiathan in pieces, You made him food for the people Living in the wilderness.
{74:15} You did cleave open the fountain and the flood, You did dry up mighty rivers.
{74:16} The day is Yours, the night is Yours too, You have established the light and the sun.
{74:17} You have set all the borders of the earth, You have made summer and winter.
{74:18} Remember this: the enemy has reproached יהוה, And a foolish people has despised Your Name.
{74:19} Do not give the being of Your turtledove to the wild beast! Do not forget the life of Your afflicted ones forever.
{74:20} Look to the covenant, For the dark places of the earth are filled With haunts of violence.
{74:21} Let not the crushed one return ashamed! Let the poor and needy praise Your Name.
{74:22} Arise, O Elohim, plead Your own cause, Remember how the foolish man reproaches You daily.
{74:23} Do not forget the voice of Your enemies, The uproar of those rising up against You increases continually.
{75:1} We shall give thanks to You, O Elohim, we shall give thanks! And Your Name is near! Your wonders shall be declared!
{75:2} “When I seize the appointed time, It is I who judge in uprightness.
{75:3} The earth and all its inhabitants are melted; It is I who set its columns firm. Selah.”
{75:4} “I said to the boasters, ‘Do not boast,’ And to the wrong, ‘Do not lift up the horn.
{75:5} “Do not lift up your horn on high (You speak with a stiff neck).’”
{75:6} For exaltations are neither from the east, Nor from the west nor from the wilderness.
{75:7} But Elohim is the Judge – He puts down one, And exalts another.
{75:8} For a cup is in the hand of יהוה, And the wine shall foam; It is filled with a mixture, And He pours it out. All the wrong of the earth drink, Draining it to the dregs.
{75:9} But I, I declare forever, I sing praises to the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.
{75:10} And all the horns of the wrong I cut off; The horns of the righteous are lifted up.
{76:1} In Yehuḏah Elohim is known; His Name is great in Yisra’ĕl.
{76:2} And His booth is in Shalĕm, And His dwelling place in Tsiyon.
{76:3} There He broke the arrows of the bow, The shield and the sword and the battle-axe. Selah.
{76:4} You are resplendent, More excellent than mountains of prey.
{76:5} The stout-hearted have been stripped; They slept their sleep; And none of the mighty men have found their hands.
{76:6} At Your rebuke, O Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ, Both the rider and horse lay stunned.
{76:7} You, You are to be feared; And who would stand in Your presence When You are displeased?
{76:8} From heaven You shall cause judgment to be heard; The earth shall fear, and shall be still,
{76:9} When Elohim arises to right-ruling, To save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
{76:10} For the wrath of mankind praises You, With the remainder of wrath You gird Yourself!
{76:11} Make vows to יהוה your Elohim, and pay them. Let all who are around Him bring presents To the One to be feared.
{76:12} He cuts off the spirit of leaders, He is awesome to the sovereigns of the earth!
{77:1} My voice is to Elohim, and I cry; My voice is to Elohim, and He listened to me.
{77:2} In the day of my distress I sought יהוה; My hand was stretched out in the night And it did not cease, My being refused to be comforted.
{77:3} I remembered Elohim, and groaned; I complained, and my spirit grew faint. Selah.
{77:4} You ceased the watches of my eyes, I was too troubled to speak.
{77:5} I have thought about the days of old, The years long past.
{77:6} I remember my song in the night, I meditate within my heart, And my spirit searches diligently.
{77:7} Would יהוה reject forever, And never again be pleased?
{77:8} Has His loving-commitment ceased forever, Has the promise failed for all generations?
{77:9} Has Ěl forgotten to show favour? Has He shut up His compassions in displeasure? Selah.
{77:10} And I said, “This is my grief: That the right hand of the Most High has changed.”
{77:11} I remember the deeds of Yah, For I remember Your wonders of old.
{77:12} And I shall meditate on all Your work, And talk of Your deeds.
{77:13} Your way, O Elohim, is in Set-apartness; Who is a great Ěl like Elohim?
{77:14} You are the Ěl who does wonders; You have made known Your strength among the peoples.
{77:15} By Your arm You have redeemed Your people, The sons of Ya‛aqoḇ and Yosĕph. Selah.
{77:16} The waters saw You, O Elohim; The waters saw You, they were afraid; The depths also trembled.
{77:17} The clouds poured out water; The heavens rumbled; Also, Your arrows flashed back and forth.
{77:18} The voice of Your thunder rolled along; Lightnings lit up the world; The earth trembled and shook.
{77:19} Your way was in the sea, And Your path in the great waters, And Your footsteps were not known.
{77:20} You did lead Your people like a flock By the hand of Mosheh and Aharon.
{78:1} My people, give ear to my Torah, Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
{78:2} I open my mouth in a parable; I utter riddles of old,
{78:3} Which we have heard and known, For our fathers have related them to us.
{78:4} We do not hide them from their children, Relating to the generation to come the praises of יהוה, And His strength and His wonders which He has done.
{78:5} For He raised a witness in Ya‛aqoḇ, And set a Torah in Yisra’ĕl, Which He commanded our fathers, To teach them to their children;
{78:6} That it might be known to a generation to come, To children who would be born, To rise up and relate them to their children,
{78:7} And place their trust in Elohim, And not forget the works of Ěl, But watch over His commands,
{78:8} And not be like their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation which did not prepare its heart, Whose spirit was not steadfast to Ěl.
{78:9} The children of Ephrayim, armed bowmen, Turned back in the day of battle.
{78:10} They did not guard the covenant of Elohim, And they refused to walk in His Torah,
{78:11} And they forgot His deeds And His wonders which He had shown them.
{78:12} He did wonders in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Mitsrayim, in the field of Tso‛an.
{78:13} He split the sea and caused them to pass through, And He made the waters stand up like a heap,
{78:14} And led them with the cloud by day, And all the night with a light of fire.
{78:15} He split the rocks in the wilderness, And made them drink, as from the great depths,
{78:16} And brought forth streams from the rock, And caused waters to come down as rivers.
{78:17} Yet they sinned still more against Him To rebel against the Most High in the desert.
{78:18} And they tried Ěl in their heart By asking food according to their desire.
{78:19} And they spoke against Elohim. They said, “Is Ěl able to set a table in the wilderness?
{78:20} Look, He struck the rock, So that the waters gushed out, And the streams overflowed. Is He able to give bread also? Would He provide meat for His people?
{78:21} Therefore יהוה heard, and He was wroth; So a fire was kindled against Ya‛aqoḇ, And displeasure also came up against Yisra’ĕl,
{78:22} Because they did not believe in Elohim, Neither did they trust in His deliverance.
{78:23} Yet He had commanded the clouds above, And opened the doors of the heavens,
{78:24} And He rained down manna on them to eat, And He gave them the grain of the heavens.
{78:25} Men ate bread of the mighty; He sent them provisions to satisfaction.
{78:26} He made an east wind blow in the heavens; And by His power He brought in the south wind.
{78:27} And He rained meat on them like the dust, And winged birds like the sand of the seas,
{78:28} And let them fall in the midst of His camp, All around His Dwelling Place.
{78:29} So they ate and were completely satisfied, For He brought them what they desired.
{78:30} They had not turned away from their desire, Their food was still in their mouths,
{78:31} When the wrath of Elohim came against them, And He killed among their fat ones, And He struck down the choice ones of Yisra’ĕl.
{78:32} In spite of all this they still sinned, And did not believe in His wonders.
{78:33} So He ended their days in a breath, And their years in trouble.
{78:34} When He killed them, then they sought Him, And they returned and did earnestly seek Ěl.
{78:35} And they remembered that Elohim was their rock, And the Most High Ěl their redeemer.
{78:36} But they flattered Him with their mouth, And they lied to Him with their tongue,
{78:37} For their heart was not steadfast with Him, And they were not true to His covenant.
{78:38} But He, the Compassionate One, Pardoned crookedness, And did not destroy them. And many a time He turned His displeasure away, And did not stir up all His wrath.
{78:39} For He remembered that they were but flesh, A passing breath that does not return.
{78:40} How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness, And grieved Him in the desert!
{78:41} And again and again they tried Ěl, And provoked the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl.
{78:42} They did not remember His hand, The day when He redeemed them from the adversary,
{78:43} How He worked His signs in Mitsrayim, And His wonders in the field of Tso‛an.
{78:44} He turned their rivers into blood, And they could not drink their streams.
{78:45} He sent among them swarms of flies which devoured them, And frogs which destroyed them,
{78:46} And gave their crops to the caterpillar, And their labour to the locust.
{78:47} He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycamore trees with frost,
{78:48} And gave their beasts over to the hail, And their livestock to bolts of fire.
{78:49} He sent on them the burning of His displeasure, Wrath, and rage, and distress, A deputation of messengers of evils.
{78:50} He made a path for His displeasure; He did not spare their being from death, But gave their life over to the plague.
{78:51} And He struck all the first-born in Mitsrayim, The first-fruits of strength in the tents of Ḥam,
{78:52} Then made His own people go forth like sheep, And led them in the wilderness like a flock.
{78:53} And He led them on safely, And they did not fear, But the sea covered their enemies.
{78:54} And He brought them to the border of His set-apart place, This mountain which His right hand had gained,
{78:55} And drove out nations before them, And allotted them a measured inheritance, And made the tribes of Yisra’ĕl dwell in their tents.
{78:56} Yet they tried and rebelled Against the Most High Elohim, And did not guard His witnesses,
{78:57} But they turned back And acted treacherously like their fathers; They twisted like a treacherous bow.
{78:58} For they enraged Him with their high places, And moved Him to jealousy with their carved images.
{78:59} When Elohim heard this, He was wroth, And greatly despised Yisra’ĕl,
{78:60} And He left the Dwelling Place of Shiloh, The Tent which He had set up among men.
{78:61} And He gave His strength into captivity, And His comeliness into the hand of the adversary.
{78:62} And He gave His people over to the sword, And He was wroth with His inheritance.
{78:63} His young men were consumed by fire, And His maidens were not praised.
{78:64} His priests fell by the sword, And their widows could not weep.
{78:65} Then יהוה awoke as one asleep, As a mighty man who shouts because of wine.
{78:66} And He struck His adversaries backward, He put them to an everlasting reproach.
{78:67} Then He rejected the tent of Yosĕph, And did not choose the tribe of Ephrayim,
{78:68} But chose the tribe of Yehuḏah, Mount Tsiyon, which He loved.
{78:69} And He built His set-apart place like the heights, Like the earth He founded it forever.
{78:70} And He chose Dawiḏ His servant, And took him from the sheepfolds;
{78:71} He brought him in from tending the ewes, To shepherd Ya‛aqoḇ His people, And Yisra’ĕl His inheritance.
{78:72} And he shepherded them According to the integrity of his heart, And led them by the skill of his hands.
{79:1} O Elohim, the nations have come into Your inheritance; They have defiled Your set-apart Hĕḵal; They turned Yerushalayim into ruins.
{79:2} They have given the dead bodies of Your servants As food for the birds of the heavens, The flesh of Your lovingly-committed ones to the wild beast of the earth.
{79:3} They have poured out their blood Like water all around Yerushalayim, With no one to bury them.
{79:4} We have become a reproach to our neighbours, A scorn and a mockery to those who are around us.
{79:5} How long, O יהוה, Would You be enraged forever? Would Your jealousy burn like fire?
{79:6} Pour out Your wrath on the nations Who have not known You, And on reigns that have not called on Your Name.
{79:7} For they have devoured Ya‛aqoḇ, And laid waste his pasture.
{79:8} Do not remember against us The crookednesses of the fathers! Let Your compassion speedily meet us, For we have been greatly weakened.
{79:9} Help us, O Elohim of our deliverance, For the sake of the esteem of Your Name. And deliver us, and cover over our sins, For Your Name’s sake!
{79:10} Why should the nations say, “Where is their Elohim?” Let the vengeance of the outpoured blood of Your servants Be known among the nations, Before our eyes.
{79:11} Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You. According to the greatness of Your arm Preserve those appointed to death.
{79:12} And repay to our neighbours sevenfold Their reproach, into their bosom, With which they have reproached You, O יהוה.
{79:13} And we, Your people and the sheep of Your pasture, We give thanks to You forever; From generation to generation we show forth Your praise.
{80:1} Give ear, O Shepherd of Yisra’ĕl, Who leads Yosĕph like a flock; Who dwells between the keruḇim, shine forth!
{80:2} Before Ephrayim, Binyamin, and Menashsheh, Stir up Your might, And come and save us!
{80:3} Cause us to turn back, O Elohim, And cause Your face to shine, That we might be saved!
{80:4} O יהוה Elohim of hosts, How long shall You be wroth Against the prayer of Your people?
{80:5} You have caused them to eat the bread of tears, And have caused them to drink With tears, a third time.
{80:6} You have made us a strife to our neighbours, And our enemies laugh among themselves.
{80:7} Turn us back, O Elohim of hosts, And cause Your face to shine, That we might be saved!
{80:8} You brought a vine out of Mitsrayim; You drove out the nations, and planted it.
{80:9} You cleared a place for it, And caused it to take deep root, And it filled the land.
{80:10} Hills were covered with its shadow, And the mighty cedars with its twigs.
{80:11} She spread her branches to the Sea, And her shoots to the River.
{80:12} Why have You broken down her hedges, So that every passer-by plucked her fruit?
{80:13} The boar out of the forest ravages it, And the wild beast of the field devours it.
{80:14} Return, we beg You, O Elohim of hosts; Look down from heaven, and see, And visit this vine,
{80:15} And the stock which Your right hand has planted, And the Son whom You made strong for Yourself.
{80:16} It is burned with fire, it is cut down; They perish at the rebuke of Your face.
{80:17} Let Your hand be upon the One at Your right hand, Upon the Son of Aḏam whom You made strong for Yourself,
{80:18} And we shall not backslide from You. Revive us, and let us call upon Your Name.
{80:19} Turn us back, O יהוה Elohim of hosts, And cause Your face to shine, That we might be saved!
{81:1} Shout for joy to Elohim our strength; Raise a shout to the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.
{81:2} Lift up a song and beat the tambourine, The pleasant lyre and with the harp.
{81:3} Blow a shophar in the New Moon, in the covering for the day of our festival.
{81:4} For this is a law for Yisra’ĕl, And a right-ruling of the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ.
{81:5} He appointed it in Yehosĕph for a witness, When He went throughout the land of Mitsrayim; I heard a language that I did not know.
{81:6} He says, “I removed his shoulder from the burden; His hands were freed from the baskets.
{81:7} “You called in distress, and I rescued you; I answered you in the covering of thunder; I proved you at the waters of Meriḇah. Selah.
{81:8} Hear, O My people, and let Me warn you, O Yisra’ĕl, if you would listen to Me!”
{81:9} “Let there be no strange mighty one among you, And do not bow down to a foreign mighty one.
{81:10} I am יהוה your Elohim, Who brought you out of the land of Mitsrayim; Open your mouth wide, and I fill it.”
{81:11} “But My people did not listen to My voice, And Yisra’ĕl would not submit to Me.
{81:12} So I gave them over to their own stubborn heart, To walk in their own counsels.”
{81:13} “O, if My people had listened to Me, Yisra’ĕl would walk in My ways,
{81:14} I would subdue their enemies at once, And turn My hand against their adversaries!”
{81:15} Those who hate יהוה would cringe before Him; And their time of punishment be forever.
{81:16} He would feed them with the finest of wheat; And with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.
{82:1} Elohim stands in the congregation of Ěl; He judges in the midst of the elohim.
{82:2} How long would you judge perversely, And show partiality to the wrong? Selah.
{82:3} Give right-ruling to the poor and fatherless, Do right to the afflicted and needy.
{82:4} Rescue the poor and needy; Deliver them from the hand of the wrong.
{82:5} They do not know, nor do they understand, They walk about in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
{82:6} I, I said, “You are elohim, And all of you are sons of the Most High.
{82:7} But as men you die, And fall as one of the heads.
{82:8} Arise, O Elohim, judge the earth, For You shall possess all the nations.
{83:1} O Elohim, do not remain silent! Do not be speechless, And do not be still, O Ěl!
{83:2} For look, Your enemies make an uproar, And those hating You have lifted up their head.
{83:3} They craftily plot against Your people, And conspire against Your treasured ones.
{83:4} They have said, “Come, And let us wipe them out as a nation, And let the name of Yisra’ĕl be remembered no more.”
{83:5} For they have conspired together with one heart; They have made a covenant against You –
{83:6} The tents of Eḏom and the Yishma‛ĕlites, Mo’aḇ and the Haḡarites,
{83:7} Geḇal, and Ammon, and Amalĕq, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tsor,
{83:8} Ashshur also has joined with them, They have helped the children of Lot. Selah.
{83:9} Do to them as to Miḏyan, As to Sisera, As to Yaḇin at the wadi Qishon,
{83:10} Who perished at Ěndor, Who became as dung for the ground.
{83:11} Make their nobles like Orĕḇ and like Ze’ĕḇ, And all their princes like Zeḇaḥ and Tsalmunna,
{83:12} Who have said, “Let us take possession of the pastures of Elohim For ourselves.”
{83:13} O my Elohim, make them as whirling dust, As stubble before the wind!
{83:14} As a fire consumes a forest, And as a flame sets mountains on fire,
{83:15} So pursue them with Your whirlwind, And frighten them with Your storm.
{83:16} Fill their faces with shame, And let them seek Your Name, O יהוה.
{83:17} Let them be ashamed and alarmed forever; And let them become abashed and perish,
{83:18} And let them know that You, Whose Name is יהוה, You alone are the Most High over all the earth.
{84:1} How lovely are Your dwelling places, O יהוה of hosts!
{84:2} My being has longed, and even fainted, For the courts of יהוה; My heart and my flesh cry out for the living Ěl.
{84:3} Even the sparrow has found a home, And the swallow a nest for herself, Where she has put her young ones – Your slaughter-places, O יהוה of hosts, My Sovereign and my Elohim.
{84:4} Blessed are those who dwell in Your house, They are ever praising You. Selah.
{84:5} Blessed is the man whose strength is in You, Your Highways are in their heart.
{84:6} Passing through the valley of weeping, They make it a fountain; The Teacher also covers it with blessings.
{84:7} They go from strength to strength, Appearing before Elohim in Tsiyon.
{84:8} O יהוה Elohim of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ! Selah.
{84:9} O Elohim, see our shield, And look upon the face of Your anointed.
{84:10} For a day in Your courts Is better than a thousand days. I have chosen rather to be a doorkeeper In the House of my Elohim, Than to dwell in the tents of the wrong.
{84:11} For יהוה Elohim is a sun and a shield; יהוה gives favour and esteem; He withholds no good matter From those who walk blamelessly.
{84:12} O יהוה of hosts, Blessed is the man who trusts in You!
{85:1} יהוה, You shall take pleasure in Your land; You shall turn back the captivity of Ya‛aqoḇ.
{85:2} You shall take away the crookedness of Your people; You shall cover all their sin. Selah.
{85:3} You shall withdraw all Your wrath; You shall turn from Your fierce displeasure.
{85:4} Turn back to us, O Elohim of our deliverance, And cause Your vexation toward us to cease.
{85:5} Would You be enraged with us forever? Would You draw out Your displeasure From generation to generation?
{85:6} Would You not revive us again, For Your people to rejoice in You?
{85:7} Show us Your loving-commitment, O יהוה, And give us Your deliverance.
{85:8} Let me hear what Ěl יהוה speaks, For He speaks peace to His people And to His lovingly-committed ones; And let them not turn again to folly.
{85:9} Truly, His deliverance is near to those who fear Him, For esteem to dwell in our land.
{85:10} Loving-commitment and truth shall meet, Righteousness and peace shall kiss.
{85:11} Truth sprouts forth from the earth, And righteousness looks down from heaven,
{85:12} Indeed, יהוה gives what is good, And our land yields its increase.
{85:13} Righteousness goes before Him, And prepares a way for His footsteps.
{86:1} Incline Your ear, O יהוה, Answer me, for I am poor and needy.
{86:2} Guard my being, for I am lovingly-committed; You are my Elohim; Save Your servant who is trusting in You!
{86:3} Show favour to me, O יהוה, For I cry to You all day long.
{86:4} Bring joy to the being of Your servant, For to You, O יהוה, I lift up my being.
{86:5} For You, יהוה, are good, and ready to forgive, And great in loving-commitment to all those who call upon You.
{86:6} Give ear, O יהוה, to my prayer; And listen to the voice of my pleadings.
{86:7} In the day of my distress I call upon You, For You answer me.
{86:8} There is none like You among the mighty ones, O יהוה; And like Your works there are none.
{86:9} Let all nations You have made Come and bow themselves before You, O יהוה, And give esteem to Your Name.
{86:10} For You are great, and are doing wonders; You are Elohim, You alone.
{86:11} Teach me Your way, O יהוה; Let me walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your Name.
{86:12} I praise You, O יהוה my Elohim, with all my heart, And I esteem Your Name forever.
{86:13} For Your loving-commitment is great toward me, And You have delivered my being From the depths of She’ol.
{86:14} O Elohim, the proud have risen against me, And a band of dreaded men have sought my life, And have not set You before them.
{86:15} But You, O יהוה, Are a compassionate Ěl and showing favour, Patient and great in loving-commitment and truth.
{86:16} Turn to me, and show favour to me! Give Your strength to Your servant, And save the son of Your female servant.
{86:17} Show me a sign for good, And let those hating me see it and be ashamed, For You, יהוה, have helped me and comforted me.
{87:1} His foundation is In the set-apart mountains.
{87:2} יהוה loves the gates of Tsiyon More than all the dwellings of Ya‛aqoḇ.
{87:3} Esteemed matters are spoken of you, O city of Elohim: Selah.
{87:4} I mention Rahaḇ and Baḇel to those who know Me; See, O Philistia and Tsor, with Kush, ‘This and that one was born there.’
{87:5} And of Tsiyon it is said, “Each one was born in her; For the Most High Himself does establish her.”
{87:6} יהוה does write, In the register of the peoples, “This one was born there.” Selah.
{87:7} And the singers and the players on instruments – All my fountains, are in you.
{88:1} O יהוה, Elohim of my deliverance, By day I have cried out, In the night also before You,
{88:2} Let my prayer come before You, Incline Your ear to my cry.
{88:3} For my being is filled with evils, And my life draws near to She’ol.
{88:4} I have been reckoned among those Who go down to the pit; I have become like a man Who has no strength,
{88:5} Released among the dead, Like slain ones lying in the burial-site, Whom You have remembered no more, And who have been cut off from Your hand.
{88:6} You have put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in the depths.
{88:7} Your wrath has rested heavily upon me, And You have afflicted me with all Your breakers. Selah.
{88:8} You have put away my friends far from me; You have made me an abomination to them; I am shut in and do not go out;
{88:9} My eye grows dim because of affliction. יהוה, I have called upon You, all day long; I have stretched out my hands to You.
{88:10} Would You work wonders for the dead? Would the dead rise to praise You? Selah.
{88:11} Is Your loving-commitment declared in the burial-site? Your trustworthiness in the place of destruction?
{88:12} Are Your wonders known in the dark? And Your righteousness in the land of no remembrance?
{88:13} But I, unto You I have cried, O יהוה, And in the morning my prayer comes before You.
{88:14} יהוה, why do You reject me? Why do You hide Your face from me?
{88:15} I am afflicted and dying from childhood; I have borne frightening matters from You; I am in despair.
{88:16} Your fierce wrath has gone over me; Your onslaughts have cut me off.
{88:17} They surrounded me like water all day long; They close in upon me altogether.
{88:18} You have put loved one and companion far from me, Darkness is my close friend!
{89:1} I sing of the loving-commitment of יהוה forever; With my mouth I make known Your trustworthiness To all generations.
{89:2} For I said, “Loving-commitment is built up forever; You establish Your trustworthiness in the heavens.”
{89:3} You said, “I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn to My servant Dawiḏ:
{89:4} I establish your seed forever, And shall build up your throne to all generations.’” Selah.
{89:5} And the heavens praise Your wonders, O יהוה, Your trustworthiness, too, In the assembly of the set-apart ones.
{89:6} For who in the heavens is comparable to יהוה? Who among the sons of the mighty is like יהוה?
{89:7} Ěl is greatly feared In the company of the set-apart ones, And awesome above all those around Him.
{89:8} O יהוה Elohim of hosts, Who is mighty like You, O Yah? And Your trustworthiness is all around You.
{89:9} You rule the swelling of the sea; When its waves rise, You still them.
{89:10} You have broken Rahaḇ in pieces, as one who is slain; You have scattered Your enemies With the arm of Your strength.
{89:11} The heavens are Yours, The earth also is Yours; The world and all that fills it. You have founded them.
{89:12} North and south – You have created them; Taḇor and Ḥermon rejoice in Your Name.
{89:13} You have a mighty arm, Your hand is strong, Your right hand exalted.
{89:14} Righteousness and right-ruling Are the foundation of Your throne; Loving-commitment and truth go before Your face.
{89:15} Blessed are the people Who know the sounding! They walk, O יהוה, in the light of Your face.
{89:16} In Your Name they rejoice all day long, And they are exalted in Your righteousness.
{89:17} For You are the comeliness of their strength, And by Your good pleasure our horn is exalted.
{89:18} For יהוה is our shield, And the Set-apart One of Yisra’ĕl is our Sovereign.
{89:19} Then You spoke in a vision to Your lovingly-committed one, And You said, “I have given help to one who is mighty, I have exalted one chosen from the people.
{89:20} “I have found My servant Dawiḏ; With My set-apart oil I anointed him,
{89:21} With whom My hand is established; My arm also strengthens him.”
{89:22} “No enemy subjects him to tribute, And no son of wickedness afflicts him.
{89:23} And I shall beat down His adversaries before his face, And plague those who hate him.”
{89:24} “But My trustworthiness And My loving-commitment are with him, And in My Name his horn is exalted.
{89:25} And I shall set his hand on the sea, And his right hand on the rivers.”
{89:26} “He calls out to Me, ‘You are my Father, My Ěl, and the rock of my deliverance.’
{89:27} I also appoint him first-born, Highest of the sovereigns of the earth.”
{89:28} “I guard My loving-commitment for him forever, And My covenant is steadfast with him.
{89:29} And I shall establish his seed forever, And his throne as the days of the heavens.”
{89:30} “If his sons forsake My Torah And do not walk in My right-rulings,
{89:31} If they profane My laws And do not guard My commands,”
{89:32} “Then I shall visit their transgression with the rod, And their crookedness with flogging.
{89:33} But My loving-commitment I do not take away from him, Nor be false to My trustworthiness.”
{89:34} “I shall not profane My covenant, Neither would I change what has gone out from My lips.
{89:35} Once I have sworn by My set-apartness, I do not lie to Dawiḏ:"
{89:36} “His seed shall be forever, And his throne as the sun before Me;
{89:37} “Like the moon, it is established forever, And the witness in the heaven is steadfast.” Selah.
{89:38} Yet You have rejected and spurned, You have been wroth with Your anointed.
{89:39} You have disowned the covenant of Your servant, You have defiled his diadem in the dust.
{89:40} You have broken down all his hedges, You have brought his strongholds to ruin.
{89:41} All who pass by the way plunder him; He is a reproach to his neighbours.
{89:42} You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries, You have made all his enemies rejoice.
{89:43} Moreover You have turned back the edge of his sword, And have not made him stand in battle.
{89:44} You have brought an end to his splendour, And have hurled his throne to the ground.
{89:45} You have shortened the days of his youth, You have covered him with shame. Selah.
{89:46} How long, O יהוה, would You be hidden? Would Your wrath burn like fire forever?
{89:47} Please remember how short my time is; Why should you have created all the sons of men for naught?
{89:48} What man would live and not see death? Who rescues his life from the power of She’ol? Selah.
{89:49} יהוה, where are Your former loving-commitments, Which You swore to Dawiḏ in Your trustworthiness?
{89:50} יהוה, remember the reproach of Your servants, That I have borne in my bosom – Of all the many peoples,
{89:51} With which Your enemies have reproached, O יהוה, With which they have reproached the footsteps of Your anointed.
{89:52} Blessed be יהוה forever! Amĕn and Amĕn.
{90:1} יהוה, You have been our refuge In all generations.
{90:2} Before the mountains were born, Or You had brought forth the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting You are Ěl.
{90:3} You turn man back to dust, And say, “Return, O children of men.”
{90:4} For a thousand years in Your eyes Are like yesterday that has past, Or like a watch in the night.
{90:5} You have swept them away, They are as a sleep, Like grass that springs up in the morning.
{90:6} In the morning it flourishes and springs up, At evening it is cut down and withered.
{90:7} For we have been consumed by Your displeasure, And by Your wrath we are alarmed.
{90:8} You have set our crookednesses before You, Our secret sin in the light of Your face.
{90:9} For all our days have passed away in Your wrath, We spend our years like a whisper.
{90:10} The days of our lives are seventy years; Or if due to strength, eighty years, Yet the best of them is but toil and exertion; For it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
{90:11} Who knows the power of Your displeasure? And your wrath, according to the fear of You?
{90:12} Teach us to number our days, And let us bring the heart to wisdom.
{90:13} Return, O יהוה! How long? And be sorry for Your servants.
{90:14} Satisfy us in the morning with Your loving-commitment, And let us sing for joy all our days!
{90:15} Give us joy according to The days You have afflicted us, The years we have seen evil.
{90:16} Reveal Your work to Your servants, And Your splendour to their children.
{90:17} And let the pleasantness Of יהוה our Elohim be upon us, And confirm the work of our hands for us; O confirm the work of our hands!
{91:1} He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High, Who abides under the shadow of the Almighty,
{91:2} He is saying of יהוה, “My refuge and my stronghold, My Elohim, in whom I trust!”
{91:3} For He delivers you from the snare of a trapper, From the destructive pestilence.
{91:4} He covers you with His feathers, And under His wings you take refuge; His truth is a shield and armour.
{91:5} You are not afraid of the dread by night, Of the arrow that flies by day,
{91:6} Of the pestilence that walks in darkness, Of destruction that ravages at midday.
{91:7} A thousand fall at your side, And ten thousand at your right hand; But it does not come near you.
{91:8} Only with your eyes you look on, And see the reward of the wrong ones.
{91:9} Because you have made יהוה – My refuge, the Most High – your dwelling place,
{91:10} No evil befalls you, And a plague does not come near your tent;
{91:11} For He commands His messengers concerning you, To guard you in all your ways.
{91:12} They bear you up in their hands, Lest you dash your foot against a stone.
{91:13} You tread upon lion and cobra, Young lion and serpent you trample under foot.
{91:14} “Because he cleaves to Me in love, Therefore I deliver him; I set him on high, Because he has known My Name.
{91:15} When he calls on Me, I answer him; I am with him in distress; I deliver him and esteem him.”
{91:16} With long life I satisfy him, And show him My deliverance.
{92:1} It is good to give thanks to יהוה, And to sing praises to Your Name, O Most High;
{92:2} To declare Your loving-commitment in the morning, And Your trustworthiness each night,
{92:3} On ten strings, and on the harp, To the sounding chords of the lyre.
{92:4} For You have made me rejoice with Your work, O יהוה, I shout for joy at the works of Your hands.
{92:5} O יהוה, how great are Your works! Your thoughts are very deep!
{92:6} A senseless man does not know, And a fool does not understand this.
{92:7} When the wrong spring up like grass, And all the workers of wickedness blossom, It is for them to be destroyed forever.
{92:8} But You, יהוה, are on high forever.
{92:9} For look, Your enemies, O יהוה, For look, Your enemies do perish; All the workers of wickedness are scattered.
{92:10} But You lift up my horn like a wild ox; I have been anointed with fresh oil.
{92:11} And my eye looks upon my enemies; My ears hear the evil-doers Who rise up against me.
{92:12} The righteous one flourishes like a palm tree, He grows like a cedar in Leḇanon.
{92:13} Those who are planted in the House of יהוה Flourish in the courts of our Elohim.
{92:14} They still bear fruit in old age; They are fresh and green,
{92:15} To declare that יהוה is straight, My rock, and in Him is no unrighteousness.
{93:1} יהוה shall reign, He shall put on excellency; יהוה shall put on strength; He shall gird Himself. Indeed, the world is established, immovable.
{93:2} Your throne is established from of old; You are from everlasting.
{93:3} Rivers shall lift up, O יהוה, Rivers shall lift up their voice; Rivers lift up their breakers.
{93:4} יהוה on high is mightier Than the noise of many waters, The mighty breakers of the sea.
{93:5} Your witnesses have been very trustworthy. Set-apartness befits Your house, O יהוה, forever.
{94:1} O יהוה, Ěl of vengeance; O Ěl of vengeance, shine forth!
{94:2} Raise Yourself up, O Judge of the earth; Render punishment to the proud.
{94:3} יהוה, how long are the wrong, How long are the wrong going to exult?
{94:4} They pour forth words, They speak arrogantly; All the workers of wickedness boast in themselves.
{94:5} They crush Your people, O יהוה, And they afflict Your inheritance.
{94:6} They kill the widow and the stranger, And murder the fatherless.
{94:7} Yet they say, “Yah does not see, And the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ pays no heed.”
{94:8} Take heed, you senseless among the people; And you fools, when would you become wise?
{94:9} He who planted the ear, does He not hear? He who formed the eye, does He not see?
{94:10} He who disciplines the nations, Does He not reprove – The One teaching man knowledge?
{94:11} יהוה knows the thoughts of man, That they are but a breath.
{94:12} Blessed is the man You discipline, O Yah, And instruct out of Your Torah,
{94:13} To give him rest from the days of evil, Until the pit is dug for the wrong.
{94:14} For יהוה does not leave His people, Nor does He forsake His inheritance.
{94:15} For right-ruling returns man to righteousness, And all the upright in heart follow it.
{94:16} Who would rise up for me against evil-doers? Who would stand up for me against workers of wickedness?
{94:17} If יהוה had not been my help, My being would soon have settled in silence.
{94:18} When I said, “My foot has slipped,” Your loving-commitment, O יהוה, supported me.
{94:19} When anxiety was great within me, Your comforts delighted my being.
{94:20} Would a throne of destruction, Which devises trouble by law, Be joined with You?
{94:21} They band together against the life of the righteous, And declare innocent blood wrong.
{94:22} But יהוה is my defence, And my Elohim the rock of my refuge,
{94:23} And brings back on them their own wickedness, And cuts them off in their own wrongdoing; יהוה our Elohim does cut them off.
{95:1} Come, let us sing to יהוה! Let us raise a shout to the Rock of our deliverance.
{95:2} Let us come before His face with thanksgiving; Let us raise a shout to Him in song.
{95:3} For יהוה is a great Ěl, And a great Sovereign above all mighty ones.
{95:4} In whose hand are the depths of the earth; The mountain peaks are His also.
{95:5} His is the sea, for He made it; And His hands formed the dry land.
{95:6} Come, let us bow down and bend low, Let us kneel before יהוה our Maker.
{95:7} For He is our Elohim, And we are the people of His pasture, And the sheep of His hand. Today, if you would hear His voice:
{95:8} “Do not harden your hearts as in Meriḇah, And as in the day of Massah in the wilderness,
{95:9} When your fathers tried Me, Have proved Me, though they saw My work.”
{95:10} For forty years I was grieved with that generation, And said, ‘They are a people who go astray in their hearts, And they do not know My ways.’
{95:11} As I swore in My wrath, ‘If they enter into My rest...’
{96:1} Sing to יהוה a new song, Sing to יהוה, all the earth!
{96:2} Sing to יהוה, bless His Name, Proclaim His deliverance from day to day.
{96:3} Declare His esteem among the nations, His wonders among all peoples.
{96:4} For great is יהוה and greatly to be praised, He is to be feared above all mighty ones.
{96:5} For all the mighty ones of the peoples are matters of naught, But יהוה made the heavens.
{96:6} Excellency and splendour are before Him, Strength and comeliness are in His set-apart place.
{96:7} Ascribe to יהוה, O clans of the peoples, Ascribe to יהוה esteem and strength.
{96:8} Ascribe to יהוה the esteem of His Name; Bring an offering, and come into His courts.
{96:9} Bow yourselves to יהוה, In the splendour of set-apartness! Tremble before Him, all the earth.
{96:10} Say among nations, “יהוה shall reign. The world also is established, immovable. He judges the peoples in straightness.”
{96:11} Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; Let the sea roar, and all that fills it;
{96:12} Let the field exult, and all that is in it. Let all the trees of the forest then shout for joy,
{96:13} At the presence of יהוה. For He shall come, For He shall come to judge the earth. He judges the world in righteousness, And the peoples with His truth.
{97:1} יהוה shall reign. The earth rejoices. Many isles are glad!
{97:2} Clouds and darkness all around Him, Righteousness and right-ruling are the foundation of His throne.
{97:3} Fire goes before Him, And burns up His adversaries round about.
{97:4} His lightnings shall light the world, The earth shall see and tremble.
{97:5} The mountains shall melt like wax before the face of יהוה, Before the face of the Master of all the earth.
{97:6} The heavens shall declare His righteousness, And all the peoples shall see His esteem.
{97:7} All are put to shame who serve carved images, Those boasting of matters of naught. Bow yourselves to Him, all you mighty ones.
{97:8} Tsiyon shall hear and be glad, And the daughters of Yehuḏah rejoice Because of Your right-rulings, O יהוה.
{97:9} For You, יהוה, are the Most High over all the earth, You shall be greatly exalted, over all mighty ones.
{97:10} You who love יהוה, hate evil! He guards the lives of His lovingly-committed ones, He delivers them out of the hand of the wrong.
{97:11} Light is sown for the righteous, And gladness for the upright in heart.
{97:12} Rejoice in יהוה, you righteous, And give thanks at the remembrance of His Set-apartness.
{98:1} Sing to יהוה a new song! For He has done wonders; His right hand and His set-apart arm Have brought Him deliverance.
{98:2} יהוה has made known His deliverance; His righteousness He has openly shown Before the eyes of the nations.
{98:3} He has remembered His loving-commitment And His trustworthiness to the house of Yisra’ĕl; All the ends of the earth have seen The deliverance of our Elohim.
{98:4} Raise a shout to יהוה, all the earth; Break forth in song, rejoice, and sing praises.
{98:5} Sing to יהוה with the lyre, With the lyre and the voice of a song,
{98:6} With trumpets and a voice of a shophar; Raise a shout before יהוה, the Sovereign.
{98:7} Let the sea roar, and all that fills it, The world and those who dwell in it.
{98:8} Let the rivers clap their hands, Let the mountains sing together for joy before יהוה,
{98:9} For He shall come to judge the earth. He judges the world in righteousness, And the people in straightness.
{99:1} יהוה shall reign; Peoples tremble! He is enthroned on the keruḇim; The earth shakes!
{99:2} יהוה is great in Tsiyon, And He is high above all the peoples.
{99:3} They praise Your Name, great and awesome, It is set-apart.
{99:4} And the strength of the Sovereign Shall love right-ruling; You Yourself shall establish straightness; You shall execute right-ruling And righteousness in Ya‛aqoḇ.
{99:5} Exalt יהוה our Elohim, And bow yourselves at His footstool, He is set-apart.
{99:6} Mosheh and Aharon were among His priests, And Shemu’ĕl was among those calling upon His Name. They called upon יהוה, and He answered them.
{99:7} He spoke to them in the column of cloud; They guarded His witnesses And the law He gave them.
{99:8} You answered them, O יהוה our Elohim. You were a forgiving Ěl to them, Though You took vengeance on their deeds.
{99:9} Exalt יהוה our Elohim, And bow down towards His set-apart mountain; For יהוה our Elohim is set-apart.
{100:1} Raise a shout for יהוה, All the earth!
{100:2} Serve יהוה with gladness; Come before His presence with singing.
{100:3} Know that יהוה, He is Elohim; He has made us, and we are His – His people and the sheep of His pasture.
{100:4} Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, And into His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him; bless His Name.
{100:5} For יהוה is good; His loving-commitment is everlasting, And His truth, to all generations.
{101:1} I sing of loving-commitment and right-ruling; To You, O יהוה, I sing praises.
{101:2} I act wisely in a perfect way. When do You come to me? I walk in the midst of my house with a perfect heart.
{101:3} I set no matter of Beliya‛al before my eyes; I hate the work of those who fall away; It does not cleave to me.
{101:4} A perverse heart turns away from me; I do not know evil.
{101:5} Him who secretly slanders his neighbour I cut off; I do not tolerate one Who has a haughty look and a proud heart.
{101:6} My eyes are on the trustworthy of the land, To dwell with me; He who walks in a perfect way, He serves me.
{101:7} He who practises deceit Does not dwell in my house; He who speaks lies Does not stand in my presence.
{101:8} Each morning I uproot all the wrong of the land, To cut off all the workers of wickedness From the city of יהוה.
{102:1} O יהוה, hear my prayer, And let my cry come to You.
{102:2} Do not hide Your face from me In the day of my distress; Incline Your ear to me; In the day I call, answer me speedily.
{102:3} For my days are consumed like smoke, And my bones are burned like a hearth.
{102:4} My heart is stricken and withered like grass, For I have forgotten to eat my bread.
{102:5} Because of the sound of my sighing My bones have cleaved to my flesh.
{102:6} I have been like a pelican of the wilderness, I have been like an owl of the desert.
{102:7} I have watched, and I am As a bird alone on the house-top.
{102:8} My enemies reproached me all day long, Those who rave against me have sworn against me.
{102:9} For I have eaten ashes like bread, And mixed my drink with tears,
{102:10} Because of Your displeasure and Your wrath; For You have lifted me up And thrown me down.
{102:11} My days are like a shadow that lengthens, And I wither away like grass.
{102:12} But You, O יהוה, shall be enthroned forever, And the remembrance of You be to all generations.
{102:13} You Yourself shall arise And have compassion on Tsiyon, For the time to favour her, The appointed time, has come.
{102:14} For Your servants have been pleased with her stones, And they favour her dust.
{102:15} And the nations shall fear the Name of יהוה, And all the sovereigns of the earth Your esteem,
{102:16} For יהוה shall build up Tsiyon, He shall appear in His esteem.
{102:17} He shall turn unto the prayer of the destitute, And He shall not despise their prayer.
{102:18} This is written for a generation to come, So that a people to be created praise Yah.
{102:19} For He looked down From the height of His set-apart place; From heaven יהוה viewed the earth,
{102:20} To hear the groaning of the prisoner, To release those appointed to death,
{102:21} To declare the Name of יהוה in Tsiyon, And His praise in Yerushalayim,
{102:22} When peoples gather together, And reigns, to serve יהוה.
{102:23} He has humbled my strength in the way; He has shortened my days.
{102:24} I said, “O my Ěl, Do not take me away in the midst of my days; Your years are throughout all generations.
{102:25} “You did found the earth of old, And the heavens are the work of Your hands.
{102:26} They shall perish, but You remain; And all of them grow old like a garment; You change them like a coat, And they are changed.”
{102:27} “But You are the same, And Your years have no end.
{102:28} “The sons of Your servants continue, And their seed is established before You.”
{103:1} Bless יהוה, O my being, And all that is within me, Bless His set-apart Name!
{103:2} Bless יהוה, O my being, And do not forget all His dealings,
{103:3} Who forgives all your crookednesses, Who heals all your diseases,
{103:4} Who redeems your life from destruction, Who crowns you with loving-commitment and compassion,
{103:5} Who satisfies your desire with the good, Your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
{103:6} יהוה is doing righteousness And right-ruling for all the oppressed.
{103:7} He made known His ways to Mosheh, His acts to the children of Yisra’ĕl.
{103:8} יהוה is compassionate and showing favour, Patient, and great in loving-commitment.
{103:9} He does not always strive, nor maintain it forever.
{103:10} He has not done to us according to our sins, Nor rewarded us according to our crookednesses.
{103:11} For as the heavens are high above the earth, So great is His loving-commitment toward those who fear Him;
{103:12} As far as east is from west, So far has He removed our transgressions from us.
{103:13} As a father has compassion for his children, So יהוה has compassion for those who fear Him.
{103:14} For He knows how we are made; He remembers that we are dust.
{103:15} A man’s days are like grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.
{103:16} For the wind blows over it, and it is no more, And its place no longer remembers it.
{103:17} But the loving-commitment of יהוה Is from everlasting to everlasting Upon those who fear Him, And His righteousness to children’s children,
{103:18} To those who guard His covenant, And to those who remember His orders to do them.
{103:19} יהוה has established His throne in the heavens, And His reign shall rule over all.
{103:20} Bless יהוה, you His messengers, Mighty in power, who do His Word, Listening to the voice of His Word.
{103:21} Bless יהוה, all you His hosts, You His servants, who do His pleasure.
{103:22} Bless יהוה, all His works, In all places of His rule. Bless יהוה, O my being!
{104:1} Bless יהוה, O my being! O יהוה my Elohim, You have been very great: You have put on excellency and splendour,
{104:2} Covering Yourself with light as with a garment, Stretching out the heavens like a curtain,
{104:3} Who is laying the beams of His upper rooms in the waters, Who is making thick clouds His chariot, Who is walking on the wings of the wind,
{104:4} Making His messengers the winds, His servants a flame of fire.
{104:5} He established the earth on its foundations, So that it would not totter forever,
{104:6} You covered it with the deep as with a garment; The waters stood above the mountains.
{104:7} At Your rebuke they flee; At the voice of Your thunder they hurry away.
{104:8} They go up the mountains; They go down the valleys, To the place which You founded for them.
{104:9} You did set a boundary, they do not pass over, They do not return to cover the earth.
{104:10} Who is sending the springs into the valleys, They flow among the hills.
{104:11} They give drink to every beast of the field; Wild donkeys break their thirst.
{104:12} The birds of the heavens dwell beside them; They sing from between the branches.
{104:13} Watering the hills from His upper rooms; The earth is satisfied with the fruit of Your works.
{104:14} Causing the grass to grow for the cattle, And plants for the service of mankind, To bring forth food from the earth,
{104:15} And wine that makes glad the heart of man, Oil to make the face shine, And bread which sustains man’s heart.
{104:16} The trees of יהוה are satisfied, The cedars of Leḇanon which He planted,
{104:17} Where the birds do make nests; The stork has her home in the fir trees.
{104:18} The high hills are for wild goats; Rocks a refuge for rock badgers.
{104:19} He made the moon for appointed times; The sun knows its going down.
{104:20} You put darkness, and it is night, In it all the beasts of the forest creep.
{104:21} The young lions are roaring for prey, And seeking their food from Ěl.
{104:22} The sun arises – they withdraw And lie down in their dens.
{104:23} Man goes out to his work, And to his labour, till evening.
{104:24} O יהוה, how many have been Your works! You have made all of them in wisdom. The earth is filled with Your possessions.
{104:25} There is the sea, great and wide, In which are innumerable swarms, Living creatures, small with great.
{104:26} There do ships go; That Liwiathan which You made, to play there.
{104:27} All of them wait for You, To give their food in due season.
{104:28} You give to them, they gather in; You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good.
{104:29} You hide Your face, they are alarmed; You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust;
{104:30} You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; And You renew the face of the earth.
{104:31} The esteem of יהוה is forever, יהוה rejoices in His works,
{104:32} Who looks on the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smoke.
{104:33} I sing to יהוה as long as I live, I sing praise to my Elohim while I exist.
{104:34} My meditation on Him is sweet; I rejoice in יהוה.
{104:35} Let sinners be consumed from the earth, And let the wrong be no more. Bless יהוה, O my being! Praise Yah!
{105:1} Give thanks to יהוה! Call upon His Name, Make known His deeds among the peoples.
{105:2} Sing to Him, sing praise to Him; Speak of all His wonders.
{105:3} Make your boast in His set-apart Name; Let the hearts rejoice of those seeking יהוה.
{105:4} Seek יהוה and His strength; Seek His face always.
{105:5} Remember His wonders which He has done, His miracles, and the right-rulings of His mouth,
{105:6} O seed of Aḇraham His servant, Children of Ya‛aqoḇ, His chosen ones!
{105:7} He is יהוה our Elohim; His right-rulings are in all the earth.
{105:8} He has remembered His covenant forever, The Word He commanded, for a thousand generations,
{105:9} The covenant He made with Aḇraham, And His oath to Yitsḥaq,
{105:10} And established it to Ya‛aqoḇ for a law, To Yisra’ĕl – an everlasting covenant,
{105:11} Saying, “To you I give the land of Kena‛an, The portion of your inheritance.”
{105:12} When they were few in number, Few indeed, and sojourners in it,
{105:13} And they went about from one nation to another, From one reign to another people,
{105:14} He allowed no one to oppress them, And He reproved sovereigns for their sakes,
{105:15} Saying, “Do not touch My anointed ones, And do My prophets no evil.”
{105:16} And He called for a scarcity of food in the land; He cut off all the supply of bread.
{105:17} He sent ahead of them a man, Yosĕph, sold as a slave.
{105:18} They afflicted his feet with shackles, His neck was put in irons.
{105:19} Until the time that His Word came, The Word of יהוה tried him.
{105:20} The sovereign sent and released him, The ruler of the people let him loose.
{105:21} He made him master of his house, And ruler over all his possessions,
{105:22} To bind his chiefs at his pleasure, And to teach his elders wisdom.
{105:23} Then Yisra’ĕl came to Mitsrayim, And Ya‛aqoḇ sojourned in the land of Ḥam.
{105:24} And He increased His people greatly, And made them stronger than their enemies.
{105:25} He turned their heart to hate His people, To conspire against His servants.
{105:26} He sent Mosheh His servant, Aharon whom He had chosen.
{105:27} They set among them the matters of His signs, And wonders in the land of Ḥam.
{105:28} He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they did not rebel against His word.
{105:29} He turned their waters into blood, And killed their fish.
{105:30} Their land teemed with frogs, In the rooms of their sovereigns.
{105:31} He spoke, and swarms of flies came, Gnats in all their borders.
{105:32} He gave them hail for rain, A flaming fire in their land.
{105:33} And He struck their vines and their fig trees, And broke the trees of their borders.
{105:34} He spoke, and locusts came, And larvae, innumerable,
{105:35} And they devoured all the plants in their land, And they devoured the fruit of their ground.
{105:36} Then He struck all the first-born in their land, The first-fruit of all their strength,
{105:37} And brought them out with silver and gold, And among His tribes no one faltered.
{105:38} Mitsrayim was glad when they left, For the fear of them had fallen upon them.
{105:39} He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night.
{105:40} They asked, and He brought quail, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
{105:41} He opened the rock, and water gushed out; It ran in the dry places, a river.
{105:42} For He remembered His set-apart word, To Aḇraham His servant.
{105:43} So He brought out His people with joy, His chosen ones with singing.
{105:44} And He gave to them the lands of the nations, And they inherited the labour of peoples,
{105:45} In order that they might guard His laws, And watch over His Torot. Praise Yah!
{106:1} Praise Yah! Oh, give thanks to יהוה, For He is good! For His loving-commitment is everlasting.
{106:2} Who does relate the mighty acts of יהוה? Or declare all His praise?
{106:3} Blessed are those who guard right-ruling, Who do righteousness at all times!
{106:4} Remember me, O יהוה, in the acceptance of Your people; Visit me with Your deliverance,
{106:5} To see the good of Your chosen ones, To rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, To make my boast with Your inheritance.
{106:6} We have sinned with our fathers, We have acted perversely, We have done wrong.
{106:7} Our fathers in Mitsrayim did not understand Your wonders; They did not remember Your many loving-commitments, But rebelled by the sea, the Sea of Reeds.
{106:8} But He saved them for His Name’s sake, To make known His might.
{106:9} And He rebuked the Sea of Reeds, and it dried up; And He led them through the depths, Through a wilderness.
{106:10} And He saved them from the hand of the hater, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
{106:11} And waters covered their adversaries; Not one of them was left.
{106:12} Then they believed His words; They sang His praise.
{106:13} They soon forgot His works; They did not wait for His counsel,
{106:14} But greedily lusted in the wilderness, And tried Ěl in the desert.
{106:15} And He gave them their request, But sent leanness within their being.
{106:16} And they were jealous of Mosheh in the camp, Of Aharon, the set-apart one of יהוה,
{106:17} Then the earth opened up and swallowed Dathan, And covered the company of Aḇiram.
{106:18} And a fire burned in their company; A flame consumed the wrong.
{106:19} They made a calf in Ḥorĕḇ, And bowed down to a moulded image.
{106:20} Thus they changed My esteem Into the form of an ox that eats grass.
{106:21} They forgot Ěl their Saviour, The Doer of great deeds in Mitsrayim,
{106:22} Of wonders in the land of Ḥam, Of awesome deeds by the Sea of Reeds.
{106:23} Then He said that He would destroy them, Had not Mosheh His chosen one stood before Him in the breach, To turn away His wrath from destroying them.
{106:24} They then despised the pleasant land; They did not believe His word,
{106:25} And they grumbled in their tents, They did not listen to the voice of יהוה.
{106:26} So He lifted up His hand in an oath against them, To make them fall in the wilderness,
{106:27} And to make their seed fall among the nations, And to scatter them in the lands.
{106:28} And they joined themselves to Ba‛al Pe‛or, And ate slaughterings made to the dead.
{106:29} Thus they provoked Him with their deeds, And the plague broke out among them.
{106:30} Then Pineḥas stood up and intervened, And the plague was stopped.
{106:31} And that was reckoned to him for righteousness To all generations forever.
{106:32} And they provoked wrath at the waters of Meriḇah, And Mosheh suffered on account of them;
{106:33} Because they embittered his spirit, And he spoke rashly with his lips.
{106:34} They did not destroy the peoples, As יהוה had commanded them,
{106:35} But mixed with the nations And learned their works,
{106:36} And served their idols, And they became a snare to them.
{106:37} And they slaughtered their sons And their daughters to demons,
{106:38} And they shed innocent blood, The blood of their sons and daughters, Whom they slaughtered to the idols of Kena‛an; And the land was defiled with blood.
{106:39} So they became unclean by their own works, And went whoring by their own deeds.
{106:40} And the wrath of יהוה burned against His people, And He loathed His own inheritance.
{106:41} Then He gave them into the hand of the nations, And those who hated them ruled over them.
{106:42} And their enemies oppressed them, And they were humbled under their hand.
{106:43} Many times He delivered them; But they rebelled in their plans, So they were brought low for their crookedness.
{106:44} But He would look on their distress, When He heard their cry,
{106:45} And remember His covenant for their sake, And relent according to the greatness of His loving-commitment.
{106:46} And He would let them find compassion, Before all those holding them captive.
{106:47} Save us, O יהוה our Elohim, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks to Your set-apart Name, To exult in Your praise.
{106:48} Blessed be יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl From everlasting to everlasting! And all the people shall say, “Amĕn!” Praise Yah!
{107:1} Give thanks to יהוה! For He is good, For His loving-commitment is everlasting.
{107:2} Let the redeemed of יהוה say so, Whom He has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
{107:3} And gathered out of the lands, From east and from west, From north and from south.
{107:4} They wandered in a wilderness, in a desert way; They found no city to dwell in.
{107:5} Hungry and thirsty, Their being in them grew faint.
{107:6} Then they cried out to יהוה in their distress, He delivered them out of their troubles.
{107:7} And He guided them by the right way, To go to a city to settle.
{107:8} Let them give thanks to יהוה for His loving-commitment, And His wonders to the children of men!
{107:9} For He has satisfied a longing being, And has filled the hungry being with goodness.
{107:10} Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Bound in affliction and irons,
{107:11} Because they rebelled against the words of Ěl, And despised the counsel of the Most High.
{107:12} And He humbled their heart by toil; They stumbled, and there was no one to help.
{107:13} And they cried out to יהוה in their distress, And He saved them out of their troubles.
{107:14} He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And He broke their chains in pieces.
{107:15} Let them give thanks to יהוה for His loving-commitment, And His wonders to the children of men!
{107:16} For He has broken the gates of bronze, And He cut the bars of iron in two.
{107:17} Fools, because of their transgression, And because of their crookednesses, were afflicted.
{107:18} Their being loathed all food, And they drew near to the gates of death,
{107:19} And cried out to יהוה in their distress, He saved them out of their troubles.
{107:20} He sent His word and healed them, And delivered them from their destructions.
{107:21} Let them give thanks to יהוה for His loving-commitment, And His wonders to the children of men!
{107:22} And let them slaughter slaughterings of thanksgiving, And relate His works with rejoicing.
{107:23} Those who go down to the sea in ships, Doing work in many waters,
{107:24} They see the works of יהוה, And His wonders in the deep.
{107:25} For He commands and raises the stormy wind, Which lifts up the waves of the sea.
{107:26} They go up to the heavens, They go down to the depths; Their being is melted because of evil.
{107:27} They celebrate and stagger like a drunkard, And all their wisdom is swallowed up.
{107:28} Then they cry out to יהוה in their distress, And He brings them out of their troubles.
{107:29} He caused the storm to be still, So that its waves were silent.
{107:30} And they rejoice because they are hushed; And He leads them to the haven of their delight.
{107:31} Let them give thanks to יהוה for His loving-commitment, And His wonders to the children of men!
{107:32} And let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people, And praise Him in the seat of the elders.
{107:33} He makes rivers become a wilderness, And the fountains of water become a dry ground;
{107:34} A land of fruit becomes a salty desert, For the evil of those who dwell in it.
{107:35} He makes a wilderness become a pool of water, And dry land become fountains of waters.
{107:36} And He causes the hungry to dwell there, And they build a city to settle in,
{107:37} And they sow fields and plant vineyards, And they make fruits of increase.
{107:38} And He blesses them, And they increase greatly; And He lets not their cattle diminish.
{107:39} But when they are diminished and brought low Through oppression, evil and sorrow,
{107:40} He pours scorn on nobles, And causes them to wander in a pathless waste;
{107:41} But He raises the poor up from affliction, And makes their clans like a flock.
{107:42} The straight ones see, and rejoice, And all unrighteousness shuts its mouth.
{107:43} Who is wise? Then let him observe these matters! Let them understand the loving-commitments of יהוה.
{108:1} O Elohim, my heart is steadfast; I sing and give praise – even my esteem.
{108:2} Awake, harp and lyre! I awake the dawn.
{108:3} I praise You, O יהוה, among peoples, And I sing praises to You among the nations.
{108:4} For Your loving-commitment is great above the heavens, And Your truth reaches to the clouds.
{108:5} Exalt Yourself above the heavens, O Elohim, And Your esteem above all the earth;
{108:6} In order that those You love Might be delivered. Save with Your right hand, And answer me.
{108:7} Elohim has spoken in His set-apartness, “I exult, I portion out Sheḵem, And I measure out the Valley of Sukkoth.
{108:8} Gil‛aḏ is Mine, Menashsheh is Mine, And Ephrayim is My chief defence, Yehuḏah is My inscriber.
{108:9} Mo’aḇ is My wash-pot, Over Eḏom I cast My shoe, Over Philistia I raise a shout.
{108:10} Who would bring me into the strong city? Who shall lead me to Eḏom?
{108:11} Have You not rejected us, O Elohim? And You do not go out with our armies, O Elohim!
{108:12} Give us help from distress, For the help of man is naught.
{108:13} In Elohim we do mightily, For it is He who treads down our adversaries.
{109:1} Do not be silent, O Elohim of my praise!
{109:2} For the mouth of the wrong And the mouth of the deceiver Have opened against me; They have spoken against me with a false tongue.
{109:3} They have surrounded me with words of hatred, And they attack me without a cause.
{109:4} In return for my love they accuse me, While I am in prayer.
{109:5} And they repay me evil for good, And hatred for my love.
{109:6} Appoint over him one who is wrong, And let an accuser stand at his right hand.
{109:7} When he is judged, let him be found wrong, And let his prayer become sin.
{109:8} Let his days be few, Let another take his office.
{109:9} Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow.
{109:10} And let his children always wander and beg, And seek food out of their ruins.
{109:11} Let the creditor lay a snare for all that he has, And let strangers plunder his labour.
{109:12} Let him have no one to extend loving-commitment, Nor any to show favour to his fatherless children.
{109:13} Let his descendants be cut off, Their name be blotted out in the next generation.
{109:14} Let the crookedness of his fathers Be remembered before יהוה, And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
{109:15} Let them always be before יהוה, And let Him cut off their remembrance from the earth;
{109:16} Because he did not remember to show loving-commitment, But persecuted the poor and needy man; And the broken-hearted, to put to death.
{109:17} He also loved cursing, so let it come to him; And he did not delight in blessing, so let it be far from him.
{109:18} And he put cursing on as with his garment, So let it enter his inward parts like water, Into his bones and like oil.
{109:19} Let it be to him like a cloak he wraps around him, And as a girdle that he always girds on.
{109:20} This is the reward of my accusers from יהוה, And to those speaking evil against my being.
{109:21} But You, O יהוה, Master, Deal with me for Your Name’s sake; Because Your loving-commitment is good, deliver me.
{109:22} For I am poor and needy, And my heart is pierced within me.
{109:23} I have gone like a lengthening shadow, I have been driven away like a locust.
{109:24} My knees are weak through fasting, And my flesh grows lean from fatness.
{109:25} And I, I have become a reproach to them; They see me, they shake their heads.
{109:26} Help me, O יהוה my Elohim! Save me according to Your loving-commitment,
{109:27} And let them know that this is Your hand. You, יהוה, You have done it!
{109:28} Let them curse, but You bless. They shall arise, but be ashamed, And let Your servant rejoice.
{109:29} Let my accusers put on shame, And be wrapped in their own confusion as in a cloak.
{109:30} I greatly thank יהוה with my mouth, And I praise Him in the midst of the throng.
{109:31} For He stands at the right hand of the poor, To save from those judging his being.
{110:1} יהוה said to my Master, “Sit at My right hand, Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”
{110:2} יהוה sends Your mighty sceptre out of Tsiyon. Rule in the midst of Your enemies!
{110:3} Your people volunteer in the day of Your might, In the splendours of set-apartness! From the womb, from the morning, You have the dew of Your youth!
{110:4} יהוה has sworn and does not relent, “You are a priest forever According to the order of Malkitseḏeq.”
{110:5} יהוה at Your right hand Shall smite sovereigns in the day of His wrath.
{110:6} He judges among the nations, He shall fill the nations with dead bodies, He shall crush the Head over the mighty earth!
{110:7} He drinks of the stream by the wayside, Therefore He does lift up the head!
{111:1} Aleph Praise Yah! I thank יהוה with all my heart, Bĕt In the company of the straight, and of the congregation.
{111:2} Gimel Great are the works of יהוה, Dalet Searched for by all who delight in them.
{111:3} Hĕ Splendour and greatness are His work, Waw And His righteousness stands forever.
{111:4} Zayin He has made His wonders to be remembered; Ḥet יהוה shows favour and is compassionate.
{111:5} Tet He has given food to those who fear Him; Yod He remembers His covenant forever.
{111:6} Kaph He has shown His people the power of His works, Lamed To give to them the inheritance of the nations.
{111:7} Mem The works of His hands are truth and right-ruling, Nun All His orders are trustworthy,
{111:8} Sameḵ They are upheld forever and ever, Ayin Performed in truth and straightness.
{111:9} Pĕ He sent redemption to His people, Tsadi He has commanded His covenant forever. Qoph Set-apart and awesome is His Name.
{111:10} Rĕsh The fear of יהוה is the beginning of wisdom, Shin All those doing them have a good understanding. Taw His praise is standing forever.
{112:1} Aleph Praise Yah! Blessed is the man, Who fears יהוה, Bĕt Who has greatly delighted in His commands.
{112:2} Gimel Mighty in the earth shall be his seed, Dalet The generation of the straight ones shall be blessed.
{112:3} Hĕ Wealth and riches are in his house, Waw And his righteousness is standing forever.
{112:4} Zayin Light has risen in the darkness to the straight ones, Those showing favour, Ḥet The compassionate, And the righteous.
{112:5} Tet Good is a man showing favour and lending, Yod He sustains his matters in right-ruling.
{112:6} Kaph For he is never shaken; Lamed The righteous is remembered forever.
{112:7} Mem He is not afraid of an evil report. Nun His heart is steadfast, trusting in יהוה.
{112:8} Sameḵ His heart is upheld, he is not afraid, Ayin While he looks on his adversaries.
{112:9} Pĕ He scattered abroad, He gave to the poor, Tsadi His righteousness is standing forever. Qoph His horn is exalted with esteem.
{112:10} Rĕsh The wrong one sees it and shall be vexed; Shin He gnashes his teeth and shall melt. Taw The desire of the wrong ones does perish.
{113:1} Praise Yah! Praise, O servants of יהוה, Praise the Name of יהוה!
{113:2} Blessed be the Name of יהוה, Now and forever!
{113:3} From the rising of the sun to its going down, The Name of יהוה is praised.
{113:4} יהוה is high above all nations, His esteem above the heavens.
{113:5} Who is like יהוה our Elohim, Who is enthroned on high?
{113:6} He looks down on the heavens and in the earth;
{113:7} He raises the poor out of the dust, Lifts the needy from a dunghill,
{113:8} To make him sit with the nobles, With the nobles of His people,
{113:9} Causing the barren woman to dwell in a house, A rejoicing mother of children. Praise Yah!
{114:1} When Yisra’ĕl went out of Mitsrayim, The house of Ya‛aqoḇ from a people of strange language,
{114:2} Yehuḏah became His set-apart place, And Yisra’ĕl His rule.
{114:3} The sea saw it and fled; The Yardĕn turned back.
{114:4} The mountains skipped like rams, The little hills like lambs.
{114:5} Why was it, O sea, that you fled? O Yardĕn, that you turned back?
{114:6} O mountains, that you skipped like rams? O little hills, like lambs?
{114:7} Tremble, O earth, from the face of the Master, From the face of the Eloah of Ya‛aqoḇ,
{114:8} Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of water.
{115:1} Not to us, O יהוה, not to us, But to Your Name give esteem, For Your loving-commitment, For Your truth.
{115:2} Why should the nations say, “Where now is their Elohim?”
{115:3} But our Elohim is in the heavens; Whatever pleased Him, He has done.
{115:4} Their idols are silver and gold, The work of men’s hands.
{115:5} They have mouths, but they do not speak; They have eyes, but they do not see;
{115:6} They have ears, but they do not hear; They have noses, but they do not smell;
{115:7} They have hands, but they do not handle; They have feet, but they do not walk; They make no sound through their throat.
{115:8} The ones who make them, shall become like them – All who trust in them.
{115:9} O Yisra’ĕl, trust in יהוה; He is their help and their shield.
{115:10} O house of Aharon, trust in יהוה; He is their help and their shield.
{115:11} You who fear יהוה, trust in יהוה; He is their help and their shield.
{115:12} יהוה has remembered us; He blesses us; He blesses the house of Yisra’ĕl; He blesses the house of Aharon.
{115:13} He blesses those who fear יהוה, The small and the great.
{115:14} יהוה gives you increase more and more, You and your children.
{115:15} You are blessed by יהוה, Who made the heavens and earth.
{115:16} The heavens are the heavens of יהוה; But He has given the earth to the children of men.
{115:17} The dead do not praise Yah, Nor any going down to silence.
{115:18} But we, we bless Yah Now and forever. Praise Yah!
{116:1} I love יהוה, because He has heard my voice, my pleas.
{116:2} Because He has inclined His ear to me, And I shall call throughout my days.
{116:3} The cords of death were around me, And the pains of She’ol came upon me; I found distress and sorrow.
{116:4} Then I called upon the Name of יהוה, “O יהוה, I pray to You, deliver my being!”
{116:5} יהוה shows favour and is righteous; And our Elohim is compassionate.
{116:6} יהוה guards the simple; I was brought low, but He saved me.
{116:7} Return to your rest, O my being, For יהוה has treated you well.
{116:8} For You have delivered my being from death, My eyes from tears, My feet from falling.
{116:9} I shall walk before יהוה in the land of the living.
{116:10} I have believed, for I speak; I have been greatly afflicted.
{116:11} I said in my haste, “All men are liars.”
{116:12} What shall I return to יהוה? All His bounties are upon me.
{116:13} I lift up the cup of deliverance, And call upon the Name of יהוה.
{116:14} I pay my vows to יהוה Now in the presence of all His people.
{116:15} Precious in the eyes of יהוה Is the death of His lovingly-committed ones.
{116:16} O יהוה, I am truly Your servant, I am Your servant, the son of Your female servant; You have loosed my bonds.
{116:17} I slaughter You a slaughtering of thanksgiving, And call upon the Name of יהוה.
{116:18} I pay my vows to יהוה In the presence of all His people,
{116:19} In the courts of the House of יהוה, In your midst, O Yerushalayim. Praise Yah!
{117:1} Praise יהוה, all you nations! Extol Him, all you peoples!
{117:2} For His loving-commitment is mighty over us, And the truth of יהוה is everlasting. Praise Yah!
{118:1} Oh, give thanks to יהוה, for He is good! Because His loving-commitment is everlasting.
{118:2} Let Yisra’ĕl now say, “His loving-commitment is everlasting.”
{118:3} Let the house of Aharon now say, “His loving-commitment is everlasting.”
{118:4} Let those who fear יהוה now say, “His loving-commitment is everlasting.”
{118:5} I called on Yah in distress; Yah answered me in a broad place.
{118:6} יהוה is on my side; I do not fear what man does to me!
{118:7} יהוה is for me among those helping me; Therefore I look on those hating me.
{118:8} It is better to take refuge in יהוה Than to trust in man.
{118:9} It is better to take refuge in יהוה Than to trust in princes.
{118:10} All the nations surrounded me, In the Name of יהוה I shall cut them off.
{118:11} They surrounded me, Yes, they surrounded me; In the Name of יהוה shall I cut them off.
{118:12} They surrounded me like bees; They were extinguished like burning thorns; In the Name of יהוה I shall cut them off.
{118:13} Pushing, the enemy pushed me to fall, But יהוה helped me.
{118:14} Yah is my strength and song, And He has become my deliverance.
{118:15} The voice of rejoicing and deliverance Is in the tents of the righteous; The right hand of יהוה is doing mightily.
{118:16} The right hand of יהוה is exalted, The right hand of יהוה acts mightily.
{118:17} Let me not die, but live, And declare the works of Yah.
{118:18} Yah has punished me severely, But did not give me over to death.
{118:19} Open to me the gates of righteousness; I enter through them, I thank Yah.
{118:20} This is the gate of יהוה, The righteous enter through it.
{118:21} I thank You, For You have answered me, And have become my deliverance.
{118:22} The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief corner-stone.
{118:23} This was from יהוה, It is marvellous in our eyes.
{118:24} This is the day יהוה has made, Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
{118:25} I pray, O יהוה, please save us now; I pray, O יהוה, please send prosperity.
{118:26} Blessed is He who is coming in the Name of יהוה! We shall bless you from the House of יהוה.
{118:27} יהוה is Ěl, and He gave us light; Bind the festival offering With cords to the horns of the slaughter-place.
{118:28} You are my Ěl, and I praise You; You are my Elohim, I exalt You.
{118:29} Give thanks to יהוה, for He is good! For His loving-commitment is everlasting.
{119:1} Aleph Blessed are the perfect in the way, Who walk in the Torah of יהוה!
{119:2} Blessed are those who observe His witnesses, Who seek Him with all the heart!
{119:3} Yes, they shall do no unrighteousness; They shall walk in His ways.
{119:4} You have commanded us To guard Your orders diligently.
{119:5} Oh, that my ways were established To guard Your laws!
{119:6} Then I would not be ashamed, When I look into all Your commands.
{119:7} I thank You with uprightness of heart, When I learn the right-rulings of Your righteousness.
{119:8} I guard Your laws; Oh, do not leave me entirely!
{119:9} Bĕt How would a young man cleanse his path? To guard it according to Your word.
{119:10} I have sought You with all my heart; Let me not stray from Your commands!
{119:11} I have treasured up Your word in my heart, That I might not sin against You.
{119:12} Blessed are You, O יהוה! Teach me Your laws.
{119:13} With my lips I have recounted All the right-rulings of Your mouth.
{119:14} I have rejoiced in the way of Your witnesses, As over all riches.
{119:15} I meditate on Your orders, And regard Your ways.
{119:16} I delight myself in Your laws; I do not forget Your word.
{119:17} Gimel Do good to Your servant, Let me live and I guard Your word.
{119:18} Open my eyes, that I might see Wonders from Your Torah.
{119:19} I am a sojourner in the earth; Do not hide Your commands from me.
{119:20} My being is crushed with longing For Your right-rulings at all times.
{119:21} You rebuked the proud, cursed ones, Who are straying from Your commands.
{119:22} Remove from me reproach and scorn, For I have observed Your witnesses.
{119:23} Though princes sat, speaking against me, Your servant meditates on Your laws.
{119:24} Your witnesses also are my delight, My counsellors.
{119:25} Dalet My being has been clinging to the dust; Revive me according to Your word.
{119:26} I have recounted my ways and You answered me; Teach me Your laws.
{119:27} Make me understand the way of Your orders; That I might meditate on Your wonders.
{119:28} My being has wept from grief; Strengthen me according to Your word.
{119:29} Remove from me the way of falsehood, And favour me with Your Torah.
{119:30} I have chosen the way of truth; Your right-rulings I have held level.
{119:31} I have clung to Your witnesses; O יהוה, do not put me to shame!
{119:32} I run the way of Your commands, For You enlarge my heart.
{119:33} Hĕ Teach me, O יהוה, the way of Your laws, And I observe it to the end.
{119:34} Make me understand, that I might observe Your Torah, And guard it with all my heart.
{119:35} Make me walk in the path of Your commands, For I have delighted in it.
{119:36} Incline my heart to Your witnesses, And not to own gain.
{119:37} Turn away my eyes from looking at falsehood, And revive me in Your way.
{119:38} Establish Your word to Your servant, Which leads to the fear of You.
{119:39} Turn away my reproach which I dread, For Your right-rulings are good.
{119:40} See, I have longed for Your orders; Revive me in Your righteousness.
{119:41} Waw And let Your loving-commitments come to me, O יהוה; Your deliverance, according to Your word,
{119:42} So that I answer my reprover, For I have trusted in Your word.
{119:43} And do not take away from my mouth The word of truth entirely, For I have waited for Your right-rulings;
{119:44} That I might guard Your Torah continually, Forever and ever;
{119:45} That I might walk in a broad place, For I have sought Your orders;
{119:46} That I might speak of Your witnesses before sovereigns, And not be ashamed;
{119:47} That I might delight myself in Your commands, Which I have loved;
{119:48} That I might lift up my hands to Your commands, Which I have loved; While I meditate on Your laws.
{119:49} Zayin Remember the word to Your servant, On which You have caused me to wait.
{119:50} This is my comfort in my affliction, For Your word has given me life.
{119:51} The proud have utterly scorned me, I did not turn aside from Your Torah.
{119:52} I remembered Your right-rulings of old, O יהוה, And I comfort myself.
{119:53} Rage has seized me because of the wrong Who forsake Your Torah.
{119:54} Your laws have been my songs In the place of my sojournings.
{119:55} I have remembered Your Name in the night, O יהוה, And I guard Your Torah.
{119:56} This has become mine, Because I have observed Your orders.
{119:57} Ḥet You are my portion, O יהוה; I have promised to guard Your words.
{119:58} I have sought Your face with all my heart; Show me favour according to Your word.
{119:59} I have thought upon my ways, And turned my feet to Your witnesses.
{119:60} I have hurried, and did not delay To guard Your commands.
{119:61} The cords of the wrong have surrounded me, Your Torah I have not forgotten.
{119:62} At midnight I rise to give thanks to You, For Your righteous right-rulings.
{119:63} I am a companion of all who fear You, And of those guarding Your orders.
{119:64} O יהוה, Your loving-commitment has filled the earth; Teach me Your laws.
{119:65} Tet You have done good to Your servant, O יהוה, According to Your word.
{119:66} Teach me good sense and knowledge, For I have trusted in Your commands.
{119:67} Before I was afflicted I myself was going astray, But now I have guarded Your word.
{119:68} You are good, and do good; Teach me Your laws.
{119:69} The proud have forged a lie against me, With all my heart I observe Your orders.
{119:70} Their heart has become like fat, Without feeling; I have delighted in Your Torah.
{119:71} It was good for me that I was afflicted, That I might learn Your laws.
{119:72} The Torah of Your mouth is better to me Than thousands of gold and silver pieces.

{119:81} Kaph For Your deliverance my being has pined away, For I have waited for Your word.
{119:82} My eyes have pined away for Your word, Saying, “When would it comfort me?”
{119:83} For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, Your laws I have not forgotten.
{119:84} How many are the days of Your servant? When do You execute right-ruling On those who persecute me?
{119:85} The proud have dug pits for me, Which is not according to Your Torah.
{119:86} All Your commands are trustworthy; They have persecuted me with lies; Help me!
{119:87} They almost made an end of me on earth, But I, I did not forsake Your orders.

{119:89} Lamed Forever, O יהוה, Your word stands firm in the heavens.
{119:90} Your trustworthiness is to all generations; You established the earth, and it stands.
{119:91} According to Your right-rulings They have stood to this day, For all are Your servants.
{119:92} If Your Torah had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction.
{119:93} Let me never forget Your orders, For by them You have given me life.
{119:94} I am Yours, save me; For I have sought Your orders.
{119:95} The wrong have waited for me to destroy me; I understand Your witnesses.
{119:96} I have seen an end of all perfection; Your command is exceedingly broad.
{119:97} Mem O how I love Your Torah! It is my study all day long.
{119:98} Your commands make me wiser than my enemies; For it is ever before me.
{119:99} I have more understanding than all my teachers, For Your witnesses are my study.
{119:100} I understand more than the aged, For I have observed Your orders.

{119:129} Pĕ Your witnesses are wonders; So my being observes them.

{119:131} I have opened my mouth and panted, For I have longed for Your commands.
{119:132} Turn to me and show me favour, According to Your right-ruling, toward those who love Your Name.
{119:133} Establish my footsteps by Your word, And let no wickedness have rule over me.
{119:134} Redeem me from the oppression of man, That I might guard Your orders.
{119:135} Make Your face shine upon Your servant, And teach me Your laws.
{119:136} Streams of water have run down from my eyes, Because they did not guard Your Torah.
{119:137} Tsadi Righteous are You, O יהוה, And Your right-rulings are straight.
{119:138} You have commanded Your witnesses In righteousness and truth, exceedingly.
{119:139} My ardour has consumed me, For my adversaries have forgotten Your words.
{119:140} Your word is tried, exceedingly; And Your servant has loved it.
{119:141} I am small and despised; I have not forgotten Your orders.
{119:142} Your righteousness is righteousness forever, And Your Torah is truth.
{119:143} Distress and anguish have found me; Your commands are my delight.
{119:144} The righteousness of Your witnesses is forever; Make me understand, that I might live.
{119:145} Qoph I have called with all my heart; Answer me, O יהוה! I observe Your laws.
{119:146} I have called upon You; Save me, that I might guard Your witnesses.
{119:147} I rise before dawn, and cry for help; I have waited for Your word.
{119:148} My eyes have gone before the night watches, To study Your word.
{119:149} Hear my voice according to Your loving-commitment; O יהוה, revive me according to Your right-ruling.
{119:150} Those who pursue mischief have drawn near; They have been far from Your Torah.
{119:151} You are near, O יהוה, And all Your commands are truth.
{119:152} Of old I have known Your witnesses, That You have founded them forever.
{119:153} Rĕsh See my affliction and deliver me, For I have not forgotten Your Torah.
{119:154} Plead my cause and redeem me; Revive me according to Your word.
{119:155} Deliverance is far from the wrong ones, For they have not sought Your laws.
{119:156} Your compassions are many, O יהוה; Revive me according to Your right-rulings.
{119:157} My persecutors and adversaries are many; I have not turned aside from Your witnesses.
{119:158} I saw traitors and was grieved, Because they did not guard Your word.
{119:159} See how I have loved Your orders, יהוה, revive me according to Your loving-commitment.
{119:160} The sum of Your word is truth, And all Your righteous right-rulings are forever.
{119:161} Shin Rulers have persecuted me without a cause, But at Your word my heart stood in awe.
{119:162} I rejoice at Your word As one who finds great treasure.
{119:163} I have hated falsehood and loathe it, Your Torah I have loved.
{119:164} I have praised You seven times a day, Because of Your righteous right-rulings.
{119:165} Great peace have those loving Your Torah, And for them there is no stumbling-block.
{119:166} יהוה, I have waited for Your deliverance, And I have done Your commands.
{119:167} My being has guarded Your witnesses, And I love them exceedingly.
{119:168} I have guarded Your orders and Your witnesses, For all my ways are before You.
{119:169} Taw My cry comes before You, O יהוה; Make me understand according to Your word.
{119:170} Let my prayer come before You; Deliver me according to Your word.
{119:171} My lips pour forth praise, For You teach me Your laws.
{119:172} My tongue sings of Your word, For all Your commands are righteousness.
{119:173} Your hand is a help to me, For I have chosen Your orders.
{119:174} I have longed for Your deliverance, O יהוה, And Your Torah is my delight.
{119:175} My being lives, and it praises You; And Your right-rulings help me.
{119:176} I have strayed like a lost sheep; Seek Your servant, For I have not forgotten Your commands.
{120:1} In my distress I cried to יהוה, And He answered me.
{120:2} יהוה, deliver my being from false lips, From a treacherous tongue.
{120:3} What would one give to you, Or what would one do to you, O treacherous tongue?
{120:4} Sharp arrows of a mighty man, With coals of the broom-wood!
{120:5} Woe to me for I have sojourned in Mesheḵ, I have dwelt among the tents of Qĕḏar!
{120:6} My being has dwelt too long With him who hates peace.
{120:7} I am for peace; But when I speak, they are for fighting.
{121:1} I lift up my eyes to the hills; Where does my help come from?
{121:2} My help comes from יהוה, Maker of the heavens and earth.
{121:3} He does not allow your foot to be moved; He who watches over you does not slumber.
{121:4} See, He who is guarding Yisra’ĕl Neither slumbers nor sleeps.
{121:5} יהוה is your guard; יהוה is your shade at your right hand.
{121:6} The sun does not strike you by day, Nor the moon by night.
{121:7} יהוה guards you from all evil; He guards your being.
{121:8} יהוה guards your going out and your coming in Now and forever.
{122:1} I was glad when they said to me, “Let us go into the House of יהוה.”
{122:2} Our feet have been standing Within your gates, O Yerushalayim!
{122:3} Yerushalayim is built As a city that is bound together,
{122:4} Where the tribes have come up, The tribes of Yah, A witness to Yisra’ĕl, To give thanks to the Name of יהוה.
{122:5} For there the thrones of right-ruling were set, The thrones of the house of Dawiḏ.
{122:6} Pray for the peace of Yerushalayim, Let those who love You be at rest.
{122:7} Peace be within your walls, Rest in your citadels.
{122:8} For the sake of my brothers and companions, I say, “Peace be within you.”
{122:9} For the sake of the House of יהוה our Elohim I seek your good.
{123:1} I shall lift up my eyes Unto You who dwell in the heavens.
{123:2} See, as the eyes of servants Are toward the hand of their masters, As the eyes of a female servant Are toward the hand of her mistress, So are our eyes toward יהוה our Elohim, Until He shows favour to us.
{123:3} Show favour to us, O יהוה, show favour to us! For we are exceedingly filled with mockery.
{123:4} Our being is exceedingly filled With the scoffing of those who are at ease, With the mockery of the proud.
{124:1} If it had not been יהוה who was on our side, Let Yisra’ĕl now say;
{124:2} “If it had not been יהוה who was on our side, When men rose up against us,
{124:3} Then they would have swallowed us alive, In their burning rage against us;"
{124:4} “Then the waters would have overwhelmed us, The stream would have gone over our being;
{124:5} “Then the proud waters Would have gone over our being.”
{124:6} Blessed be יהוה, Who did not give us as prey to their teeth.
{124:7} Our being has escaped like a bird From the snare of the trappers; The snare was broken, and we have escaped.
{124:8} Our help is in the Name of יהוה, Maker of the heavens and earth.
{125:1} Those who trust in יהוה Are like Mount Tsiyon – It is not shaken, it remains forever.
{125:2} As the mountains surround Yerushalayim, So יהוה surrounds His people, Now and forever.
{125:3} For the sceptre of wrongness shall not rest On the land allotted to the righteous, Lest the righteous stretch forth their hands to unrighteousness.
{125:4} Do good, O יהוה, to those who are good, And to those who are upright in their hearts.
{125:5} But those who turn aside to their crooked ways, יהוה shall lead them away With the workers of wickedness. Peace be upon Yisra’ĕl!
{126:1} When יהוה turns back the captivity of Tsiyon, We shall be like dreamers.
{126:2} Then our mouth shall be filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing, Then shall they say among the nations, “יהוה has done great deeds for them.”
{126:3} יהוה shall do great deeds for us, We shall be glad.
{126:4} Turn back our captivity, O יהוה, Like the streams in the South.
{126:5} Those sowing in tears, shall reap with songs of joy.
{126:6} He who goes on and weeps, Bearing seed for sowing, Shall indeed come in with rejoicing, Bearing his sheaves.
{127:1} If יהוה does not build the house, Its builders have laboured in vain. If יהוה does not guard the city, The watchman has stayed awake in vain.
{127:2} In vain do you rise up early, To sit up late, to eat the bread of toil; So He gives His beloved sleep.
{127:3} Look, children are an inheritance from יהוה, The fruit of the womb is the reward.
{127:4} As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of one’s youth.
{127:5} Blessed is the man Who has filled his quiver with them. They are not ashamed, When they speak with their enemies in the gate.
{128:1} Blessed are all who fear יהוה, Who walk in His ways.
{128:2} You shall eat the labour of your hands. Be blessed, and let it be well with you.
{128:3} Let your wife be As a fruit-bearing vine within your house, Your sons like olive plants all around your table.
{128:4} Look, so shall the man be blessed Who fears יהוה.
{128:5} יהוה shall bless you out of Tsiyon, And let you see the good of Yerushalayim All the days of your life,
{128:6} And let you see your children’s children! Peace be upon Yisra’ĕl!
{129:1} Often they have distressed me from my youth. Let Yisra’ĕl now say,
{129:2} “Often they have distressed me from my youth, But they have not overcome me.
{129:3} “The ploughers ploughed on my back, They made their furrows long.”
{129:4} יהוה is righteous, He has cut the cords of the wrong in two.
{129:5} Let all those who hate Tsiyon Be put to shame and turned back.
{129:6} Let them be as the grass on the house-tops, Which withers before it grows up,
{129:7} That shall not fill the reaper’s hand, Nor the sheaves fill the binder’s bosom.
{129:8} And those who pass by shall not say, “The blessing of יהוה be upon you; We have blessed you in the Name of יהוה!”
{130:1} Out of the depths I have cried to You, O יהוה.
{130:2} O יהוה, hear my voice! Let Your ears be attentive To the voice of my prayers.
{130:3} O Yah, if You should watch crookednesses, O יהוה, who would stand?
{130:4} But with You there is forgiveness, That You might be feared.
{130:5} I looked to יהוה, My being has looked, And for His word I have waited.
{130:6} My being looks to יהוה More than those watching for morning, watching for morning.
{130:7} O Yisra’ĕl, wait for יהוה; For with יהוה there is loving-commitment. And with Him is much redemption,
{130:8} For He shall redeem Yisra’ĕl From all his crookednesses.
{131:1} O יהוה, my heart has not been proud, Nor have my eyes been haughty. Neither have I concerned myself with great matters, Nor with those too wondrous for me.
{131:2} Have I not calmed, and kept my being silent, Like one weaned by its mother? My being is like one weaned.
{131:3} O Yisra’ĕl, wait for יהוה, Now and forever.
{132:1} O יהוה, remember Dawiḏ, All his afflictions;
{132:2} How he swore to יהוה, Vowed to the Mighty One of Ya‛aqoḇ:
{132:3} “Not to enter into my dwelling-house, Not to get into my bed,
{132:4} Not to give sleep to my eyes, Or slumber to my eyelids,”
{132:5} Until I find a place for יהוה, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Ya‛aqoḇ.
{132:6} See, we heard of it in Ephrathah; We found it in the fields of the forest.
{132:7} Let us go into His dwelling places; Let us bow ourselves at His footstool.
{132:8} Arise, O יהוה, to Your place of rest, You and the ark of Your strength.
{132:9} Let Your priests put on righteousness, And Your lovingly-committed ones shout for joy.
{132:10} For the sake of Your servant Dawiḏ, Do not turn away the face of Your Anointed One.
{132:11} יהוה has sworn in truth to Dawiḏ; He does not turn from it, “Of the fruit of your body I set upon your throne.
{132:12} If your sons guard My covenant And My witnesses that I teach them, Their sons shall sit upon your throne forever.
{132:13} For יהוה has chosen Tsiyon, He has desired it for His dwelling:
{132:14} “This is My place of rest forever; Here I dwell, for I have desired it.
{132:15} I greatly bless her provision, I satisfy her poor with bread.”
{132:16} “And I put deliverance on her priests, And her lovingly-committed ones sing for joy.
{132:17} There I make the horn of Dawiḏ grow; I shall set up a lamp for My Anointed One.”
{132:18} I put shame on his enemies, While on Him His diadem shall shine.
{133:1} See how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity –
{133:2} Like the precious oil on the head, Running down on the beard, The beard of Aharon, Running down on the collar of his robes –
{133:3} Like the dew of Ḥermon, That comes down on the mountains of Tsiyon. For there יהוה commanded the blessing, Life forever!
{134:1} Come, bless יהוה, All you servants of יהוה, Who are standing in the House of יהוה by night!
{134:2} Lift up your hands in the set-apart place, And bless יהוה.
{134:3} יהוה, Maker of the heavens and earth, Does bless you from Tsiyon!
{135:1} Praise Yah! Praise the Name of יהוה; Praise, you servants of יהוה,
{135:2} Who are standing in the House of יהוה, In the courts of the House of our Elohim,
{135:3} Praise Yah, for יהוה is good; Sing praises to His Name, for it is pleasant.
{135:4} For Yah has chosen Ya‛aqoḇ for Himself, Yisra’ĕl for His treasured possession.
{135:5} For I know that יהוה is great, And our Master is above all mighty ones.
{135:6} יהוה has done whatever pleased Him, In the heavens and in earth, In the seas and in all the depths,
{135:7} Causing vapours to go up From the ends of the earth; He made lightning for the rain, Bringing forth wind from His treasuries;
{135:8} Who struck the first-born of Mitsrayim, From man to beast.
{135:9} He sent signs and wonders Into your midst, O Mitsrayim, On Pharaoh and on all his servants;
{135:10} Who struck many nations, And killed mighty sovereigns,
{135:11} Even Siḥon sovereign of the Amorites, And Oḡ sovereign of Bashan, And all the reigns of Kena‛an.
{135:12} And He gave their land as an inheritance, An inheritance to Yisra’ĕl His people.
{135:13} O יהוה, Your Name is forever, O יהוה, Your remembrance to all generations,
{135:14} For יהוה rightly rules His people, And has compassion on His servants.
{135:15} The idols of the nations are silver and gold, The work of men’s hands.
{135:16} They have mouths, but they do not speak; They have eyes, but they do not see;
{135:17} They have ears, but they do not hear; Also there is no breath in their mouth.
{135:18} Those making them become like them, Everyone who is trusting in them.
{135:19} Bless יהוה, O house of Yisra’ĕl! Bless יהוה, O house of Aharon!
{135:20} Bless יהוה, O house of Lĕwi! You who fear יהוה, bless יהוה!
{135:21} Blessed from Tsiyon, יהוה be, Who dwells in Yerushalayim! Praise Yah.
{136:1} Give thanks to יהוה, for He is good! For His loving-commitment is everlasting.
{136:2} Give thanks to the Elohim of mighty ones! For His loving-commitment is everlasting.
{136:3} Give thanks to the Master of masters! For His loving-commitment is everlasting:
{136:4} To Him who alone does great wonders, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:5} To Him who by wisdom made the heavens, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:6} To Him who spread the earth on the waters, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:7} To Him who made great lights, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:8} The sun to rule by day, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:9} The moon and stars to rule by night, For His loving-commitment is everlasting.
{136:10} To Him who struck Mitsrayim in their first-born, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:11} And brought out Yisra’ĕl from their midst, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:12} With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:13} To Him who split apart the Sea of Reeds, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:14} And made Yisra’ĕl pass through the midst of it, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:15} But shook off Pharaoh and his army in the Sea of Reeds, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:16} To Him who led His people through the wilderness, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:17} To Him who struck great sovereigns, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:18} And killed mighty sovereigns, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:19} Even Siḥon sovereign of the Amorites, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:20} And Oḡ sovereign of Bashan, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:21} And gave their land as an inheritance, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:22} An inheritance to Yisra’ĕl His servant, For His loving-commitment is everlasting.
{136:23} Who remembered us in our humiliation, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:24} And rescued us from our adversaries, For His loving-commitment is everlasting;
{136:25} Who gives food to all flesh, For His loving-commitment is everlasting.
{136:26} Give thanks to the Ěl of the heavens! For His loving-commitment is everlasting.
{137:1} By the rivers of Baḇel, There we sat down and we wept As we remembered Tsiyon.
{137:2} We hung our lyres Upon the willows in the midst of it.
{137:3} For there our captors Asked us for the words of a song, And our plunderers for rejoicing, saying, “Sing to us a song of Tsiyon!”
{137:4} How could we sing the song of יהוה On foreign soil?
{137:5} If I forget you, O Yerushalayim, Let my right hand forget.
{137:6} Let my tongue cleave to my palate, If I do not remember you, If I do not exalt Yerushalayim Above my chief joy.
{137:7} Remember, O יהוה, against the sons of Eḏom The day of Yerushalayim, Who said, “Lay it bare, lay it bare, To its foundation!”
{137:8} O daughter of Baḇel, who are to be destroyed, Blessed is he who repays you your deed, What you did to us!
{137:9} Blessed is he who shall take And dash your little ones against the rock.
{138:1} I give You thanks with all my heart; Before the mighty ones I sing praises to You.
{138:2} I bow myself toward Your set-apart Hĕḵal, And give thanks to Your Name For Your loving-commitment and for Your truth; For You have made great Your Word, Your Name, above all.
{138:3} On the day I called You did answer me, You made me bold with strength in my being.
{138:4} Let all the sovereigns of the earth Give thanks to You, O יהוה, When they shall hear the words of Your mouth.
{138:5} And let them sing of the ways of יהוה, For great is the esteem of יהוה.
{138:6} Though יהוה is exalted, He looks on the humble; But the proud He perceives from a distance.
{138:7} Though I walk in the midst of distress, You revive me; You stretch out Your hand Against the wrath of my enemies, And Your right hand saves me.
{138:8} יהוה does perfect for me. O יהוה, Your loving-commitment is everlasting. Do not forsake the works of Your hands.
{139:1} O יהוה, You have searched me And know me.
{139:2} You know my sitting down and my rising up; You understand my thought from afar.
{139:3} You sift my path and my lying down, And know well all my ways.
{139:4} For there is not a word on my tongue, But see, O יהוה, You know it all!
{139:5} You have closed me in, behind and before, And laid Your hand upon me –
{139:6} Knowledge too wondrous for me, It is high, I am unable to reach it.
{139:7} Where would I go from Your Spirit? Or where would I flee from Your face?
{139:8} If I go up into the heavens, You are there; If I make my bed in She’ol, see, You are there.
{139:9} I take the wings of the morning, I dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
{139:10} There, too, Your hand would lead me, And Your right hand hold me.
{139:11} If I say, “Darkness shall cover me,” Then night would be light to me;
{139:12} Even darkness is not dark for You, But night shines as the day – As is darkness, so is light.
{139:13} For You, You possessed my kidneys, You have covered me in my mother’s womb.
{139:14} I give thanks to You, For I am awesomely and wondrously made! Wondrous are Your works, And my being knows it well.
{139:15} My bones were not concealed from You, When I was shaped in a hidden place, Knit together in the depths of the earth.
{139:16} Your eyes saw my unformed body. And in Your book all of them were written, The days they were formed, While none was among them.
{139:17} And how precious are Your thoughts to me, O Ěl! How great has been the sum of them!
{139:18} If I should count them, They would be more than the sand; When I wake up, I am still with You.
{139:19} Oh, that You would kill the wrong, O Eloah! Depart from me, therefore, men of bloodshed!
{139:20} They speak against You wickedly. Bring Your enemies to naught!
{139:21} O יהוה, do I not hate them, who hate You? And do I not loathe those who rise up against You?
{139:22} With a complete hatred I hate them; They have become my enemies.
{139:23} Search me, O Ěl, and know my heart; Try me, and know my thoughts;
{139:24} And see if an idolatrous way is in me, And lead me in the way everlasting.
{140:1} Rescue me, O יהוה, from men of evil; Preserve me from men of violence,
{140:2} Who have devised evils in their hearts; They stir up conflicts all day long.
{140:3} They sharpen their tongues like a snake; The poison of cobras is under their lips. Selah.
{140:4} Guard me, O יהוה, from the hands of the wrong; Guard me from a man of violence, Who has schemed to trip up my steps.
{140:5} The proud have hidden a trap for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set snares for me. Selah.
{140:6} I said to יהוה, “You are my Ěl; Hear the voice of my prayers, O יהוה.
{140:7} “O Master יהוה, my saving strength, You have screened my head in the day of battle.
{140:8} Do not grant the desires of the wrong, O יהוה; Do not promote his scheme. Selah.”
{140:9} “Those who surround me lift up their head; The trouble of their lips covers them;
{140:10} Let burning coals fall on them; Let them be made to fall into the fire, Into deep pits, let them not rise again.”
{140:11} Let not a slanderer be established in the earth; Let evil hunt the man of violence speedily.
{140:12} I have known that יהוה maintains The cause of the afflicted, The right-ruling of the poor.
{140:13} Only, let the righteous give thanks to Your Name, Let the straight ones dwell in Your presence.
{141:1} יהוה, I have cried out to You; Hasten to me! Give ear to my voice when I cry out to You.
{141:2} Let my prayer be prepared before You as incense, The lifting up of my hands as the evening offering.
{141:3} O יהוה, set a guard for my mouth; Watch over the door of my lips.
{141:4} Let not my heart be inclined to evil, To practise deeds of wrongness With men working wickedness, And let me not eat of their delicacies.
{141:5} Let the righteous one smite me Or reprove me in loving-commitment – It is oil on my head. Let my head not refuse it. My prayer is still against their evil deeds.
{141:6} Their judges have been thrown down By the sides of the rock, But they have heard my words, For they have been pleasant.
{141:7} Our bones are scattered at the mouth of She’ol, As when one ploughs and breaks up the earth.
{141:8} But my eyes are upon You, O Master יהוה. In You I take refuge; Do not pour out my life.
{141:9} Guard me from the clutches Of the trap they have laid for me, And from the snares Of the workers of wickedness.
{141:10} Let the wrong fall into their own nets, While I pass by.
{142:1} I cry out to יהוה with my voice; I pray to יהוה with my voice.
{142:2} I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare before Him my distress.
{142:3} When my spirit grew faint within me, Then You know my path. In the way in which I walk They have hidden a trap for me.
{142:4} Look to the right hand and see, And no one is concerned for me; No refuge remains to me; No one inquires after my being.
{142:5} I cried out to You, O יהוה: I said, “You are my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.
{142:6} “Listen to my cry, For I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they are too strong for me.
{142:7} “Bring my being out of prison, To give thanks to Your Name. Let the righteous gather around me, Because You deal kindly with me.”
{143:1} Hear my prayer, O יהוה, Give ear to my pleadings In Your trustworthiness. Answer me in Your righteousness.
{143:2} And do not enter into right-ruling with Your servant, For before You no one living is in the right.
{143:3} For the enemy has pursued my being; He has crushed my life to the ground; He has made me dwell in dark places, Like the dead of old.
{143:4} Therefore my spirit grew faint within me, My heart within me is stunned.
{143:5} I remembered the days of old; I meditated on all Your works; I ponder on the work of Your hands.
{143:6} I have spread out my hands to You; My being is like a thirsty land for You. Selah.
{143:7} Hasten, answer me, O יהוה; My spirit fails! Do not hide Your face from me, Lest I be like those going down into the pit.
{143:8} Let me hear Your loving-commitment in the morning, For in You I have put my trust; Let me know the way in which I should walk, For I have lifted up my being to You.
{143:9} Deliver me from my enemies, O יהוה; I take refuge in You.
{143:10} Teach me to do Your good pleasure, For You are my Elohim. Let Your good Spirit lead me In the land of straightness.
{143:11} For the sake of Your Name, O יהוה, revive me! In Your righteousness, Bring my being out of distress.
{143:12} And in Your loving-commitment, Cut off my enemies. And destroy all the adversaries of my life, For I am Your servant!
{144:1} Blessed be יהוה my Rock, Who is teaching my hands for fighting, My fingers for battle;
{144:2} My loving-commitment and my stronghold, My tower and my deliverer, My shield, and in whom I take refuge, Who is subduing peoples under me.
{144:3} יהוה, what is man, that You should know him? Son of man, that You should think of him?
{144:4} Man is like a breath, His days like a passing shadow.
{144:5} Incline Your heavens, O יהוה, and come down; Touch the mountains that they smoke.
{144:6} Send forth lightning and scatter them, Send forth Your arrows and confuse them.
{144:7} Send forth Your hand from above; Rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, From the hand of foreigners,
{144:8} Whose mouth has spoken falsehood, And whose right hand is a right hand of lies.
{144:9} O Elohim, a new song I sing to You; On a harp of ten strings I sing praises to You,
{144:10} Who gives deliverance to sovereigns, Who rescues Dawiḏ His servant From the evil sword.
{144:11} Rescue me and deliver me from the hand of foreigners, Whose mouth has spoken falsehood, And whose right hand is a right hand of lies;
{144:12} Because our sons are like plants Grown up in their youth; Our daughters like hewn stones, Polished, like a palace building;
{144:13} Let our storehouses be filled, Supplying all kinds; Let our sheep bring forth thousands And ten thousands in our fields;
{144:14} Our cattle well-laden; No breaking in, no going out; And no crying in our streets.
{144:15} Blessed are the people who have it so; Blessed are the people whose Elohim is יהוה!
{145:1} I exalt You, my Elohim, O Sovereign; And bless Your Name forever and ever.
{145:2} All day long I bless You, And praise Your Name forever and ever.
{145:3} Great is יהוה, and greatly to be praised; And His greatness is unsearchable.
{145:4} Generation after generation praises Your works, And they declare Your mighty acts.
{145:5} I declare the esteemed splendour of Your excellency, And the matters of Your wondrous works.
{145:6} And they speak of the might of Your awesome acts, And I recount Your greatness.
{145:7} They send forth the remembrance of Your great goodness, And they sing of Your righteousness.
{145:8} יהוה shows favour and is compassionate, Patient and great in loving-commitment.
{145:9} יהוה is good to all, And He has compassion on all His works.
{145:10} All Your works give thanks to You, O יהוה, And Your lovingly-committed ones bless You.
{145:11} They speak of the esteem of Your reign, And talk of Your might,
{145:12} To make known to the sons of men His mighty acts, And the esteemed splendour of His reign.
{145:13} Your reign is an everlasting reign, And Your rule is throughout all generations.
{145:14} יהוה is supporting all who are falling, And raising up all who are bowed down.
{145:15} The eyes of all look to You expectantly, And You are giving them their food in its season,
{145:16} Opening Your hand and satisfying The desire of all that live.
{145:17} יהוה is righteous in all His ways, And lovingly-committed in all His works.
{145:18} יהוה is near to all who call upon Him, To all who call upon Him in truth.
{145:19} He does the desire of those who fear Him; And He hears their cry and saves them.
{145:20} יהוה preserves all those loving Him, But all the wrong ones He destroys.
{145:21} My mouth speaks the praise of יהוה, And let all flesh bless His set-apart Name, Forever and ever.
{146:1} Praise Yah! Praise יהוה, O my being!
{146:2} While I live I praise יהוה; I sing praises to my Elohim while I exist.
{146:3} Do not put your trust in princes, In a son of man, in whom is no deliverance.
{146:4} His spirit goes out, he returns to his earth; In that day his plans perish.
{146:5} Blessed is he who has the Ěl of Ya‛aqoḇ for his help, Whose expectancy is in יהוה his Elohim,
{146:6} Maker of the heavens and earth, The sea and all that is in them, Who is guarding truth forever,
{146:7} Doing right-ruling for the oppressed, Giving bread to the hungry. יהוה releases those who are bound,
{146:8} יהוה opens the eyes of the blind, יהוה raises those who are bowed down, יהוה loves the righteous.
{146:9} יהוה guards the strangers, He lifts up the fatherless and widow, But the way of the wrong ones He turns upside down.
{146:10} יהוה reigns forever, O Tsiyon, Your Elohim to all generations. Praise Yah!
{147:1} Praise Yah! For it is good to sing praises to our Elohim. For it is pleasant – praise is fitting.
{147:2} יהוה builds up Yerushalayim, He gathers the outcasts of Yisra’ĕl –
{147:3} He heals the broken-hearted And binds up their wounds.
{147:4} He appoints the number of the stars, He gives names to all of them.
{147:5} Great is our Master and mighty in power, There is no limit to His understanding.
{147:6} יהוה lifts up the meek ones, He throws the wrong ones down to the ground.
{147:7} Respond to יהוה with thanksgiving; Sing praises on a lyre to our Elohim,
{147:8} Who covers the heavens with clouds, Who prepares rain for the earth, Who makes grass to sprout on the mountains,
{147:9} Giving to the beast its food, To the young ravens that cry.
{147:10} He does not delight in the strength of the horse, He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.
{147:11} יהוה takes pleasure in those who fear Him, In those who wait for His loving-commitment.
{147:12} Extol יהוה, O Yerushalayim! Praise your Elohim, O Tsiyon!
{147:13} For He has strengthened the bars of your gates, He has blessed your children in your midst,
{147:14} Who makes peace in your borders, He satisfies you with the finest wheat;
{147:15} Who sends out His command to the earth, His word runs very speedily;
{147:16} Who gives snow like wool, He scatters the frost like ashes;
{147:17} Throwing out His hail like pieces; Who does stand before His cold?
{147:18} He sends out His word and melts them, He causes His wind to blow – the waters flow;
{147:19} Declaring His Word to Ya‛aqoḇ, His laws and His right-rulings to Yisra’ĕl.
{147:20} He has not done so with any nation; And they have not known His right-rulings! Praise Yah!
{148:1} Praise Yah! Praise יהוה from the heavens, Praise Him in the heights!
{148:2} Praise Him, all His messengers; Praise Him, all His hosts!
{148:3} Praise Him, sun and moon; Praise Him, all you stars of light!
{148:4} Praise Him, heavens of heavens, And you waters above the heavens!
{148:5} Let them praise the Name of יהוה, For He commanded and they were created.
{148:6} And He established them forever and ever, He gave a law and they pass not beyond.
{148:7} Praise יהוה from the earth, You great sea creatures and all the depths,
{148:8} Fire and hail, snow and clouds, Stormy wind that does His word,
{148:9} The mountains and all hills, Fruit tree and all cedars,
{148:10} Wild beasts and all cattle, Creeping creatures and flying birds,
{148:11} Sovereigns of the earth and all peoples, Rulers and all judges of the earth,
{148:12} Both young men and maidens, Old men and children.
{148:13} Let them praise the Name of יהוה, For His Name alone is exalted, His splendour is above the earth and heavens.
{148:14} He also lifts up the horn of His people, The praise of all His lovingly-committed ones; Of the children of Yisra’ĕl, A people near to Him. Praise Yah!
{149:1} Praise Yah! Sing to יהוה a new song, His praise in an assembly of lovingly-committed ones.
{149:2} Let Yisra’ĕl rejoice in their Maker; Let the children of Tsiyon exult in their Sovereign.
{149:3} Let them praise His Name in a dance; Let them sing praises to Him with the tambourine and lyre.
{149:4} For יהוה takes pleasure in His people; He embellishes the meek ones with deliverance.
{149:5} Let the lovingly-committed ones exult in esteem; Let them sing aloud on their beds.
{149:6} Let the exaltation of Ěl be in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand,
{149:7} To execute vengeance on the nations, Punishments on the peoples;
{149:8} To bind their sovereigns with chains, And their nobles with iron bands;
{149:9} To execute on them the written right-ruling; A splendour it is for all His lovingly-committed ones. Praise Yah!
{150:1} Praise Yah! Praise Ěl in His set-apart place; Praise Him in His mighty expanse!
{150:2} Praise Him for His mighty acts; Praise Him according to His excellent greatness!
{150:3} Praise Him with the blowing of a shophar; Praise Him with the harp and lyre!
{150:4} Praise Him with tambourine and dance; Praise Him with stringed instruments and flutes!
{150:5} Praise Him with sounding cymbals; Praise Him with resounding cymbals!
{150:6} Let all that has breath praise Yah. Praise Yah!
