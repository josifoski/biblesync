{1:1} And it came to be, after the death of Mosheh the servant of יהוה, that יהוה spoke to Yehoshua son of Nun, the assistant of Mosheh, saying,
{1:2} “Mosheh My servant is dead, so now, arise, pass over this Yardĕn, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, to the children of Yisra’ĕl.
{1:3} “Every place on which the sole of your foot treads I have given you, as I spoke to Mosheh.
{1:4} “From the wilderness and this Leḇanon even as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Ḥittites, and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, is your border.
{1:5} “No man is going to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Mosheh, so I am with you. I do not fail you nor forsake you.
{1:6} “Be strong and courageous, for you are to let this people inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
{1:7} “Only be strong and very courageous, to guard to do according to all the Torah which Mosheh My servant commanded you. Do not turn from it right or left, so that you act wisely wherever you go.
{1:8} “Do not let this Book of the Torah depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you guard to do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and act wisely.
{1:9} “Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid, nor be discouraged, for יהוה your Elohim is with you wherever you go.”
{1:10} And Yehoshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
{1:11} “Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare food for yourselves, for within three days you are passing over this Yardĕn, to go in to possess the land which יהוה your Elohim is giving you to possess.’”
{1:12} And Yehoshua spoke to the Re’uḇĕnites and to the Gaḏites and to half the tribe of Menashsheh, saying,
{1:13} “Remember the word which Mosheh, servant of יהוה, commanded you, saying, ‘יהוה your Elohim is giving you rest, and He shall give you this land.’
{1:14} “Let your wives, your little ones, and your livestock stay in the land which Mosheh gave you beyond the Yardĕn. But you shall pass before your brothers in fives, all your brave fighters, and shall help them,
{1:15} until יהוה has given your brothers rest, as unto you. So shall they also take possession of the land which יהוה your Elohim is giving them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession, and shall possess that which Mosheh the servant of יהוה gave you beyond the Yardĕn toward the rising of the sun.”
{1:16} And they answered Yehoshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we do, and wherever you send us we go.
{1:17} “According to all that we obeyed Mosheh, so we obey you. Only, let יהוה your Elohim be with you, as He was with Mosheh.
{1:18} “Whoever rebels against your mouth and does not obey your words, in all that you command him, is put to death. Only be strong and courageous.”
{2:1} And Yehoshua son of Nun secretly sent out two men from Shittim to spy, saying, “Go, see the land, and Yeriḥo.” And they went, and came to the house of a woman, a whore, and her name was Raḥaḇ, and they lay down there.
{2:2} But it was reported to the sovereign of Yeriḥo, saying, “See, men from the children of Yisra’ĕl have come here tonight to search out the land.”
{2:3} And the sovereign of Yeriḥo sent to Raḥaḇ, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land.”
{2:4} But the woman had taken the two men and hid them. So she said, “The men came to me, but I did not know where they were from.
{2:5} “Then it came to be as the gate was being shut, when it was dark, that the men went out. I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, so that you overtake them.”
{2:6} But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid out on the roof.
{2:7} And the men pursued them by the way to the Yardĕn, to the fords. And they shut the gate afterwards as soon as the pursuers had gone out.
{2:8} And before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof,
{2:9} and she said to the men, “I know that יהוה has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away because of you.
{2:10} “For we have heard how יהוה dried up the water of the Sea of Reeds for you when you came out of Mitsrayim, and what you did to the two sovereigns of the Amorites who were beyond the Yardĕn, Siḥon and Oḡ, whom you put under the ban.
{2:11} “And when we heard, our hearts melted, and there was no spirit left in anyone because of you, for יהוה your Elohim, He is Elohim in the heavens above and on earth beneath.
{2:12} “And now, please swear to me by יהוה, since I have shown you loving-commitment, that you also show loving-commitment to my father’s house, and shall give me a true token,
{2:13} and shall spare my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and shall deliver our lives from death.”
{2:14} And the men said to her, “Our lives for yours, if you do not expose this matter of ours, then it shall be, when יהוה has given us the land, that we shall treat you in loving-commitment and truth.”
{2:15} So she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the city wall and she dwelt on the wall.
{2:16} And she said to them, “Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers come upon you. And you shall hide there three days, until the pursuers have returned, and afterwards go on your way.”
{2:17} And the men said to her, “We are released from this oath of yours which you have made us swear,
{2:18} unless, when we come into the land, you bind this line of scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you bring your father, and your mother, and your brothers, and all your father’s household to your own home.
{2:19} “And it shall be that anyone who goes outside the doors of your house into the street, his blood is on his own head, and we are innocent. And anyone who is with you in the house, his blood is on our head if a hand is laid on him.
{2:20} “And if you expose this matter of ours, then we shall be released from your oath which you made us swear.”
{2:21} And she said, “Let it be according to your words.” And she sent them away, and they went. And she bound the scarlet cord in the window.
{2:22} So they left and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. And the pursuers sought them in all the way, but did not find them.
{2:23} Then the two men returned and came down from the mountain, and passed over. And they came to Yehoshua son of Nun, and related to him all that had befallen them.
{2:24} And they said to Yehoshua, “Truly יהוה has given all the land into our hands, and also, all the inhabitants of the land have melted away because of us.”
{3:1} And Yehoshua rose early in the morning, and they set out from Shittim and came to the Yardĕn, he and all the children of Yisra’ĕl, and stayed there before they passed over.
{3:2} And it came to be, after three days, that the officers went into the midst of the camp,
{3:3} and they commanded the people, saying, “When you see the ark of the covenant of יהוה your Elohim, and the priests, the Lĕwites, bearing it, then you shall set out from your place and follow it.
{3:4} “Only, keep a distance between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near it, so that you know which way to go, for you have not passed over this way before.”
{3:5} And Yehoshua said to the people, “Set yourselves apart, for tomorrow יהוה is doing wonders in your midst.”
{3:6} And Yehoshua spoke to the priests, saying, “Take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people.” So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.
{3:7} And יהוה said to Yehoshua, “This day I begin to make you great before the eyes of all Yisra’ĕl, so that they know that I am with you as I was with Mosheh.
{3:8} “And you, command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you come to the edge of the water of the Yardĕn, stand in the Yardĕn.’”
{3:9} And Yehoshua said to the children of Yisra’ĕl, “Come near, and hear the words of יהוה your Elohim.”
{3:10} And Yehoshua said, “By this you shall know that the living Ěl is in your midst, and that He is certainly driving out from before you the Kena‛anites and the Ḥittites and the Ḥiwwites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Yeḇusites:
{3:11} “See, the ark of the covenant of the Master of all the earth is passing over before you into the Yardĕn.
{3:12} “And now, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Yisra’ĕl, one man from every tribe.
{3:13} “And it shall be, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of יהוה, the Master of all the earth, come to rest in the waters of the Yardĕn, that the waters of the Yardĕn are cut off, the waters that come down from upstream, and stand as a heap.”
{3:14} And it came to be, when the people set out from their tents to pass over the Yardĕn, with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,
{3:15} and as those bearing the ark came to the Yardĕn, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark dipped in the edge of the water – now the Yardĕn overflows all its banks during all the time of harvest –
{3:16} that the waters which came down from upstream stood still, and rose in a heap very far away at Aḏam, the city that is beside Tsarethan. And the waters going down into the Sea of the Araḇah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. And the people passed over opposite Yeriḥo.
{3:17} And the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of יהוה stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Yardĕn. And all Yisra’ĕl passed over on dry ground, until all the nation had completely passed over the Yardĕn.
{4:1} And it came to be, when the entire nation had completely passed over the Yardĕn, that יהוה spoke to Yehoshua, saying,
{4:2} “Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from every tribe,
{4:3} and command them, saying, ‘Take for yourselves twelve stones from here, out of the midst of the Yardĕn, from the place where the priests’ feet stood firm. And you shall bring them with you and leave them in the camp in which you spend the night.’”
{4:4} And Yehoshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the children of Yisra’ĕl, one man from every tribe,
{4:5} and Yehoshua said to them, “Pass over before the ark of יהוה your Elohim into the midst of the Yardĕn, and each one of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl,
{4:6} so that this shall be a sign in your midst when your children ask in time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’
{4:7} “Then you shall answer them that the waters of the Yardĕn were cut off before the ark of the covenant of יהוה. When it passed over the Yardĕn, the waters of the Yardĕn were cut off. And these stones shall be for a remembrance to the children of Yisra’ĕl forever.”
{4:8} And the children of Yisra’ĕl did so, as Yehoshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of the Yardĕn, as יהוה had spoken to Yehoshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and took them over with them to their camp, and laid them down there.
{4:9} Yehoshua also set up twelve stones in the midst of the Yardĕn, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood. And they are there to this day.
{4:10} And the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Yardĕn until every matter was finished that יהוה had commanded Yehoshua to speak to the people, according to all that Mosheh had commanded Yehoshua. And the people hastened and passed over.
{4:11} And it came to be, when all the people had completely passed over, that the ark of יהוה and the priests passed over in the presence of the people.
{4:12} And the sons of Re’uḇĕn, and the sons of Gaḏ, and half the tribe of Menashsheh passed over in fives before the children of Yisra’ĕl, as Mosheh had spoken to them.
{4:13} About forty thousand armed ones of the army passed over before יהוה for battle, to the desert plains of Yeriḥo.
{4:14} On that day יהוה made Yehoshua great before the eyes of all Yisra’ĕl. And they feared him, as they had feared Mosheh, all the days of his life.
{4:15} And יהוה spoke to Yehoshua, saying,
{4:16} “Command the priests who bear the ark of the Witness, and let them come up from the Yardĕn.”
{4:17} And Yehoshua commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Yardĕn.”
{4:18} And it came to be, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of יהוה had come from the midst of the Yardĕn, and the soles of the priests’ feet touched the dry land, that the waters of the Yardĕn returned to their place and flowed over all its banks as before.
{4:19} And the people came up from the Yardĕn on the tenth day of the first new moon, and they camped in Gilgal on the east border of Yeriḥo.
{4:20} And those twelve stones which they took out of the Yardĕn, Yehoshua set up in Gilgal.
{4:21} And he said to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What are these stones?’
{4:22} then you shall let your children know, saying, ‘Yisra’ĕl passed over this Yardĕn on dry land,’
{4:23} for יהוה your Elohim dried up the waters of the Yardĕn before you until you had passed over, as יהוה your Elohim did to the Sea of Reeds, which He dried up before us until we had passed over,
{4:24} so that all the peoples of the earth shall know the hand of יהוה, that it is strong, so that you shall fear יהוה your Elohim forever.”
{5:1} And it came to be, when all the sovereigns of the Amorites who were beyond the Yardĕn westward, and all the sovereigns of the Kena‛anites who were by the sea, heard that יהוה had dried up the waters of the Yardĕn from before the children of Yisra’ĕl until we had passed over, that their heart melted. And there was no spirit in them any longer, because of the children of Yisra’ĕl.
{5:2} At that time יהוה said to Yehoshua, “Make knives of flint for yourself, and circumcise the sons of Yisra’ĕl again the second time.”
{5:3} So Yehoshua made knives of flint for himself, and circumcised the sons of Yisra’ĕl at the Hill of Foreskins.
{5:4} And this is why Yehoshua circumcised them: All the people who came out of Mitsrayim who were males, all the men of battle, had died in the wilderness on the way, after they had come out of Mitsrayim.
{5:5} For all the people who came out had been circumcised, but all the people who were born in the wilderness on the way as they came out of Mitsrayim had not been circumcised.
{5:6} For the children of Yisra’ĕl walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation – the men of battle who came out of Mitsrayim – were consumed, because they did not obey the voice of יהוה, to whom יהוה swore not to show them the land which יהוה had sworn to their fathers that He would give us, “a land flowing with milk and honey.”
{5:7} And Yehoshua circumcised their sons whom He raised up in their place; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.
{5:8} And it came to be, when they had completed circumcising all the nation, that they stayed in their places in the camp till they were healed.
{5:9} And יהוה said to Yehoshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Mitsrayim from you.” So the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.
{5:10} And the children of Yisra’ĕl camped in Gilgal, and performed the Pĕsaḥ on the fourteenth day of the new moon at evening on the desert plains of Yeriḥo.
{5:11} And they ate of the stored grain of the land on the morrow after the Pĕsaḥ, unleavened bread and roasted grain on this same day.
{5:12} And the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten the stored grain of the land. And the children of Yisra’ĕl no longer had manna, but they ate the food of the land of Kena‛an that year.
{5:13} And it came to be, when Yehoshua was by Yeriḥo, that he lifted his eyes and looked and saw a Man standing opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Yehoshua went to Him and said to Him, “Are You for us or for our adversaries?”
{5:14} And He said, “No, for I have now come as Captain of the host of יהוה.” And Yehoshua fell on his face to the earth and did obeisance, and said to Him, “What is my Master saying to His servant?”
{5:15} And the Captain of the host of יהוה said to Yehoshua, “Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you stand is set-apart.” And Yehoshua did so.
{6:1} And Yeriḥo was shut up tight because of the presence of the sons of Yisra’ĕl – none going out, and none coming in.
{6:2} And יהוה said to Yehoshua, “See! I have given Yeriḥo and its sovereign, mighty brave men, into your hand.
{6:3} “And you shall go around the city, all the men of battle going around the city once. Do this for six days.
{6:4} “And let seven priests bear seven shopharot of the yoḇelim before the ark, and on the seventh day go around the city seven times while the priests blow with the shopharot.
{6:5} “And it shall be, when they make a long blast with the horn of a yoḇel, and when you hear the voice of the shophar, that all the people shout with a great sound. And the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.”
{6:6} And Yehoshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven shopharot of yoḇelim before the ark of יהוה.”
{6:7} And he said to the people, “Pass over, and go around the city, and let him who is armed pass over before the ark of יהוה.”
{6:8} And it came to be, when Yehoshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven shopharot of the yoḇelim before יהוה passed over and blew with the shopharot, and the ark of the covenant of יהוה went after them.
{6:9} And the armed men went before the priests who blew the shopharot, and the rear guard came after the ark, going on and blowing with the shopharot.
{6:10} But Yehoshua had commanded the people, saying, “Do not make a sound or cause your voice to be heard, nor let any word come out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, ‘Shout!’ Then you shall shout.”
{6:11} And the ark of יהוה went around the city, going around once. And they came into the camp and stayed in the camp.
{6:12} And Yehoshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of יהוה.
{6:13} And seven priests bearing seven shopharot of the yoḇelim before the ark of יהוה were walking, going on, and they blew with the shopharot, and the armed men went before them. But the rear guard came after the ark of יהוה, going on, and blowing with the shopharot.
{6:14} And the second day they went around the city once and returned to the camp. Thus they did six days.
{6:15} And it came to be on the seventh day that they rose early, about the dawning of the day, and went around the city seven times in this way. Only on that day they went around the city seven times.
{6:16} And it came to be at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the shopharot, that Yehoshua said to the people, “Shout, for יהוה has given you the city!
{6:17} “And the city shall be put under the ban, it and all that is in it belongs to יהוה. Only Raḥaḇ the whore is to live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
{6:18} “And you, by all means guard yourselves from that which is under the ban, lest you come under the ban when you take of that which is under the ban, and make the camp of Yisra’ĕl a curse, and shall trouble it.
{6:19} “But all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are set-apart to יהוה, they go into the treasury of יהוה.”
{6:20} And the people shouted when the priests blew the shopharot. And it came to be when the people heard the voice of the shophar, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat. And the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city.
{6:21} And they put under the ban all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.
{6:22} And to the two men who had spied out the land Yehoshua said, “Go into the house of the woman, the whore, and from there bring out the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her.”
{6:23} And the young men, the spies, went in and brought out Raḥaḇ, and her father, and her mother, and her brothers, and all that she had. So they brought out all her relatives and set them outside the camp of Yisra’ĕl.
{6:24} And they burned the city and all that was in it with fire. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the House of יהוה.
{6:25} However, Yehoshua kept alive Raḥaḇ the whore, and her father’s household, and all that she had. And she dwelt in the midst of Yisra’ĕl to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Yehoshua sent to spy out Yeriḥo.
{6:26} And Yehoshua warned them at that time, saying, “Cursed is the man before יהוה who rises up and builds this city Yeriḥo – he lays its foundation with his first-born, and with his youngest he sets up its gates.”
{6:27} And יהוה was with Yehoshua, and a report about him was in all the land.
{7:1} But the children of Yisra’ĕl committed a trespass regarding that which is under the ban, for Aḵan son of Karmi, son of Zaḇdi, son of Zeraḥ, of the tribe of Yehuḏah, took of that which is under the ban. And the displeasure of יהוה burned against the children of Yisra’ĕl.
{7:2} Now Yehoshua sent men from Yeriḥo to Ai, which is beside Bĕyth Awen, on the east side of Bĕyth Ěl, and spoke to them, saying, “Go up and spy out the land.” And the men went up and spied out Ai.
{7:3} And they returned to Yehoshua and said to him, “Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Do not make all the people toil up there, for the people of Ai are few.”
{7:4} And about three thousand men went up there from the people, but they fled before the men of Ai.
{7:5} And the men of Ai struck about thirty-six men, for they pursued them from before the gate as far as Sheḇarim, and smote them on the descent. So the hearts of the people melted and became like water.
{7:6} And Yehoshua tore his garments, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of יהוה until evening, both he and the elders of Yisra’ĕl, and they put dust on their heads.
{7:7} And Yehoshua said, “Oh Master יהוה, why have You brought this people over the Yardĕn at all, to give us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay beyond the Yardĕn!
{7:8} “O יהוה, what do I say when Yisra’ĕl turns its back before its enemies,
{7:9} and the Kena‛anites and all the inhabitants of the land hear, and shall surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. What then do You do for Your great Name?”
{7:10} And יהוה said to Yehoshua, “Rise up! Why are you lying on your face?
{7:11} “Yisra’ĕl has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. And they have even taken some of that which is under the ban, and have both stolen and deceived, and also put it among their own goods.
{7:12} “And the sons of Yisra’ĕl shall not be able to stand before their enemies. They are going to turn their backs before their enemies, for they have become accursed. I am not with you any more, unless you destroy that which is under the ban from your midst.
{7:13} “Rise up, set the people apart, and you shall say, ‘Set yourselves apart for tomorrow, because thus said יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, “That which is under the ban is in your midst, O Yisra’ĕl. You are not able to stand before your enemies until you put away that which is under the ban out of your midst.”
{7:14} And you shall be brought near in the morning, according to your tribes. And it shall be, the tribe which יהוה takes comes according to clans. And the clan which יהוה takes comes by households. And the household which יהוה takes comes by men.
{7:15} And it shall be that he who is taken with that which is under the ban is burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of יהוה, and because he has committed wickedness in Yisra’ĕl.’”
{7:16} So Yehoshua arose early in the morning and brought Yisra’ĕl by their tribes, and the tribe of Yehuḏah was taken,
{7:17} and he brought the clan of Yehuḏah, and he took the clan of the Zarḥites. And he brought the clan of the Zarḥites by men, and Zaḇdi was taken.
{7:18} And he brought his household by men, and Aḵan son of Karmi, son of Zaḇdi, son of Zeraḥ, of the tribe of Yehuḏah, was taken.
{7:19} Then Yehoshua said to Aḵan, “My son, now give esteem to יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, and make confession to Him. And please declare to me what you have done, do not hide it from me.”
{7:20} So Aḵan answered Yehoshua and said, “Truly, I have sinned against יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, and this is what I did:
{7:21} “When I saw among the spoil a lovely garment from Shin‛ar, and two hundred sheqels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty sheqels, I coveted them and took them. And see, they are hidden in the ground in the midst of my tent, with the silver under it.”
{7:22} And Yehoshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. And see, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under it.
{7:23} And they took them from the midst of the tent, brought them to Yehoshua and to all the children of Yisra’ĕl, and laid them out before יהוה.
{7:24} Then Yehoshua, and all Yisra’ĕl with him, took Aḵan son of Zeraḥ, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his donkeys, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had, and they brought them to the Valley of Aḵor.
{7:25} And Yehoshua said, “Why have you troubled us? יהוה does trouble you today!” Then all Yisra’ĕl stoned him with stones. And they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.
{7:26} And they raised over him a great heap of stones, which remains to this day. Then יהוה turned from the fierceness of His displeasure. Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Aḵor to this day.
{8:1} And יהוה said to Yehoshua, “Do not be afraid, nor be discouraged. Take all the soldiers with you, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into your hand the sovereign of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land.
{8:2} “So you shall do to Ai and its sovereign as you did to Yeriḥo and its sovereign. Only its spoil and its livestock you take as plunder for yourselves. Set for yourselves an ambush for the city, behind it.”
{8:3} And Yehoshua and all the soldiers rose up, to go up to Ai. And Yehoshua chose thirty thousand mighty brave men and sent them away by night,
{8:4} and commanded them, saying, “See, you are going to lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you shall be prepared,
{8:5} while I and all the people who are with me approach the city. And it shall be, when they come out against us, as formerly, that we shall flee before them,
{8:6} and they shall come out after us till we have drawn them from the city, as though saying, ‘They are fleeing before us as formerly.’ And we shall flee before them,
{8:7} then you shall rise from the ambush and seize the city. And יהוה your Elohim shall give it into your hand.
{8:8} “And it shall be, when you capture the city, that you burn the city with fire. Do according to the word of יהוה. See, I have commanded you.”
{8:9} And Yehoshua sent them out. And they went to lie in ambush, and stayed between Bĕyth Ěl and Ai, on the west side of Ai. But Yehoshua stayed that night in the midst of the people.
{8:10} And Yehoshua rose up early in the morning and inspected the people, and went up, he and the elders of Yisra’ĕl, before the people to Ai.
{8:11} And all the soldiers who were with him went up and drew near, and came before the city and camped on the north side of Ai, with the valley between them and Ai.
{8:12} And he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bĕyth Ěl and Ai, on the west side of the city.
{8:13} So they stationed the people, all the army that was on the north of the city, and its rear guard on the west of the city, and Yehoshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
{8:14} And it came to be, when the sovereign of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hastened and rose up early and went out against Yisra’ĕl to battle, he and all his people, at an appointed place before the desert plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
{8:15} And Yehoshua and all Yisra’ĕl let themselves be beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
{8:16} And all the people who were in Ai were called together to pursue them. And they pursued Yehoshua and were drawn away from the city.
{8:17} So there was not a man left in Ai or Bĕyth Ěl who did not go out after Yisra’ĕl, and they left the city open and pursued Yisra’ĕl.
{8:18} And יהוה said to Yehoshua, “Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai, for I give it into your hand.” And Yehoshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city,
{8:19} and the ambush rose up quickly from their place, and they ran at the stretching out of his hand, and entered the city and took it, and hastened to burn the city with fire.
{8:20} And the men of Ai looked behind them and saw the smoke of the city rising to the heavens. And there was no power in them to flee this way or that way, for the people who had fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.
{8:21} For when Yehoshua and all Yisra’ĕl saw that the ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city went up, they turned back and struck the men of Ai.
{8:22} The others also came out of the city against them, so they were in the midst of Yisra’ĕl, some on this side and some on that side. And they struck them until none were left, and none had escaped.
{8:23} But the sovereign of Ai they caught alive, and brought him to Yehoshua.
{8:24} And it came to be, when Yisra’ĕl ended killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness where they pursued them, and when they all had fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, that all Yisra’ĕl returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword.
{8:25} And it came to be that all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand – all men of Ai.
{8:26} And Yehoshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the spear, until he had put all the inhabitants of Ai under the ban.
{8:27} Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Yisra’ĕl took as booty for themselves, according to the word of יהוה which He had commanded Yehoshua.
{8:28} And Yehoshua burned Ai and made it a heap forever, a ruin to this day.
{8:29} And he hanged the sovereign of Ai on a tree until evening. And at sunset Yehoshua commanded that they should take his corpse down from the tree, and throw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raise over it a great heap of stones, to this day.
{8:30} And Yehoshua built a slaughter-place to יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl in Mount Ěyḇal,
{8:31} as Mosheh the servant of יהוה had commanded the children of Yisra’ĕl, as it is written in the Book of the Torah of Mosheh, “a slaughter-place of unhewn stones over which no man has wielded iron.” And they offered on it ascending offerings to יהוה, and slaughtered peace offerings.
{8:32} And there, in the presence of the children of Yisra’ĕl, he wrote on the stones a copy of the Torah of Mosheh, which he had written.
{8:33} And all Yisra’ĕl – the sojourner as well as the native – with their elders and officers and judges, stood on either side of the ark before the priests, the Lĕwites, who bore the ark of the covenant of יהוה. Half of them were in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ěyḇal, as Mosheh the servant of יהוה had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Yisra’ĕl.
{8:34} And afterward he read all the words of the Torah, the blessings and the cursings, according to all that is written in the Book of the Torah.
{8:35} There was not a word of all that Mosheh had commanded which Yehoshua did not read before all the assembly of Yisra’ĕl, with the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who accompanied them.
{9:1} And it came to be, when all the sovereigns who were beyond the Yardĕn, in the hills and in the low country and in all the coasts of the Great Sea toward Leḇanon – the Ḥittite and the Amorite, the Kena‛anite and the Perizzite, the Ḥiwwite and the Yeḇusite – heard,
{9:2} they gathered together to fight with Yehoshua and Yisra’ĕl with one accord.
{9:3} And the inhabitants of Giḇ‛on heard what Yehoshua had done to Yeriḥo and Ai,
{9:4} and they acted slyly and went and pretended to be envoys. And they took old sacks on their donkeys, old wineskins torn and mended,
{9:5} and old and patched sandals on their feet, and old garments on themselves. And all the bread of their provision was dry, it was crumbs.
{9:6} And they went to Yehoshua, to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Yisra’ĕl, “We have come from a far land, and now, make a covenant with us.”
{9:7} But the men of Yisra’ĕl said to the Ḥiwwites, “It could be that you dwell in our midst, so how would we make a covenant with you?”
{9:8} And they said to Yehoshua, “We are your servants.” And Yehoshua said to them, “Who are you, and where do you come from?”
{9:9} So they said to him, “From a land very far off your servants have come, because of the Name of יהוה your Elohim. For we have heard the report of Him, and all that He did in Mitsrayim,
{9:10} and all that He had done to the two sovereigns of the Amorites who were beyond the Yardĕn, to Siḥon sovereign of Ḥeshbon, and Oḡ sovereign of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
{9:11} “So our elders and all the inhabitants of our land spoke to us, saying, ‘Take food with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, “We are your servants, and now, make a covenant with us.”’
{9:12} “This bread of ours we took hot for our provision from our houses on the day that we left to come to you. But now, see, it is dry and it is crumby.
{9:13} “And these wineskins which we filled were new, and see, they are torn. And these our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey.”
{9:14} And the men of Yisra’ĕl took some of their food, but they did not ask the mouth of יהוה.
{9:15} And Yehoshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them to let them live, and the rulers of the congregation swore to them.
{9:16} And it came to be at the end of three days, after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours who dwelt near them.
{9:17} And the children of Yisra’ĕl set out and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Giḇ‛on, and Kephirah, and Be’ĕroth, and Qiryath Ye‛arim.
{9:18} But the children of Yisra’ĕl did not strike them, because the rulers of the congregation had sworn to them by יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl. And all the congregation grumbled against the rulers.
{9:19} But all the rulers said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, and we are unable to touch them now.
{9:20} “Let us do this to them: We shall keep them alive, lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore to them.”
{9:21} And the rulers said to them, “Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the rulers had promised them.”
{9:22} Then Yehoshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ yet you are dwelling in our midst?
{9:23} “And now you are cursed, and you shall not cease from being slaves, and woodcutters and drawers of water for the House of my Elohim.”
{9:24} And they answered Yehoshua and said, “Your servants were clearly told that יהוה your Elohim commanded His servant Mosheh to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you. So we were very much afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this deed.
{9:25} “And now, see, we are in your hands. Do with us as it seems good and right to do to us.”
{9:26} And he did so to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and they did not kill them.
{9:27} And that day Yehoshua made them woodcutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for the slaughter-place of יהוה, even to this day, at the place that He should choose.
{10:1} And it came to be when Aḏoni-Tseḏeq sovereign of Yerushalayim heard that Yehoshua had captured Ai and had put it under the ban, that he had done to Ai and its sovereign as he had done to Yeriḥo and its sovereign, and that the inhabitants of Giḇ‛on had made peace with Yisra’ĕl and were in their midst,
{10:2} that they feared greatly, because Giḇ‛on was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.
{10:3} And Aḏoni-Tseḏeq sovereign of Yerushalayim sent to Hoham sovereign of Ḥeḇron, and to Piram sovereign of Yarmuth, and to Yaphiya sovereign of Laḵish, and to Deḇir sovereign of Eḡlon, saying,
{10:4} “Come up to me and help me, and let us strike Giḇ‛on, for it has made peace with Yehoshua and with the children of Yisra’ĕl.”
{10:5} So the five sovereigns of the Amorites – the sovereign of Yerushalayim, the sovereign of Ḥeḇron, the sovereign of Yarmuth, the sovereign of Laḵish, the sovereign of Eḡlon – gathered together and went up, they and all their armies, and camped before Giḇ‛on and fought against it.
{10:6} And the men of Giḇ‛on sent to Yehoshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Do not withdraw your hand from your servants. Come up to us quickly, and save us and help us, for all the sovereigns of the Amorites who dwell in the mountains have assembled against us.”
{10:7} And Yehoshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the soldiers with him, and all the mighty brave men.
{10:8} And יהוה said to Yehoshua, “Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hand. Not one of them does stand before you.”
{10:9} So then Yehoshua came upon them suddenly, having gone up all night from Gilgal.
{10:10} And יהוה threw them into confusion before Yisra’ĕl, and they struck them with a great slaughter at Giḇ‛on, and pursued them along the way that goes to Bĕyth Ḥoron, and struck them as far as Azĕqah and Maqqĕḏah.
{10:11} And it came to be, as they fled before Yisra’ĕl and were on the descent of Bĕyth Ḥoron, that יהוה threw down large hailstones from the heavens on them as far as Azĕqah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than those whom the sons of Yisra’ĕl had killed with the sword.
{10:12} Then Yehoshua spoke to יהוה in the day when יהוה gave the Amorites over to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and he said before the eyes of Yisra’ĕl, “Sun, stand still over Giḇ‛on; and moon, in the Valley of Ayalon.”
{10:13} So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself upon their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Yashar? Thus the sun stopped in the midst of the heavens, and did not hasten to go down for an entire day.
{10:14} And there has been no day like that, before it or after it, that יהוה listened to the voice of a man, because יהוה fought for Yisra’ĕl.
{10:15} So Yehoshua returned, and all Yisra’ĕl with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
{10:16} Now these five sovereigns had fled and hidden themselves in a cave at Maqqĕḏah.
{10:17} And it was reported to Yehoshua, saying, “The five sovereigns have been found hidden in the cave at Maqqĕḏah.”
{10:18} And Yehoshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them.
{10:19} “And you, do not stand still, but pursue your enemies. And you shall smite them in the rear. Do not allow them to enter their cities, for יהוה your Elohim has given them into your hand.”
{10:20} And it came to be, when Yehoshua and the children of Yisra’ĕl had ended striking them with a very great slaughter, till they had finished – but those who escaped went into walled cities –
{10:21} that all the people returned to the camp, to Yehoshua at Maqqĕḏah, in peace. No one moved his tongue against any of the sons of Yisra’ĕl.
{10:22} Then Yehoshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five sovereigns to me from the cave.”
{10:23} And they did so, and brought those five sovereigns to him from the cave: the sovereign of Yerushalayim, the sovereign of Ḥeḇron, the sovereign of Yarmuth, the sovereign of Laḵish, the sovereign of Eḡlon.
{10:24} And it came to be, when they brought out those sovereigns to Yehoshua, that Yehoshua called for all the men of Yisra’ĕl, and said to the chiefs of the men of battle who went with him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these sovereigns.” And they drew near and put their feet on their necks.
{10:25} Then Yehoshua said to them, “Do not be afraid nor be discouraged, be strong and courageous, for this is what יהוה is going to do to all your enemies whom you are fighting.”
{10:26} And afterward Yehoshua struck them and killed them, and hanged them on five trees. And they were hanging on the trees until evening.
{10:27} And it came to be, at the time of the going down of the sun, that Yehoshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and threw them into the cave where they had been hidden, and laid large stones against the cave’s mouth, to this day.
{10:28} And on that day Yehoshua captured Maqqĕḏah, and he struck it with the edge of the sword, and he put its sovereign under the ban – them and all the people who were in it, he left no survivor. And he did to the sovereign of Maqqĕḏah as he had done to the sovereign of Yeriḥo.
{10:29} Then Yehoshua passed over, and all Yisra’ĕl with him, from Maqqĕḏah to Liḇnah. And they fought against Liḇnah.
{10:30} And יהוה also gave it and its sovereign into the hand of Yisra’ĕl. And he struck it and all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword, he left no survivor in it. And he did to its sovereign as he had done to the sovereign of Yeriḥo.
{10:31} Then Yehoshua passed over, and all Yisra’ĕl with him, from Liḇnah to Laḵish, and encamped against it and fought against it.
{10:32} And יהוה gave Laḵish into the hand of Yisra’ĕl, who captured it on the second day, and struck it and all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword, according to all that he had done to Liḇnah.
{10:33} Then Horam sovereign of Gezer came up to help Laḵish. And Yehoshua struck him and his people, until he left him no survivor.
{10:34} Then Yehoshua passed over, and all Yisra’ĕl with him, from Laḵish to Eḡlon. And they encamped against it and fought against it,
{10:35} and captured it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword. And all the beings who were in it he put under the ban that day, according to all that he had done to Laḵish.
{10:36} Then Yehoshua went up, and all Yisra’ĕl with him, from Eḡlon to Ḥeḇron, and they fought against it,
{10:37} and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its sovereign, and all its cities, and all the people who were in it. He left no survivor, according to all that he had done to Eḡlon, but put it and all the people who were in it under the ban.
{10:38} Then Yehoshua returned, and all Yisra’ĕl with him, to Deḇir, and fought against it,
{10:39} and captured it and its sovereign and all its cities. And they struck them with the edge of the sword and put all the people who were in it under the ban, he left no survivor. As he had done to Ḥeḇron, so he did to Deḇir and its sovereign, as he had done also to Liḇnah and its sovereign.
{10:40} Thus Yehoshua struck all the land: the mountain country and the South and the low country and the wilderness slopes, and all their sovereigns. He left no survivor, but put all that breathed under the ban, as יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl had commanded.
{10:41} And Yehoshua struck them from Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa as far as Azzah, and all the land of Goshen, even as far as Giḇ‛on.
{10:42} And Yehoshua captured all these sovereigns and their land at one time, because יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl fought for Yisra’ĕl.
{10:43} And Yehoshua returned, and all Yisra’ĕl with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
{11:1} And it came to be, when Yaḇin sovereign of Ḥatsor heard, that he sent to Yoḇaḇ sovereign of Maḏon, and to the sovereign of Shimron, and to the sovereign of Aḵshaph,
{11:2} and to the sovereigns who were from the north, in the mountains, and in the desert plain south of Kinneroth, and in the low country, and in the heights of Dor on the west –
{11:3} the Kena‛anites in the east and in the west, and the Amorite, and the Ḥittite, and the Perizzite, and the Yeḇusite in the mountains, and the Ḥiwwite below Ḥermon in the land of Mitspah.
{11:4} And they went out, they and all their armies with them, as many people as numerous as the sand on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots.
{11:5} And all these sovereigns met together, and they came and camped together at the waters of Mĕrom to fight against Yisra’ĕl.
{11:6} And יהוה said to Yehoshua, “Do not be afraid of their presence, for tomorrow about this time I am giving all of them over to Yisra’ĕl, slain. Hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.”
{11:7} And Yehoshua, and all the soldiers with him, came against them suddenly by the waters of Mĕrom, and they fell on them.
{11:8} And יהוה gave them into the hand of Yisra’ĕl, and they struck them and pursued them to Great Tsiḏon, and to Misrephoth Mayim, and to the Valley of Mitspeh eastward. And they struck them until no survivor was left to them.
{11:9} And Yehoshua did to them as יהוה said to him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
{11:10} And Yehoshua turned back at that time and captured Ḥatsor, and struck its sovereign with the sword, for Ḥatsor was formerly the head of all those reigns.
{11:11} And they struck all the beings who were in it with the edge of the sword, putting them under the ban. He did not leave anyone breathing. Then he burned Ḥatsor with fire.
{11:12} And Yehoshua captured all the cities of those sovereigns, and all their sovereigns, and he struck them with the edge of the sword. He put them under the ban, as Mosheh the servant of יהוה commanded.
{11:13} However, Yisra’ĕl did not burn any cities that stood on their mounds, but Yehoshua burned only Ḥatsor.
{11:14} And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock, the children of Yisra’ĕl took as booty for themselves. But they struck every man with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, and they did not leave anyone breathing.
{11:15} As יהוה had commanded Mosheh his servant, so Mosheh commanded Yehoshua, and so Yehoshua did. He did not turn aside a word of all that יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
{11:16} Thus Yehoshua took all this land: the mountain country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the low country, and the desert plain, and the mountains of Yisra’ĕl and its low lands,
{11:17} from Mount Ḥalaq that goes up to Sĕ‛ir, and as far as Ba‛al Gaḏ in the Valley of Leḇanon below Mount Ḥermon. And he captured all their sovereigns, and struck them and killed them.
{11:18} Yehoshua fought with all those sovereigns for a long time.
{11:19} There was not a city that made peace with the children of Yisra’ĕl, except the Ḥiwwites, the inhabitants of Giḇ‛on. All the others they took in battle.
{11:20} For it was of יהוה to strengthen their hearts, that they should come against Yisra’ĕl in battle, in order to put them under the ban, so that they might have no favour, but that He might annihilate them, as יהוה had commanded Mosheh.
{11:21} And at that time Yehoshua came and cut off the Anaqim from the mountains, from Ḥeḇron, from Deḇir, from Anaḇ, and from all the mountains of Yehuḏah, and from all the mountains of Yisra’ĕl. Yehoshua put them with their cities under the ban.
{11:22} There were none of the Anaqim left in the land of the children of Yisra’ĕl; only in Azzah, in Gath, and in Ashdoḏ some remained.
{11:23} Thus Yehoshua took the entire land, according to all that יהוה had said to Mosheh. And Yehoshua gave it as an inheritance to Yisra’ĕl according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from fighting.
{12:1} And these are the sovereigns of the land whom the children of Yisra’ĕl struck, and whose land they possessed beyond the Yardĕn towards the sun-rising, from the wadi Arnon to Mount Ḥermon, and all the desert plain eastward:
{12:2} Siḥon sovereign of the Amorites, who dwelt in Ḥeshbon, ruling from Aro‛ĕr, which is on the bank of the wadi Arnon, from the middle of that wadi, and half Gil‛aḏ, even as far as the wadi Yabboq, the border of the children of Ammon,
{12:3} and the desert plain from the Sea of Kinneroth eastward as far as the Sea of the Araḇah, the Salt Sea, the way to Bĕyth Yeshimoth, and southward below the slopes of Pisgah,
{12:4} and the border of Oḡ, sovereign of Bashan, who was of the remnant of the Repha’ites, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Eḏre‛i,
{12:5} and ruled in Mount Ḥermon, and in Salḵah, and in all Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Ma‛aḵathites, and the half of Gil‛aḏ as far as the border of Siḥon sovereign of Ḥeshbon.
{12:6} Mosheh the servant of יהוה and the children of Yisra’ĕl had stricken them. And Mosheh the servant of יהוה had given it as a possession to the Re’uḇĕnites, and to the Gaḏites, and to half the tribe of Menashsheh.
{12:7} And these are the sovereigns of the land which Yehoshua and the children of Yisra’ĕl struck beyond the Yardĕn, on the west, from Ba‛al Gaḏ in the Valley of Leḇanon as far as Mount Ḥalaq that goes up to Sĕ‛ir, which Yehoshua gave to the tribes of Yisra’ĕl as a possession according to their divisions,
{12:8} in the mountain country, and in the low country, and in the desert plain, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South, the Ḥittites, the Amorites and the Kena‛anites, the Perizzites, the Ḥiwwites, and the Yeḇusites:
{12:9} the sovereign of Yeriḥo, one; the sovereign of Ai, which is beside Bĕyth Ěl, one;
{12:10} the sovereign of Yerushalayim, one; the sovereign of Ḥeḇron, one;
{12:11} the sovereign of Yarmuth, one; the sovereign of Laḵish, one;
{12:12} the sovereign of Eḡlon, one; the sovereign of Gezer, one;
{12:13} the sovereign of Deḇir, one; the sovereign of Geḏer, one;
{12:14} the sovereign of Ḥormah, one; the sovereign of Araḏ, one;
{12:15} the sovereign of Liḇnah, one; the sovereign of Aḏullam, one;
{12:16} the sovereign of Maqqĕḏah, one; the sovereign of Bĕyth Ěl, one;
{12:17} the sovereign of Tappuwaḥ, one; the sovereign of Ḥĕpher, one;
{12:18} the sovereign of Aphĕq, one; the sovereign of Sharon, one;
{12:19} the sovereign of Maḏon, one; the sovereign of Ḥatsor, one;
{12:20} the sovereign of Shimron Mĕron, one; the sovereign of Aḵshaph, one;
{12:21} the sovereign of Ta‛anaḵ, one; the sovereign of Meḡiddo, one;
{12:22} the sovereign of Qeḏesh, one; the sovereign of Yoqne‛am in Karmel, one;
{12:23} the sovereign of Dor in the heights of Dor, one; the sovereign of the nations of Gilgal, one;
{12:24} the sovereign of Tirtsah, one – thirty-one sovereigns in all.
{13:1} And Yehoshua was old, advanced in years. And יהוה said to him, “You are old, advanced in years, and still much of the land remains to be possessed.
{13:2} “This is the land that remains: all the districts of the Philistines and all the Geshurites,
{13:3} from Shiḥor which is in front of Mitsrayim, and up to the border of Eqron northward, are considered as Kena‛anite – the five princes of the Philistines, the Azzathites, and the Ashdoḏites, the Eshqelonites, the Gittites, and the Eqronites; also the Awwites
{13:4} on the south; all the land of the Kena‛anites, and Me‛arah that belongs to the Tsiḏonians as far as Aphĕq, to the border of the Amorites;
{13:5} and the land of the Geḇalites, and all Leḇanon, toward the sunrise, from Ba‛al Gaḏ below Mount Ḥermon as far as the entrance to Ḥamath;
{13:6} all the inhabitants of the mountains from Leḇanon as far as Misrephoth Mayim, and all the Tsiḏonians. I Myself drive them out from before the children of Yisra’ĕl. Only, divide it by lot to Yisra’ĕl as an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
{13:7} “And now, divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Menashsheh.”
{13:8} With them the other half tribe the Re’uḇĕnites and the Gaḏites received their inheritance, which Mosheh had given them, beyond the Yardĕn eastward, as Mosheh the servant of יהוה had given them:
{13:9} from Aro‛ĕr which is on the bank of the wadi Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the wadi, and all the plain of Mĕyḏeḇa as far as Diḇon;
{13:10} and all the cities of Siḥon sovereign of the Amorites, who reigned in Ḥeshbon, as far as the border of the children of Ammon;
{13:11} and Gil‛aḏ, and the border of the Geshurites, and of the Ma‛aḵathites, and all Mount Ḥermon, and all Bashan as far as Salḵah;
{13:12} all the reign of Oḡ in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Eḏre‛i, who remained of the remnant of the Repha’ites, for Mosheh had stricken and dispossessed them.
{13:13} However, the children of Yisra’ĕl did not drive out the Geshurites nor the Ma‛aḵathites, so the Geshurites and the Ma‛aḵathites dwell in the midst of Yisra’ĕl to this day.
{13:14} Only to the tribe of Lĕwi he had given no inheritance – the offerings made by fire to יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl were their inheritance, as He said to them.
{13:15} And Mosheh gave to the tribe of the children of Re’uḇĕn, for their clans:
{13:16} and their border was from Aro‛ĕr, which is on the bank of the wadi Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the wadi, and all the plain by Mĕyḏeḇa,
{13:17} Ḥeshbon and all its cities that are in the plain: Diḇon, and Bamoth Ba‛al, and Bĕyth Ba‛al Me‛on,
{13:18} and Yahtsah, and Qeḏĕmoth, and Mĕpha‛ath,
{13:19} and Qiryathayim, and Siḇmah, and Tsereth Shaḥar on the mountain of the valley,
{13:20} and Bĕyth Pe‛or, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Bĕyth Yeshimoth;
{13:21} and all the cities of the plain, and all the reign of Siḥon sovereign of the Amorites, who reigned in Ḥeshbon, whom Mosheh had stricken with the princes of Miḏyan: Ewi, and Reqem, and Tsur, and Ḥur, and Reḇa, princes of Siḥon dwelling in the land.
{13:22} And the sons of Yisra’ĕl killed with the sword Bil‛am son of Be‛or, the diviner, among those who were killed by them.
{13:23} And the border of the children of Re’uḇĕn was the bank of the Yardĕn. This was the inheritance of the children of Re’uḇĕn for their clans, the cities and their villages.
{13:24} And Mosheh gave to the tribe of Gaḏ, to the children of Gaḏ for their clans:
{13:25} and their border was Ya‛zĕr, and all the cities of Gil‛aḏ, and half the land of the children of Ammon as far as Aro‛ĕr, which is before Rabbah,
{13:26} and from Ḥeshbon to Ramath Mitspeh and Betonim, and from Maḥanayim to the border of Deḇir,
{13:27} and in the valley Bĕyth Haram, and Bĕyth Nimrah, and Sukkoth, and Tsaphon, the rest of the reign of Siḥon sovereign of Ḥeshbon, the Yardĕn being its border, as far as the edge of the Sea of Kinnereth, beyond the Yardĕn eastward.
{13:28} This is the inheritance of the children of Gaḏ for their clans, the cities and their villages.
{13:29} And Mosheh gave to half the tribe of Menashsheh, and it was for half the tribe of the children of Menashsheh for their clans:
{13:30} and their border was from Maḥanayim, all Bashan, all the reign of Oḡ sovereign of Bashan, and all the small towns of Ya’ir which are in Bashan, sixty cities;
{13:31} and the half of Gil‛aḏ, and Ashtaroth and Eḏre‛i, cities of the reign of Oḡ in Bashan, were for the children of Maḵir son of Menashsheh, to the half of the children of Maḵir for their clans.
{13:32} These Mosheh gave as an inheritance in the desert plains of Mo’aḇ beyond the Yardĕn, by Yeriḥo eastward.
{13:33} But to the tribe of Lĕwi Mosheh gave no inheritance. יהוה, Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, He was their inheritance, as He had said to them.
{14:1} Now these the children of Yisra’ĕl inherited in the land of Kena‛an, which El‛azar the priest, and Yehoshua son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl caused them to inherit.
{14:2} Their inheritance was by lot, as יהוה had commanded by the hand of Mosheh, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe.
{14:3} For Mosheh had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Yardĕn, but to the Lĕwites he gave no inheritance in their midst.
{14:4} For the children of Yosĕph had become two tribes: Menashsheh and Ephrayim. And they gave no part to the Lĕwites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their open land for their livestock and their possessions.
{14:5} As יהוה had commanded Mosheh, so the children of Yisra’ĕl did, and they divided the land.
{14:6} And the children of Yehuḏah came to Yehoshua in Gilgal, and Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh the Qenizzite said to him, “You know the word which יהוה said to Mosheh the man of Elohim concerning you and me in Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa.
{14:7} “I was forty years old when Mosheh the servant of יהוה sent me from Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa to spy out the land, and I brought back word to him as it was in my heart.
{14:8} “But my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt, but I followed יהוה my Elohim completely.
{14:9} “So Mosheh swore on that day, saying, ‘The land on which your foot has trodden is your inheritance and your children’s forever, because you have followed יהוה my Elohim completely.’
{14:10} “And now, see, יהוה has kept me alive, as He said, these forty-five years since יהוה spoke this word to Mosheh while Yisra’ĕl walked in the wilderness. And now, see, I am eighty-five years old today.
{14:11} “Yet I am still as strong today as I was on the day that Mosheh sent me. As my strength was then, so my strength is now, for battle, and for going out and for coming in.
{14:12} “And now, give me this mountain of which יהוה spoke in that day, for you heard in that day how the Anaqim were there, and that the cities were great and walled. If יהוה is with me, then I shall dispossess them, as יהוה said.”
{14:13} Yehoshua then blessed him, and gave Ḥeḇron to Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh as an inheritance.
{14:14} So Ḥeḇron became the inheritance of Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh the Qenizzite to this day, because he followed יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl completely.
{14:15} Now the name of Ḥeḇron was formerly Qiryath Arba ( Arba was the greatest man among the Anaqim). And the land had rest from fighting.
{15:1} And the lot of the tribe of the children of Yehuḏah for their clans was to the border of Eḏom, the Wilderness of Tsin southward in the extreme south.
{15:2} And their southern border began at the edge of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward.
{15:3} And it went out to the southern side of the Ascent of Aqrabbim, passed over to Tsin, and went up on the south side of Qaḏĕsh Barnĕa, and passed over to Ḥetsron, went up to Aḏar, and went around to Qarqa,
{15:4} and passed over to Atsmon, and went out to the wadi of Mitsrayim, and the border ended at the sea. This is your southern border.
{15:5} And the east border was the Salt Sea as far as the end of the Yardĕn. And the border on the northern quarter began at the bay of the sea at the end of the Yardĕn.
{15:6} And the border went up to Bĕyth Ḥoḡlah and passed over north of Bĕyth Araḇah. And the border went up to the stone of Bohan son of Re’uḇĕn.
{15:7} And the border went up toward Deḇir from the Valley of Aḵor, and it turned northward toward Gilgal, which is before the Ascent of Aḏummim, which is south of the wadi. And the border passed over to the waters of Ěn Shemesh and ended at Ěn Roḡĕl.
{15:8} And the border went up by the Valley of the Son of Hinnom to the southern slope of the Yeḇusite city, that is Yerushalayim. And the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the Valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the Valley of Repha’im northward.
{15:9} And the border went around from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtowaḥ, and went up to the cities of Mount Ephron. And the border went around to Ba‛alah, that is Qiryath Ye‛arim.
{15:10} And the border turned around from Ba‛alah westward to Mount Sĕ‛ir, and passed over to the side of Mount Ye‛arim on the north, that is Kesalon, and went down to Bĕyth Shemesh, and passed over to Timnah.
{15:11} And the border went out to the side of Eqron northward. And the border went around to Shikkeron, and passed over to Mount Ba‛alah, and went out to Yaḇne’ĕl. And the border ended at the sea.
{15:12} And the west border was the coastline of the Great Sea. This is the boundary of the children of Yehuḏah all around for their clans.
{15:13} And to Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh he gave a portion in the midst of the children of Yehuḏah, according to the mouth of יהוה to Yehoshua: Qiryath Arba, that is Ḥeḇron – Arba was the father of Anaq.
{15:14} And Kalĕḇ drove out the three sons of Anaq from there: Shĕshai, and Aḥiman, and Talmai, the children of Anaq.
{15:15} And he went up from there to the inhabitants of Deḇir, and the name of Deḇir formerly was Qiryath Sĕpher.
{15:16} And Kalĕḇ said, “He who strikes Qiryath Sĕpher and shall capture it, to him I shall give Aḵsah my daughter as wife.”
{15:17} And Othni’ĕl son of Qenaz, the brother of Kalĕḇ, did capture it, so he gave him Aḵsah his daughter as wife.
{15:18} And it came to be, when she came to him, that she persuaded him to ask her father for a field. And when she got off from the donkey, Kalĕḇ said to her, “What is the matter?”
{15:19} And she said, “Give me a blessing. Since you have given me land in the South, give me also fountains of water.” And he gave her the upper fountains and the lower fountains.
{15:20} This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Yehuḏah for their clans:
{15:21} And the cities at the furthest border of the tribe of the children of Yehuḏah, toward the border of Eḏom in the South, were Qaḇtse’ĕl, and Ěḏer, and Yaḡur,
{15:22} and Qinah, and Dimonah, and Aḏaḏah,
{15:23} and Qeḏesh, and Ḥatsor, and Yithnan,

{15:31} and Tsiqlaḡ, and Maḏmannah, and Sansannah,
{15:32} and Leḇa’oth, and Shilḥim, and Ayin, and Rimmon. All the cities were twenty-nine, with their villages.
{15:33} In the low country: Eshta’ol, and Tsor‛ah, and Ashnah,
{15:34} and Zanowaḥ, and Ěn Gannim, Tappuwaḥ and Ěnam,
{15:35} Yarmuth and Aḏullam, Soḵoh and Azĕqah,

{15:40} and Kabbon, and Laḥmam, and Kithlish,
{15:41} and Geḏĕroth, Bĕyth Daḡon, and Na‛amah, and Maqqĕḏah – sixteen cities with their villages.
{15:42} Liḇnah, and Ether, and Ashan,
{15:43} and Yiphtaḥ, and Ashnah, and Netsiḇ,
{15:44} and Qe‛ilah, and Aḵziḇ, and Marĕshah – nine cities with their villages.
{15:45} Eqron with its towns and its villages,
{15:46} from Eqron to the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdoḏ, with their villages.
{15:47} Ashdoḏ, its towns and its villages; Azzah, its towns and its villages; as far as the wadi of Mitsrayim and the Great Sea with its coastline.
{15:48} And in the mountain country: Shamur, and Yattir, and Soḵoh,
{15:49} and Dannah, and Qiryath Sannah, that is Deḇir,
{15:50} and Anaḇ, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,
{15:51} and Goshen, and Ḥolon, and Giloh – eleven cities with their villages.
{15:52} Araḇ, and Dumah, and Esh‛an,

{15:54} and Ḥumtah, and Qiryath Arba, that is Ḥeḇron, and Tsi‛or – nine cities with their villages.
{15:55} Ma‛on, Karmel, and Ziph, and Yutah,

{15:57} Qayin, Giḇ‛ah, and Timnah – ten cities with their villages.
{15:58} Ḥalḥul, Bĕyth Tsur, and Geḏor,
{15:59} and Ma‛arath, and Bĕyth Anoth, and Elteqon – six cities with their villages.
{15:60} Qiryath Ba‛al, that is Qiryath Ye‛arim, and Rabbah – two cities with their villages.
{15:61} In the wilderness: Bĕyth Araḇah, Middin, and Seḵaḵah,
{15:62} and Niḇshan, and the City of Salt, and Ěn Geḏi – six cities with their villages.
{15:63} As for the Yeḇusites, the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, the children of Yehuḏah were unable to drive them out, so the Yeḇusites have dwelt with the children of Yehuḏah at Yerushalayim to this day.
{16:1} And the lot for the children of Yosĕph went out from the Yardĕn, by Yeriḥo, to the waters of Yeriḥo on the east, to the wilderness going up from Yeriḥo through the mountains to Bĕyth Ěl,
{16:2} and went out from Bĕyth Ěl to Luz, and passed over to the border of the Arkites at Ataroth,
{16:3} and went down westward to the boundary of the Yaphlĕtites, as far as the boundary of Lower Bĕyth Ḥoron to Gezer, and it ended at the sea.
{16:4} Thus the children of Yosĕph, Menashsheh and Ephrayim, inherited.
{16:5} And the border of the children of Ephrayim, according to their clans, was: The border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth Addar as far as Upper Bĕyth Ḥoron.
{16:6} And the border went out toward the sea, to Miḵmethath on the north, then the border went around eastward to Ta’anath Shiloh, and passed over it on the east of Yanoḥah,
{16:7} and went down from Yanoḥah to Ataroth and Na‛arah, reached to Yeriḥo, and came out at the Yardĕn.
{16:8} From Tappuwaḥ the border went westward to the wadi Qanah, and it ended at the sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephrayim for their clans.
{16:9} And the separate cities for the children of Ephrayim were in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Menashsheh, all the cities with their villages.
{16:10} And they did not drive out the Kena‛anites who dwelt in Gezer, so the Kena‛anites dwell among the Ephrayimites to this day and have become compulsory labour.
{17:1} And the lot for the tribe of Menashsheh, for he was the first-born of Yosĕph, was: for Maḵir the first-born of Menashsheh, father of Gil‛aḏ, because he was a man of battle, therefore he had Gil‛aḏ and Bashan.
{17:2} And for the rest of the children of Menashsheh for their clans there was: for the children of Aḇi‛ezer, and for the children of Ḥĕleq, and for the children of Asri’ĕl, and for the children of Sheḵem, and for the children of Ḥĕpher, and for the children of Shemiḏa. These were the male children of Menashsheh son of Yosĕph according to their clans.
{17:3} But Tselophḥaḏ son of Ḥĕpher, son of Gil‛aḏ, son of Maḵir, son of Menashsheh, had no sons, but only daughters. And these were the names of his daughters: Maḥlah and No‛ah, Ḥoḡlah, Milkah and Tirtsah.
{17:4} And they came near before El‛azar the priest, before Yehoshua son of Nun, and before the rulers, saying, “יהוה commanded Mosheh to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” So he gave them an inheritance among their father’s brothers, according to the mouth of יהוה.
{17:5} And ten portions fell to Menashsheh, besides the land of Gil‛aḏ and Bashan, which were beyond the Yardĕn,
{17:6} because the daughters of Menashsheh received an inheritance among his sons. And the rest of Menashsheh’s sons had the land of Gil‛aḏ.
{17:7} And the border of Menashsheh was from Ashĕr to Miḵmethath, which faces Sheḵem. And the border went up to the right to the inhabitants of Ěn Tappuwaḥ.
{17:8} The land of Tappuwaḥ belonged to Menashsheh, but Tappuwaḥ on the border of Menashsheh belonged to the children of Ephrayim.
{17:9} And the border went down to the wadi Qanah, southward to the wadi. These cities of Ephrayim were in the midst of the cities of Menashsheh, but the border of Menashsheh was north of the wadi, and it ended at the sea.
{17:10} Southward it was Ephrayim’s, and northward it was Menashsheh’s, and the sea was its border, and they reached to Ashĕr on the north and to Yissasḵar on the east.
{17:11} And in Yissasḵar and in Ashĕr, Menashsheh had Bĕyth She’an and its towns, and Yiḇle‛am and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Ěn Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Ta‛anaḵ and its towns, and the inhabitants of Meḡiddo and its towns – three of the heights.
{17:12} But the children of Menashsheh were unable to drive out the inhabitants of those cities, for the Kena‛anites desired to dwell in that land.
{17:13} And it came to be, when the children of Yisra’ĕl grew strong, that they put the Kena‛anites to compulsory labour, but did not utterly drive them out.
{17:14} And the children of Yosĕph spoke to Yehoshua, saying, “Why have you given us but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing we are a great people whom יהוה has blessed until now?”
{17:15} And Yehoshua said to them, “If you are a great people, go up to the forest and clear a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and the Repha’ites, since the hill country of Ephrayim is too narrow for you.”
{17:16} Then the children of Yosĕph said, “The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Kena‛anites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are of Bĕyth She’an and its towns and those who are of the Valley of Yizre‛ĕl.”
{17:17} And Yehoshua spoke to the house of Yosĕph, to Ephrayim and to Menashsheh, saying, “You are a great people and have great power, you are not to have one lot,
{17:18} for the hill country shall be yours. For though it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and its farthest limits shall be yours. For you are to drive out the Kena‛anites, though they have iron chariots and are strong.”
{18:1} And all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl assembled at Shiloh, and they let the Tent of Appointment dwell there. And the land was subdued before them.
{18:2} And seven tribes were left among the children of Yisra’ĕl who had not yet shared their inheritance.
{18:3} So Yehoshua said to the children of Yisra’ĕl, “Till when are you going to fail to go in and possess the land which יהוה Elohim of your fathers has given you?
{18:4} “Appoint three men from each tribe, and let me send them out to go through the land and describe it according to their inheritance, and come back to me.
{18:5} “And they shall divide it into seven portions – Yehuḏah stays within their border on the south, and the house of Yosĕph stays within their border on the north –
{18:6} and you shall describe the land in seven portions, and shall bring it to me. Then I shall cast lots for you here before יהוה our Elohim.
{18:7} “But the Lĕwites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of יהוה is their inheritance. And Gaḏ, and Re’uḇĕn, and half the tribe of Menashsheh have received their inheritance beyond the Yardĕn on the east, which Mosheh the servant of יהוה gave them.”
{18:8} So the men rose up and went. And Yehoshua commanded those who went to describe the land, saying, “Go, walk through the land, and describe it, and come back to me, and let me cast lots for you here before יהוה in Shiloh.”
{18:9} So the men went, and passed through the land, and described it in a book in seven portions by cities. And they came to Yehoshua at the camp in Shiloh.
{18:10} And Yehoshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before יהוה, and there Yehoshua divided the land to the children of Yisra’ĕl according to their portions.
{18:11} And the lot of the tribe of the children of Binyamin came up for their clans, and the border of their lot came out between the children of Yehuḏah and the children of Yosĕph.
{18:12} And their border was on the north side from the Yardĕn, and the border went up to the side of Yeriḥo on the north, and went up through the mountains westward, and ended at the Wilderness of Bĕyth Awen.
{18:13} And the border went over from there toward Luz, to the side of Luz, that is Bĕyth Ěl, southward. And the border went down to Ataroth Aḏar, by the hill that lies on the south side of Lower Bĕyth Ḥoron.
{18:14} And the border was drawn and went around the west side to the south, from the hill that faces Bĕyth Ḥoron southward, and it ended at Qiryath Ba‛al, that is Qiryath Ye‛arim, a city of the children of Yehuḏah. This was the west side.
{18:15} And the south side was from the end of Qiryath Ye‛arim, and the border went out westward, and went out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtowaḥ.
{18:16} And the border came down to the end of the mountain that faces the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, which is in the Valley of the Repha’im on the north, and went down to the Valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Yeḇusite city on the south, and went down to Ěn Roḡĕl.
{18:17} And it was drawn from the north, went out to Ěn Shemesh, and went out toward Geliloth, which is opposite the Ascent of Aḏummim, and went down to the stone of Bohan son of Re’uḇĕn,
{18:18} and passed over to the side opposite Araḇah northward, and went down to Araḇah.
{18:19} And the border passed over to the side of Bĕyth Ḥoḡlah northward, and the border ended at the north bay at the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Yardĕn. This was the southern boundary,
{18:20} and the Yardĕn borders it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Binyamin, according to its boundaries all around, for their clans.
{18:21} And the cities for the tribe of the children of Binyamin, for their clans, were Yeriḥo, and Bĕyth Ḥoḡlah, and Ěmeq Qetsits,
{18:22} and Bĕyth Araḇah, and Tsemarayim, and Bĕyth Ěl,
{18:23} and Awwim, and Parah, and Ophrah,
{18:24} and Kephar Ha‛ammoni, and Ophni, and Gaḇa – twelve cities with their villages.
{18:25} Giḇ‛on, and Ramah, and Be’ĕroth,
{18:26} and Mitspeh, and Kephirah, and Motsah,
{18:27} and Reqem, and Yirpe’ĕl, and Taralah,
{18:28} and Tsela, Eleph, and the Yeḇusite, that is Yerushalayim, Giḇ‛ath, and Qiryath – fourteen cities with their villages. This was the inheritance of the children of Binyamin for their clans.
{19:1} And the second lot came out for Shim‛on, for the tribe of the children of Shim‛on for their clans. And their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Yehuḏah.
{19:2} And they had in their inheritance Be’ĕrsheḇa, or Sheḇa, and Molaḏah,
{19:3} and Ḥatsar Shu‛al, and Balah, and Etsem,
{19:4} and Eltolaḏ, and Bethul, and Ḥormah,
{19:5} and Tsiqlaḡ, and Bĕyth Markaḇoth, and Ḥatsar Susah,
{19:6} and Bĕyth Leḇa’oth, and Sharuḥen – thirteen cities and their villages.
{19:7} Ayin, Rimmon, and Ether, and Ashan – four cities and their villages;
{19:8} and all the villages that were all around these cities as far as Ba‛alath Be’ĕr, Ramath Neḡeḇ. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Shim‛on for their clans.
{19:9} The inheritance of the children of Shim‛on was out of the portion of the children of Yehuḏah, for the portion of the children of Yehuḏah was too much for them. So the children of Shim‛on had their inheritance within their inheritance.
{19:10} And the third lot came up for the children of Zeḇulun for their clans, and the border of their inheritance was as far as Sariḏ.
{19:11} And their border went toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth, and reached to the wadi that faced Yoqne‛am,
{19:12} and turned back from Sariḏ eastward toward the sunrise, to the border of Kisloth Taḇor, and went out toward Daḇerath, and went up to Yaphiya.
{19:13} And from there it passed over eastward, to the east of Gath Ḥĕpher, toward Eth Qatsin, and went out to Rimmon, which borders on Nĕ‛ah.
{19:14} And the border went around it on the north side of Ḥannathon, and it ended in the Valley of Yiphthaḥ Ěl;
{19:15} also Qattath, and Nahalal, and Shimron, and Yiḏalah, and Bĕyth Leḥem – twelve cities with their villages.
{19:16} This was the inheritance of the children of Zeḇulun for their clans, these cities with their villages.

{19:18} And their border was toward Yizre‛ĕl, and Kesulloth, and Shunĕm,

{19:22} And the border reached to Taḇor, and Shaḥatsimah, and Bĕyth Shemesh, and their border ended at the Yardĕn – sixteen cities with their villages.
{19:23} This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Yissasḵar for their clans, the cities and their villages.
{19:24} And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Ashĕr for their clans.
{19:25} And their border was Ḥelqath, and Ḥali, and Beten, and Aḵshaph,
{19:26} and Allammeleḵ, and Amaḏ, and Mish’al. And it reached to Mount Karmel westward, and to Brook Shiḥor Liḇnath,
{19:27} and turned toward the sunrise, to Bĕyth Daḡon, and reached to Zeḇulun and to the Valley of Yiphthaḥ Ěl, then northward beyond Bĕyth Ěmeq and Ne‛i’ĕl, and went out to Kaḇul which was on the left,
{19:28} and Ḥeḇron, and Reḥoḇ, and Ḥammon, and Qanah, as far as Great Tsiḏon.
{19:29} And the border turned to Ramah and to the strong city Tsor, and the border turned to Ḥosah, and ended at the sea, from the coast to Aḵziḇ.
{19:30} And Ummah, and Aphĕq, and Reḥoḇ were included – twenty-two cities with their villages.
{19:31} This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ashĕr for their clans, these cities with their villages.
{19:32} The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, for the children of Naphtali for their clans.
{19:33} And their border was from Ḥeleph, from the terebinth tree in Tsa’anannim, and Aḏami Neqeḇ, and Yaḇne’ĕl, as far as Laqqum, and it ended at the Yardĕn.
{19:34} And the border turned westward to Aznoth Taḇor, and went out from there toward Ḥuqqoq, and reached to Zeḇulun on the south side and Ashĕr on the west side, and ended at Yehuḏah by the Yardĕn toward the sunrise.
{19:35} And the cities of defence were Tsiddim, Tsĕr, and Ḥammath, Raqqath, and Kinnereth,
{19:36} and Aḏamah, and Ramah, and Ḥatsor,
{19:37} and Qeḏesh, and Eḏre‛i, and Ěn Ḥatsor,
{19:38} and Yiron, and Miḡdal Ěl, Ḥorĕm, and Bĕyth Anath, and Bĕyth Shemesh – nineteen cities with their villages.
{19:39} This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali for their clans, the cities with their villages.
{19:40} The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan for their clans.
{19:41} And the border of their inheritance was Tsor‛ah, and Eshta’ol, and Ir Shemesh,
{19:42} and Sha‛alabbin, and Ayalon, and Yithlah,
{19:43} and Ělon, and Timnathah, and Eqron,
{19:44} and Elteqĕh, and Gibbethon, and Ba‛alath,
{19:45} and Yehuḏ, and Benĕi Beraq, and Gath Rimmon,
{19:46} and Mĕy Yarqon, and Raqqon, with the border before Yapho.
{19:47} And the border of the children of Dan went out from them. And the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem and captured it. And they struck it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt in it, and called it Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.
{19:48} This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan for their clans, these cities with their villages.
{19:49} And when they had ended dividing the land as an inheritance according to their borders, the children of Yisra’ĕl gave an inheritance to Yehoshua son of Nun in their midst.
{19:50} According to the mouth of יהוה they gave him the city which he asked for, Timnath Seraḥ in the mountains of Ephrayim. And he built the city and dwelt in it.
{19:51} These were the inheritances which El‛azar the priest, and Yehoshua son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl divided as an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before יהוה, at the door of the Tent of Appointment. And they ended dividing the country.
{20:1} And יהוה spoke to Yehoshua, saying,
{20:2} “Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl, saying, ‘Appoint for yourselves cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Mosheh,
{20:3} for the man-slayer who strikes any being mistakenly, unknowingly, to flee there. And they shall be your refuge from the revenger of blood.
{20:4} And he shall flee to one of those cities, and stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his case in the hearing of the elders of that city. And they shall take him into the city as one of them, and give him a place, and he shall dwell among them.
{20:5} And when the revenger of blood pursues him, they do not give the man-slayer into his hand, because he struck his neighbour unknowingly, and did not hate him beforehand.
{20:6} And he shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for right-ruling, and until the death of the one who is high priest in those days. Then let the man-slayer return and come to his own city and his own house, to the city from which he fled.’”
{20:7} So they set apart Qeḏesh in Galil, in the mountains of Naphtali, and Sheḵem in the mountains of Ephrayim, and Qiryath Arba, that is Ḥeḇron, in the mountains of Yehuḏah.
{20:8} And beyond the Yardĕn, by Yeriḥo eastward, they appointed Betser in the wilderness on the plain, from the tribe of Re’uḇĕn, and Ramoth in Gil‛aḏ, from the tribe of Gaḏ, and Golan in Bashan, from the tribe of Menashsheh.
{20:9} These were the cities appointed for all the children of Yisra’ĕl and for the stranger who sojourned in their midst, for anyone striking any being unknowingly, to flee there, and not die by the hand of the revenger of blood until he stood before the congregation.
{21:1} And the heads of the fathers of the Lĕwites came near to El‛azar the priest, to Yehoshua son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Yisra’ĕl.
{21:2} And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Kena‛an, saying, “יהוה commanded through Mosheh to give us cities to dwell in, with their open land for our livestock.”
{21:3} So the children of Yisra’ĕl gave to the Lĕwites from their inheritance, at the mouth of יהוה, these cities and their open land:
{21:4} And the lot came out for the clans of the Qehathites. And the children of Aharon the priest, who were of the Lĕwites, had thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Yehuḏah, from the tribe of Shim‛on, and from the tribe of Binyamin.
{21:5} And the rest of the children of Qehath had ten cities by lot from the clans of the tribe of Ephrayim, from the tribe of Dan, and from the half-tribe of Menashsheh.
{21:6} And the children of Gĕrshon had thirteen cities by lot from the clans of the tribe of Yissasḵar, from the tribe of Ashĕr, from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Menashsheh in Bashan.
{21:7} The children of Merari for their clans had twelve cities from the tribe of Re’uḇĕn, and from the tribe of Gaḏ, and from the tribe of Zeḇulun.
{21:8} Thus the children of Yisra’ĕl gave these cities with their open land by lot to the Lĕwites, as יהוה had commanded by the hand of Mosheh.
{21:9} So from the tribe of the children of Yehuḏah and from the tribe of the children of Shim‛on they gave these cities which are mentioned by name,
{21:10} and they were for the children of Aharon, one of the clans of the Qehathites, who were of the children of Lĕwi, for the lot was theirs first.
{21:11} And they gave them Qiryath Arba, that is Ḥeḇron – Arba was the father of Anaq – in the mountains of Yehuḏah, with the open land surrounding it.
{21:12} And the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Kalĕḇ son of Yephunneh as his possession.
{21:13} But to the children of Aharon the priest they gave Ḥeḇron with its open land – a city of refuge for the man-slayer – and Liḇnah with its open land,
{21:14} and Yattir with its open land, and Eshtemoa with its open land,
{21:15} and Ḥolon with its open land, and Deḇir with its open land,
{21:16} and Ayin with its open land, and Yuttah with its open land, and Bĕyth Shemesh with its open land – nine cities from those two tribes.
{21:17} And from the tribe of Binyamin, Giḇ‛on with its open land, Geḇa with its open land,
{21:18} Anathoth with its open land, and Almon with its open land – four cities.
{21:19} All the cities of the children of Aharon, the priests, were thirteen cities with their open lands.
{21:20} And the clans of the children of Qehath, the Lĕwites, the rest of the children of Qehath, even they had the cities of their lot from the tribe of Ephrayim.
{21:21} And they gave them Sheḵem with its open land in the mountains of Ephrayim as a city of refuge for the man-slayer, and Gezer with its open land,
{21:22} and Qiḇtsayim with its open land, and Bĕyth Ḥoron with its open land – four cities.
{21:23} And from the tribe of Dan, Elteqĕh with its open land, Gibbethon with its open land,
{21:24} Ayalon with its open land, and Gath Rimmon with its open land – four cities.
{21:25} And from the half-tribe of Menashsheh, Ta‛naḵ with its open land, and Gath Rimmon with its open land – two cities.
{21:26} All the ten cities with their open lands were for the rest of the clans of the children of Qehath.
{21:27} And to the children of Gĕrshon, of the clans of the Lĕwites, from the other half-tribe of Menashsheh, they gave Golan in Bashan with its open land as a city of refuge for the man-slayer, and Be‛eshterah with its open land – two cities.
{21:28} And from the tribe of Yissasḵar, Qishyon with its open land, Daḇerath with its open land,
{21:29} Yarmuth with its open land, and Ěn Gannim with its open land – four cities.
{21:30} And from the tribe of Ashĕr, Mish’al with its open land, Aḇdon with its open land,
{21:31} Ḥelqath with its open land, and Reḥoḇ with its open land – four cities.
{21:32} And from the tribe of Naphtali, Qeḏesh in Galil with its open land as a city of refuge for the man-slayer, and Ḥammoth Dor with its open land, and Qartan with its open land – three cities.
{21:33} All the cities of the Gĕrshonites for their clans were thirteen cities with their open land.
{21:34} And to the clans of the children of Merari, the rest of the Lĕwites, from the tribe of Zeḇulun, Yoqne‛am with its open land, Qartah with its open land,
{21:35} Dimnah with its open land, Nahalal with its open land – four cities.
{21:36} And from the tribe of Re’uḇĕn, Betser with its open land, Yahtsah with its open land,
{21:37} Qeḏĕmoth with its open land, and Mĕpha‛ath with its open land – four cities.
{21:38} And from the tribe of Gaḏ, Ramoth in Gil‛aḏ with its open land as a city of refuge for the man-slayer, and Maḥanayim with its open land,
{21:39} Ḥeshbon with its open land, Ya‛zĕr with its open land – four cities in all.
{21:40} All the cities for the children of Merari for their clans, the rest of the clans of the Lĕwites, were by their lot twelve cities.
{21:41} All the cities of the Lĕwites within the possession of the children of Yisra’ĕl were forty-eight cities with their open lands.
{21:42} Each of these cities had its open land surrounding it. So it was with all these cities.
{21:43} Thus יהוה gave to Yisra’ĕl all the land of which He had sworn to give to their fathers, and they took possession of it, and dwelt in it.
{21:44} And יהוה gave them rest all around, according to all that He had sworn to their fathers. And not a man of all their enemies stood against them, יהוה gave all their enemies into their hand.
{21:45} Not a word failed of any good word which יהוה had spoken to the house of Yisra’ĕl – all came in.
{22:1} Then Yehoshua called for the Re’uḇĕnites, and the Gaḏites, and half the tribe of Menashsheh,
{22:2} and said to them, “You, you have guarded all that Mosheh the servant of יהוה commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you.
{22:3} “You have not left your brothers these many days, up to this day, but have guarded the Charge, the command of יהוה your Elohim.
{22:4} “And now יהוה your Elohim has given rest to your brothers, as He promised them. So now, return and go to your tents and to the land of your possession, which Mosheh the servant of יהוה gave you beyond the Yardĕn.
{22:5} “Only, diligently guard to do the command and the Torah which Mosheh the servant of יהוה commanded you, to love יהוה your Elohim, and to walk in all His ways, and to guard His commands, and to cling to Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your being.”
{22:6} And Yehoshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.
{22:7} And to half the tribe of Menashsheh Mosheh had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half of it Yehoshua gave land among their brothers beyond the Yardĕn, westward. So when Yehoshua sent them away to their tents, he also blessed them,
{22:8} and spoke to them, saying, “Return to your tents with great riches, and with very much livestock, and with silver, and with gold, and with bronze, and with iron, and with countless garments. Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.”
{22:9} And the children of Re’uḇĕn, and the children of Gaḏ, and half the tribe of Menashsheh returned, and left the children of Yisra’ĕl at Shiloh, which is in the land of Kena‛an, to go to the land of Gil‛aḏ, to the land of their possession, which they possessed according to the mouth of יהוה by the hand of Mosheh.
{22:10} And they came to the districts of the Yardĕn which is in the land of Kena‛an, and the children of Re’uḇĕn, and the children of Gaḏ, and half the tribe of Menashsheh built a slaughter-place there by the Yardĕn, a great conspicuous slaughter-place.
{22:11} And the children of Yisra’ĕl heard it said, “See, the children of Re’uḇĕn, and the children of Gaḏ, and half the tribe of Menashsheh have built a slaughter-place opposite the land of Kena‛an, in the districts of the Yardĕn, at the border of the children of Yisra’ĕl.”
{22:12} And when the children of Yisra’ĕl heard, all the congregation of the children of Yisra’ĕl assembled at Shiloh to go to fight against them.
{22:13} So the children of Yisra’ĕl sent Pineḥas son of El‛azar the priest to the children of Re’uḇĕn, and to the children of Gaḏ, and to half the tribe of Menashsheh, into the land of Gil‛aḏ,
{22:14} and ten rulers with him, one ruler each from the chief house of every tribe of Yisra’ĕl. And each one was the head of the house of his father among the divisions of Yisra’ĕl.
{22:15} And they came to the children of Re’uḇĕn and to the children of Gaḏ, and to half the tribe of Menashsheh, to the land of Gil‛aḏ, and spoke with them, saying,
{22:16} “Thus says all the congregation of יהוה, ‘What is this trespass you have committed against the Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, to turn away this day from following יהוה, in that you have built for yourselves a slaughter-place, to rebel against יהוה this day?
{22:17} Is the crookedness of Pe‛or not enough for us, from which we have not been cleansed till this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of יהוה,
{22:18} that you turn away today from following יהוה? And it shall be, if you rebel today against יהוה, that tomorrow He is wroth with all the congregation of Yisra’ĕl.
{22:19} And indeed, if the land of your possession is unclean, then pass over to the land of the possession of יהוה, where the Dwelling Place of יהוה dwells, and take possession among us. But do not rebel against יהוה, nor rebel against us, by building yourselves a slaughter-place besides the slaughter-place of יהוה our Elohim.
{22:20} Did not Aḵan son of Zeraḥ commit a trespass in that which is under the ban, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Yisra’ĕl? And he was not the only one to die in his crookedness.’”
{22:21} Then the children of Re’uḇĕn, and the children of Gaḏ, and half the tribe of Menashsheh answered and said to the heads of the divisions of Yisra’ĕl,
{22:22} "Ěl Elohim יהוה, Ěl Elohim יהוה, He knows, and let Yisra’ĕl itself know. If this has been in rebellion, or if in trespass against יהוה, do not save us this day.
{22:23} “If we have built ourselves a slaughter-place to turn from following יהוה, or if to offer ascending offerings or grain offerings on it, or if to make slaughterings of peace offerings on it, let יהוה Himself require it.
{22:24} “But truly, from fear, for a reason we did this, saying, ‘In time to come your sons might speak to our sons, saying, “What have you to do with יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl?
{22:25} “For יהוה has made the Yardĕn a border between you and us, you children of Re’uḇĕn and children of Gaḏ. You have no portion with יהוה.” So your sons would make our sons stop fearing יהוה.’
{22:26} “So we said, ‘Let us now prepare to build ourselves a slaughter-place, not for ascending offering nor for slaughtering,
{22:27} but to be a witness between you and us and our generations after us, to do the service of יהוה before Him with our ascending offerings, with our slaughterings, and with our peace offerings, that your sons should not say to our sons in time to come, “You have no portion with יהוה.”’
{22:28} “So we said that it shall be, when they say this to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, ‘See the pattern of the slaughter-place of יהוה which our fathers made, though not for ascending offerings nor for slaughterings, but it is a witness between you and us.’
{22:29} “Far be it from us to rebel against יהוה, and to turn from following יהוה this day, to build a slaughter-place for ascending offerings, for grain offerings, or for slaughterings, besides the slaughter-place of יהוה our Elohim which is before His Dwelling Place.”
{22:30} And Pineḥas the priest and the rulers of the congregation, and the heads of the thousands of Yisra’ĕl who were with him, heard the words that the children of Re’uḇĕn, and the children of Gaḏ, and the children of Menashsheh spoke, and it was good in their eyes.
{22:31} And Pineḥas son of El‛azar the priest said to the children of Re’uḇĕn, and to the children of Gaḏ, and to the children of Menashsheh, “Today we know that יהוה is in our midst, because you have not committed against יהוה this trespass. Now you have delivered the children of Yisra’ĕl out of the hand of יהוה.”
{22:32} And Pineḥas son of El‛azar the priest, and the rulers, returned from the children of Re’uḇĕn and the children of Gaḏ, from the land of Gil‛aḏ to the land of Kena‛an, to the children of Yisra’ĕl, and brought back word to them.
{22:33} So the matter was good in the eyes of the children of Yisra’ĕl, and the children of Yisra’ĕl blessed Elohim. And they spoke no more of going against to fight, to destroy the land where the children of Re’uḇĕn and Gaḏ dwelt.
{22:34} And the children of Re’uḇĕn and the children of Gaḏ called the slaughter-place, “A witness between us that יהוה is Elohim.”
{23:1} And it came to be, a long time after יהוה had given rest to Yisra’ĕl from all their enemies round about, that Yehoshua was old, advanced in years.
{23:2} And Yehoshua called for all Yisra’ĕl, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said to them, “I am old, advanced in years.
{23:3} “And you, you have seen all that יהוה your Elohim has done to all these nations because of you, for יהוה your Elohim is He who was fighting for you.
{23:4} “See, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Yardĕn, with all the nations that I have cut off, as far as the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun.
{23:5} “And יהוה your Elohim thrust them out from before you, and shall drive them out from before you, and you shall possess their land, as יהוה your Elohim has promised you.
{23:6} “And you shall be very strong to guard and to do all that is written in the Book of the Torah of Mosheh, so as not to turn aside from it right or left,
{23:7} so as not to go in among these nations, these who remain among you. And make no mention of the name of their mighty ones, nor swear by them, nor serve them nor bow down to them.
{23:8} “But cling to יהוה your Elohim, as you have done to this day.
{23:9} “For יהוה has driven out from before you great and strong nations. As for you, no one has stood against you to this day.
{23:10} “One man of you put a thousand to flight, for יהוה your Elohim is He who is fighting for you, as He has promised you.
{23:11} “And you shall diligently guard yourselves, to love יהוה your Elohim.
{23:12} “But if you do turn back at all, and cling to the remnant of these nations, these that remain among you, and intermarry with them, and go in to them and they to you,
{23:13} know for certain that יהוה your Elohim shall no longer drive these nations out from before you. And they shall be snares and traps to you, and a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land which יהוה your Elohim has given you.
{23:14} “And see, this day I am going the way of all the earth. And you know in all your hearts and in all your beings that not one word has failed of all the good words which יהוה your Elohim spoke concerning you. All of it has come to you, and not one word of them has failed.
{23:15} “And it shall be, that as every good word has come upon you which יהוה your Elohim promised you, so יהוה does bring upon you every evil word, until He has destroyed you from this good land which יהוה your Elohim has given you,
{23:16} when you transgress the covenant of יהוה your Elohim, which He commanded you, and shall go and serve other mighty ones, and bow down to them. And the displeasure of יהוה shall burn against you, and you shall perish quickly from the good land which He has given you.”
{24:1} And Yehoshua gathered all the tribes of Yisra’ĕl to Sheḵem and called for the elders of Yisra’ĕl, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers. And they presented themselves before Elohim.
{24:2} And Yehoshua said to all the people, “Thus said יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl, ‘Long ago your fathers dwelt beyond the River – Teraḥ, the father of Aḇraham and the father of Naḥor. And they served other mighty ones.
{24:3} So I took your father Aḇraham from beyond the River, and caused him to go through all the land of Kena‛an, and multiplied his offspring and gave him Yitsḥaq.
{24:4} And to Yitsḥaq I gave Ya‛aqoḇ and Ěsaw. And to Ěsaw I gave the mountains of Sĕ‛ir to possess, but Ya‛aqoḇ and his children went down to Mitsrayim.
{24:5} Then I sent Mosheh and Aharon, and plagued Mitsrayim, as I did in their midst. And afterward I brought you out.
{24:6} And I brought your fathers out of Mitsrayim, and you came to the sea. And the Mitsrians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Sea of Reeds.
{24:7} And they cried out to יהוה, and He put thick darkness between you and the Mitsrians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them. And your eyes saw what I did in Mitsrayim. And you dwelt in the wilderness a long time.
{24:8} And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt beyond the Yardĕn, and they fought with you. But I gave them into your hand, and you possessed their land, and I destroyed them from before you.
{24:9} And Balaq son of Tsippor, sovereign of Mo’aḇ, rose up and fought against Yisra’ĕl, and sent and called for Bil‛am son of Be‛or to curse you.
{24:10} But I refused to listen to Bil‛am, so he continued to bless you, and I delivered you out of his hand.
{24:11} And you passed over the Yardĕn and came to Yeriḥo. And the masters of Yeriḥo, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Kena‛anite, and the Ḥittite, and the Girgashite, and the Ḥiwwite, and the Yeḇusite fought against you. But I gave them into your hand.
{24:12} And I sent the hornet before you which drove them out from before you, also the two sovereigns of the Amorites, but not with your sword or with your bow.
{24:13} And I gave you a land for which you did not labour, and cities which you did not build. And you dwell in them, you eat of the vineyards and olive-trees which you did not plant.’
{24:14} “And now, fear יהוה, serve Him in perfection and in truth, and put away the mighty ones which your fathers served beyond the River and in Mitsrayim, and serve יהוה!
{24:15} “And if it seems evil in your eyes to serve יהוה, choose for yourselves this day whom you are going to serve, whether the mighty ones which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the mighty ones of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But I and my house, we serve יהוה.”
{24:16} And the people answered and said, “Far be it from us to forsake יהוה, to serve other mighty ones,
{24:17} for יהוה our Elohim is He who has brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Mitsrayim, from the house of bondage, who did those great signs before our eyes, and has guarded us in all the way that we went and among all the people through whom we passed.
{24:18} “And יהוה drove out from before us all the people, even the Amorites who dwelt in the land. We too serve יהוה, for He is our Elohim.”
{24:19} Then Yehoshua said to the people, “You are not able to serve יהוה, for He is a set-apart Elohim, a jealous Ěl is He. He does not bear with your transgression and with your sins,
{24:20} if you forsake יהוה and shall serve mighty ones of a stranger. Then He shall turn back and do you evil and consume you, after He has been good to you.”
{24:21} And the people said to Yehoshua, “No, but we do serve יהוה!”
{24:22} Then Yehoshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen יהוה for yourselves, to serve Him.” And they said, “Witnesses!”
{24:23} “And now, put away the mighty ones of the stranger which are in your midst, and incline your heart to יהוה Elohim of Yisra’ĕl.”
{24:24} And the people said to Yehoshua, “יהוה our Elohim we serve, and His voice we obey.”
{24:25} And Yehoshua made a covenant with the people that day, and laid on them a law and a right-ruling in Sheḵem.
{24:26} Then Yehoshua wrote these words in the Book of the Torah of Elohim. And he took a large stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the set-apart place of יהוה.
{24:27} And Yehoshua said to all the people, “See, this stone is a witness to us, for it has heard all the words of יהוה which He spoke to us. And it shall be a witness against you, lest you lie against your Elohim.”
{24:28} Then Yehoshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance.
{24:29} And after these events it came to be that Yehoshua son of Nun, the servant of יהוה, died, one hundred and ten years old.
{24:30} And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Seraḥ, which is in the mountains of Ephrayim, on the north side of Mount Ga‛ash.
{24:31} And Yisra’ĕl served יהוה all the days of Yehoshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Yehoshua, who had known all the works of יהוה which He had done for Yisra’ĕl.
{24:32} And the bones of Yosĕph, which the children of Yisra’ĕl had brought up out of Mitsrayim, they buried at Sheḵem, in the plot of ground which Ya‛aqoḇ had bought from the sons of Ḥamor the father of Sheḵem for one hundred qesitah, and which had become an inheritance of the children of Yosĕph.
{24:33} And El‛azar son of Aharon died, and they buried him in a hill that belonged to Pineḥas his son, which was given to him in the hill country of Ephrayim.
