{1:1} The Word of Jehovah that came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel.
{1:2} The beginning of the Word of Jehovah by Hosea. And Jehovah said to Hosea, Go, take to yourself a wife of prostitution, and children of prostitution. For the land has committed adultery against Jehovah with great harlotry.
{1:3} So he went and took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, who conceived and bore him a son.
{1:4} And Jehovah said to him, Call his name Jezreel, for yet in a little while I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
{1:5} And it shall be in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.
{1:6} And she conceived again and bore a daughter. And He said to him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.
{1:7} Yet I will have mercy on the house of Judah and will save them by Jehovah their God. And I will not save them by bow nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.
{1:8} And when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son.
{1:9} Then He said, Call his name Lo-ammi, for you are not My people, and I will not be your God.
{1:10} Yet the number of the sons of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered. And it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said to them, You are not My people, it shall be said to them, you are Sons of the Living God.
{1:11} And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel shall be gathered together, and shall appoint over themselves one head. And they shall go up out of the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel.
{2:1} Say to your brothers, A People; and to your sisters, Mercy.
{2:2} Strive! Contend with your mother, for she is not My wife, nor am I her husband. Therefore, let her put away her harlotries from her presence, and her adulteries from between her breasts,
{2:3} lest I strip her naked and set her out as in the day that she was born, and make her as the wilderness, and make her like a dry land, and kill her with thirst.
{2:4} And I will not have compassion on her sons, for they are the sons of harlotries.
{2:5} For their mother has prostituted herself; she who conceived them has behaved shamefully. For she said, I will go after my lovers who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.
{2:6} Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and I will close off her wall, so that she shall not find her paths.
{2:7} And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not reach to them. And she shall seek them, but shall not find them. Then she shall say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then it was better with me than now.
{2:8} For she did not know that I gave her grain and wine and oil, and I multiplied her silver and the gold which they prepared for Baal.
{2:9} Therefore I will return and take away My grain in its time, and My wine in its season. And I will take back My wool and My linen given to cover her nakedness.
{2:10} And now I will uncover her lewdness in the eyes of her lovers, and no man shall deliver her out of My hand.
{2:11} I will also put an end to all her joy, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.
{2:12} And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, of which she has said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me. And I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
{2:13} And I will visit upon her the days of the Baals in which she burned incense to them. She even adorned herself with her nose rings, and her jewels, and she went after her lovers and forgot Me, says Jehovah.
{2:14} Therefore, behold, I will seduce her and bring her into the wilderness, and speak to her heart.
{2:15} And from there I will give her vineyards to her, and the Valley of Achor for a door of hope. And she shall respond there as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
{2:16} And in that day, says Jehovah, you shall call Me, My Husband; and you shall no more call Me, My Master.
{2:17} For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth; and they shall no more be remembered by their name.
{2:18} And in that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground. And I will break the bow and the sword, and the battle out of the earth, and I will make them lie down safely.
{2:19} And I will betroth you to Me forever. Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness, and in justice, and in kindness, and in compassion.
{2:20} I will even betroth you to Me in faithfulness. And you shall know Jehovah.
{2:21} And it shall come to pass in that day that I will answer, says Jehovah. I will answer the heavens, and they shall respond to the earth.
{2:22} And the earth shall respond with grain, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Jezreel.
{2:23} And I will sow her unto Me in the earth. And I will have mercy on No Mercy. And I will say to those who were Not My People, You are My people! And they shall say, You are My God!
{3:1} And Jehovah said to me, Go again, love a woman loved by a companion, yet an adulteress, like the love of Jehovah toward the sons of Israel, who turn to other gods and love raisin cakes of grapes.
{3:2} So I bought her for myself with fifteen pieces of silver, and with a homer and a half of barley.
{3:3} And I said to her, You shall stay with me many days. You shall not be a harlot, nor be with another man, and I also will be for you.
{3:4} For the sons of Israel shall remain many days without king or ruler, and without sacrifice, and without pillars, and without ephod or teraphim.
{3:5} Afterward the sons of Israel shall return and seek Jehovah their God and David their king. And they shall fear Jehovah and His goodness in the latter days.
{4:1} Hear the Word of Jehovah, you sons of Israel, for Jehovah has a complaint against the inhabitants of the land; for there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
{4:2} Swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and the committing of adultery burst forth. And blood touches against blood.
{4:3} On account of this the land shall mourn, and every one living there shall languish, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens; yes, even the fish of the sea shall be taken away.
{4:4} Yet let no man strive with nor reprove another man. For your people are like those who strive with a priest.
{4:5} Therefore you shall stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with you at night, and I will destroy your mother.
{4:6} My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from being priest to Me. Since you have forgotten the Law of your God, I also will forget your sons.
{4:7} As they were increased, so they sinned against Me. I will change their glory into shame.
{4:8} They eat up the sin of My people, and they set their appetites on their iniquity.
{4:9} And it shall be: Like people, like priest. And I will visit their ways upon them and repay them for their deeds.
{4:10} For they shall eat and not have enough. They shall commit fornication and not bring forth, because they have ceased to take heed to Jehovah.
{4:11} Harlotry and wine and new wine snatch away the heart.
{4:12} My people seek advice from their wooden idols, and their magic wand expounds to them. For the spirit of harlotry has led them astray, and they have committed adultery against their God.
{4:13} They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinth, because their shade is good. On account of this, your daughters shall prostitute themselves, and your brides shall commit adultery.
{4:14} I will not punish your daughters when they prostitute themselves, nor your brides when they commit adultery. For the men themselves go aside with harlots, and they sacrifice with temple prostitutes. Therefore the people who do not understand will be thrust down.
{4:15} Israel, though you commit fornication, do not let Judah become guilty. And do not come to Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Jehovah lives.
{4:16} For Israel rebels like a stubborn heifer. Now Jehovah will feed them as a lamb in a large area.
{4:17} Ephraim is joined to idols. Let him alone.
{4:18} Their drink is rebellion. They are continually committing fornication. Her defenders dearly love disgrace.
{4:19} The wind binds her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
{5:1} Hear this, O priests, and pay attention, O house of Israel. And give ear, O house of the king. For judgment is toward you, because you have been a snare to Mizpah, and a net spread on Tabor.
{5:2} And revolters are deep in slaughter, though I chasten all of them.
{5:3} I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me. For now, O Ephraim, you have committed harlotry; Israel is defiled.
{5:4} They do not devote their doings to turn back to their God. For the spirit of harlotry is in their midst, and they do not know Jehovah.
{5:5} And the pride of Israel testifies to his face. Therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity. Judah shall also stumble with them.
{5:6} They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah, but they shall not find Him; He has withdrawn Himself from them.
{5:7} They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah, for they have brought forth strange sons. Now a new moon shall devour them with their heritage.
{5:8} Blow the shofar in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah. Cry aloud at Beth-aven; after you, O Benjamin.
{5:9} Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke. Among the tribes of Israel I have made known that which is sure.
{5:10} The rulers of Judah were like those who move borders; I will pour out My wrath on them like water.
{5:11} Ephraim is oppressed and crushed in judgment, because he has willingly walked, keeping back from the commandments.
{5:12} Therefore, I will be to Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
{5:13} When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to King Jareb. Yet he could not heal you, nor did he cure you of your wound.
{5:14} For I am to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah; I, even I, tear and go away; I take away, and no one rescues.
{5:15} I will go and return to My place until they confess their guilt and seek My face. In their affliction they will seek Me earnestly.
{6:1} Come, and let us return to Jehovah. For He has torn, and He will heal us. He has stricken, and He will bind us up.
{6:2} After two days He will restore us to life. In the third day He will raise us up, and we shall live in His presence.
{6:3} Then we shall know, we who follow on to know Jehovah. His going forth is established as the dawn. And He shall come to us as the rain, as the latter and former rain to the earth.
{6:4} O Ephraim, what shall I do to you? O Judah, what shall I do to you? For your goodness is like a morning cloud, and it goes away like the early dew.
{6:5} Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the Words of My mouth; and your judgments are as the light that goes forth.
{6:6} For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
{6:7} But, like Adam, they have transgressed the covenant; they have dealt treacherously against Me there.
{6:8} Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity, foot-tracked with blood.
{6:9} And as bands of robbers lie in wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way, getting an early start at it; for they plot wickedness.
{6:10} I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the harlotry of Ephraim; Israel is defiled.
{6:11} Also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed for you, when I return the captives of My people.
{7:1} When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria. For they have dealt falsely; and a thief comes; a troop of robbers plunders outside.
{7:2} And they do not consider within their hearts that I remember all their evil. Now their own doings have surrounded them. They are before My face.
{7:3} They make the king glad with their evil, and the rulers with their lies.
{7:4} They are all adulterers, like an oven heated by the baker; he ceases from stirring after kneading the dough until it is leavened.
{7:5} In the day of our king, the rulers have made themselves sick, inflamed with wine. He stretches out his hand with scorners.
{7:6} For they have prepared their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait. Their baker sleeps all night; in the morning it burns like a flaming fire.
{7:7} They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges. All their kings have fallen; not one among them calls unto Me.
{7:8} Ephraim has mixed himself among the peoples. Ephraim is a cake not turned.
{7:9} Strangers have eaten up his strength, yet he does not know it. Yea, gray hairs are sprinkled here and there on him, yet he does not know it.
{7:10} And the pride of Israel testifies to his face. And they do not return to Jehovah their God, nor seek Him for all this.
{7:11} Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart; they call to Egypt; they go to Assyria.
{7:12} When they go, I will spread My net upon them; I will bring them down like the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, according to the report their congregation heard.
{7:13} Woe to them! For they have fled from Me. Ruin to them! For they have transgressed against Me. Though I redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against Me.
{7:14} And they have not cried to Me with their heart, when they wailed on their beds. They assemble themselves for grain and wine; they turn aside from Me.
{7:15} Though I disciplined, I made their arms strong; yet they devise evil against Me.
{7:16} They return, but not to the Most High. They are like a treacherous bow. Their rulers shall fall by the sword from the rage of their tongue. This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
{8:1} Put the shofar to your mouth. He comes like an eagle against the house of Jehovah, because they have transgressed My covenant and have rebelled against My Law.
{8:2} Israel shall cry to Me, My God, we know You.
{8:3} Israel has cast off the good; the enemy shall pursue him.
{8:4} They have set up kings, but not by Me. They have made rulers, but I did not acknowledge it. They made idols for themselves with their silver and their gold, so that they may be cut off.
{8:5} O Samaria, your calf has cast you off. My anger is kindled against them. How long until they attain to innocence?
{8:6} For it was also from Israel: The craftsman made it, but it is not God. But the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
{8:7} For they sow the wind, and they reap the whirlwind. It has no stalk; the bud shall yield no flour. If it should happen to produce, strangers will swallow it up.
{8:8} Israel is swallowed up. They are now among the nations as a vessel in which is no pleasure.
{8:9} For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself. Ephraim has hired lovers.
{8:10} Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now I will gather them; and they shall begin to be few, because of the burden of the king of rulers.
{8:11} Because Ephraim has made many altars to sin, they are altars to him to sin.
{8:12} I have written the great things of My Law for him, but they were counted as a strange thing.
{8:13} They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of My offerings, and they eat; but Jehovah does not accept them. Now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins. They shall return to Egypt.
{8:14} For Israel has forgotten his Maker, and builds temples. And Judah has multiplied fortified cities. But I will send a fire on his cities, and it shall burn up his palaces.
{9:1} O Israel, do not rejoice for joy, like the peoples. For you have committed adultery against your God. You have loved for hire on every grain threshing floor.
{9:2} The threshing floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.
{9:3} They shall not live in the land of Jehovah. But Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.
{9:4} They shall not offer wine to Jehovah; they shall not be pleasing to Him. Their sacrifices shall be like the bread of sorrows to them; all who eat it shall be defiled, for their bread for their life shall not come into the house of Jehovah.
{9:5} What will you do in the appointed day, and in the day of the feast of Jehovah?
{9:6} For, lo, they are gone because of destruction. Egypt shall gather them up; Memphis shall bury them. Nettles shall possess their valuables of silver; thorns shall be in their tents.
{9:7} The days of visitation have come; the days of retribution have come. Israel shall know. The prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is insane, because of the greatness of your iniquity and your great hatred.
{9:8} The watchman of Ephraim is with my God, but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways; hatred is in the house of his God.
{9:9} They have deeply corrupted, as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity; He will punish their sins.
{9:10} I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the firstfruits on the fig tree in its first season. But they went to Baal-peor and set themselves apart to that shameful thing. And they became an abomination like that which they loved.
{9:11} The glory of Ephraim shall fly away like a bird; from birth, and from the womb, and from conception.
{9:12} Though they raise their sons, yet I will make them childless, until not a man is left. Yea, woe also to them when I turn away from them!
{9:13} As I watched Tyre, Ephraim was planted in a pleasant place. But Ephraim shall lead out his sons to the slayer.
{9:14} O Jehovah, give them. What will you give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
{9:15} All their wickedness is in Gilgal, for there I hated them. I will drive them out of My house because of the wickedness of their doings, I will love them no more; all their rulers are rebellious.
{9:16} Ephraim is stricken; their root is dried up; they shall bear no fruit. Yea, though they bear, yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb.
{9:17} My God shall cast them away because they did not give heed to Him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
{10:1} Israel empties his vine; he bears fruit for himself. According to the abundance of his fruit he has increased the altars. They have made beautiful images according to the goodness of his land.
{10:2} Their heart is divided. Now they shall be found guilty. He will break down their altars; He will destroy their images.
{10:3} For now they shall say, We have no king, because we did not fear Jehovah. What then should a king do for us?
{10:4} They have spoken words, swearing vanity in making a covenant. Thus judgment springs up like hemlock in the furrows of the field.
{10:5} The inhabitants of Samaria shall dread because of the calves of Beth-aven. For its people shall mourn over it; also its priests shall tremble over it, over its glory, because it has departed from it.
{10:6} It shall also be carried to Assyria, as a present to King Jareb. Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.
{10:7} Samaria is cut off; her king is like a twig on the water.
{10:8} Also, the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed. The thorn and the thistle shall grow up over their altars. And they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us!
{10:9} O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah. There they stood. The battle against the sons of iniquity did not overtake them in Gibeah.
{10:10} When it is My desire, I shall chasten them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they bind themselves to their two transgressions.
{10:11} And Ephraim is a trained heifer, loving to tread grain. But I passed over her fair neck; I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow; Jacob shall break clods for him.
{10:12} Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in kindness. Break up your fallow ground. For it is time to seek Jehovah, until He comes and rains righteousness on you.
{10:13} You have plowed wickedness; you have reaped iniquity. You have eaten the fruit of lies because you trusted in your own way, in the multitude of your mighty men.
{10:14} Therefore an uproar shall rise up among your people. And all your fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle. The mother was dashed in pieces upon her sons.
{10:15} Thus it shall be done to you, O Bethel, because of your great wickedness. At dawn, the king of Israel shall be completely cut off.
{11:1} When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and I called My Son out of Egypt.
{11:2} As they called to them, so they went from them. They sacrificed to the Baals, and burned incense to graven images.
{11:3} I also taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by their arms. But they did not know that I healed them.
{11:4} I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love. And I was to them as those who lift off the yoke from their jaws; and I held out food to them.
{11:5} He shall not return to the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to come back.
{11:6} And the sword shall whirl about in his cities, and shall bring to an end his isolated districts, and shall consume them, because of their own counsels.
{11:7} And My people are bent on backsliding from Me. Though they call to the Most High, no one at all exalts Him.
{11:8} How shall I give you up, Ephraim? Shall I deliver you up, Israel? How shall I make you like Admah? Shall I set you as Zeboim? My heart churns within Me; My compassions are kindled together.
{11:9} I will not execute My burning anger; I will not return to destroy Ephraim. For I am the Mighty God, and not a man, the Holy One in your midst. And I will not enter into the city with terror.
{11:10} They shall walk after Jehovah; He shall roar like a lion. When He roars, then His sons shall tremble from the west.
{11:11} They shall tremble as a bird from Egypt, and as a dove from the land of Assyria. And I will make them live in their houses, says Jehovah.
{11:12} Ephraim circles around Me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah still walks with God and is faithful with the saints.
{12:1} Ephraim feeds on wind, and follows after the east wind; all the day he multiplies lies and ruin. And they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.
{12:2} Jehovah also has a quarrel with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; He will repay him according to his deeds.
{12:3} He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he contended with God.
{12:4} Yes, he wept and pleaded with Him, and he contended with the Angel and prevailed. He found Him at Bethel, and He spoke with us there,
{12:5} even Jehovah the God of Hosts. Jehovah is His memorial.
{12:6} Therefore return to your God; keep kindness and justice, and wait for your God continually.
{12:7} He is a merchant; the scales of deceit are in his hand; he loves to oppress.
{12:8} And Ephraim said, I am rich; I have found much wealth for myself. In all my labors they shall find no iniquity in me that is sin.
{12:9} But I am Jehovah your God ever since the land of Egypt; I will again make you live in tents, as in the days of the appointed feasts.
{12:10} I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and used parables by the hand of the prophets.
{12:11} Is Gilead evil? Surely they are vanity. They sacrificed bulls in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field.
{12:12} And Jacob fled into the land of Syria, and Israel served for a wife; yea, he kept sheep for a wife.
{12:13} And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was protected.
{12:14} Ephraim has provoked Him to anger most bitterly. Therefore He shall leave the guilt of his blood upon him, and his Lord shall return his reproach unto him.
{13:1} When Ephraim spoke, trembling, he was lifted up in Israel. But when he trespassed through Baal, he died.
{13:2} And now they sin more and more, and they have made themselves molten images of their silver, idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen. They say of them, Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves.
{13:3} Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passes away, as chaff driven from the threshing floor by the storm, and as smoke out of the chimney.
{13:4} Yet I am Jehovah your God, ever since the land of Egypt; and you shall know no other gods but Me. For there is no Savior besides Me.
{13:5} I have known you in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.
{13:6} When they had pasture, they were filled. They were filled, and their heart was exalted. Therefore they have forgotten Me.
{13:7} Now I am like a lion to them; I will watch by the way like a leopard.
{13:8} I will meet them like a bereaved bear, and I will tear open the carcass to their heart; and like a lion, I will devour them there; the beasts of the field shall tear them.
{13:9} O Israel, you are destroyed, but your help is in Me.
{13:10} Where is your king now, that he may save you in all your cities? And where are your judges to whom you said, Give to me a king and rulers?
{13:11} I gave you a king in My anger, and took him away in My fury.
{13:12} The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is treasured up.
{13:13} The pangs of a woman giving birth shall come upon him; he is an unwise son, for he does not stay long where children are born.
{13:14} I will ransom them from the hand of Sheol; I will redeem them from death. O death, where are your plagues? O Sheol, where is your destruction? Sorrow is hidden from My eyes.
{13:15} Though he is fruitful among brothers, an east wind shall come. The wind of Jehovah shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall be disappointed because his fountain shall be dried up. He shall plunder the treasure of all desirable vessels.
{13:16} Samaria is held guilty, for she has rebelled against her God. They shall fall by the sword, their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped open.
{14:1} O Israel, return to Jehovah your God, for you have stumbled by your iniquity.
{14:2} Take words with you and return to Jehovah. Say to Him, Take away all iniquity and receive us with grace, that we may repay with the calves of our lips.
{14:3} Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride on horses. We shall not say any more to the work of our hands, You are our gods! For in You the fatherless finds mercy.
{14:4} I will heal their backslidings; I will love them freely; for My anger has turned away from him.
{14:5} I will be as the dew to Israel; he shall blossom as the lily and thrust forth his roots like Lebanon.
{14:6} His branches shall spread out, and his beauty shall be like the olive tree, and his scent as Lebanon.
{14:7} They who live under his shadow shall return; they shall live like the grain, and blossom like the vine; their remembrance shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
{14:8} Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard and observed him. I am as a green cypress tree; your fruit is found in Me.
{14:9} Who is wise and discerns these things? Who is discerning and knows them? For the ways of Jehovah are right, and the righteous shall walk in them; but transgressors shall stumble in them.
