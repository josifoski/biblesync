{1:1} The Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
{1:2} To know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;
{1:3} to receive instruction in wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
{1:4} to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young man.
{1:5} The wise hears and increases learning, and the one of understanding gets wise counsel,
{1:6} to understand a proverb and an enigma; the words of the wise, and their difficult sayings.
{1:7} The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
{1:8} My son, hear the instruction of your father, and do not forsake the law of your mother;
{1:9} for they shall be an ornament of grace to your head, and chains around your neck.
{1:10} My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.
{1:11} If they say, Walk with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause,
{1:12} let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those who go down into the Pit,
{1:13} we shall find all sorts of precious stuff, we shall fill our houses with plunder;
{1:14} cast in your lot among us, let us all have one purse.
{1:15} My son, do not walk in the way with them! Withhold your foot from their path;
{1:16} for their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed blood.
{1:17} Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
{1:18} And they lie in wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own souls.
{1:19} So are the ways of everyone who gets unjust gain; it takes away the soul of its master.
{1:20} Wisdom cries aloud outside; she utters her voice in the square;
{1:21} she calls out over the tumult; at the openings of the gates, in the city she utters her words:
{1:22} How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity; and those who scorn desire their scorning; and fools hate knowledge?
{1:23} Turn back at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you; I will make my words known to you.
{1:24} Because I have called, and you refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one pays attention,
{1:25} but you have ignored all my counsel, and have not desired my reproof:
{1:26} I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your terror comes;
{1:27} when your terror comes like a storm; and your devastation arrives like a tempest, when distress and anguish come upon you.
{1:28} Then they shall call upon me, and I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me.
{1:29} Because they hated knowledge and chose not the fear of Jehovah.
{1:30} They did not desire my counsel; they despised all my reproof.
{1:31} Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices.
{1:32} For the turning away of the simple kills them, and the ease of fools destroys them.
{1:33} But whoever listens to me shall live in confidence, and shall rest securely from the dread of evil.
{2:1} My son, if you will receive my words, and treasure up my commandments within you,
{2:2} so that you incline your ear to wisdom, and extend your heart to understanding;
{2:3} yes, if you cry out for discernment, lifting up your voice for understanding;
{2:4} if you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures,
{2:5} then you shall understand the fear of Jehovah, and find the knowledge of God.
{2:6} For Jehovah gives wisdom; out of His mouth come knowledge and understanding.
{2:7} He lays up sound wisdom for the upright; a shield to those who walk in integrity,
{2:8} to guard the paths of judgment; and He keeps watch over the way of His saints.
{2:9} Then you shall understand righteousness and justice and equity and every good path.
{2:10} When wisdom enters into your heart, and knowledge is pleasant to your soul,
{2:11} discretion shall keep watch over you, understanding shall guard you,
{2:12} to deliver you from the way of evil, from the man who speaks perverse things,
{2:13} those who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,
{2:14} who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perversities of the wicked,
{2:15} whose paths are crooked, who are devious in their tracks;
{2:16} to deliver you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who flatters with her words,
{2:17} who forsakes the guide of her youth and has forgotten the covenant of her God.
{2:18} For her house leads down to death, and her tracks to the spirits of the dead.
{2:19} No one going in to her returns, nor do they attain unto the ways of life.
{2:20} That you may walk in the ways of the good and keep the ways of the righteous.
{2:21} For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
{2:22} But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and those who act deceitfully shall be rooted out of it.
{3:1} My son, do not forget my law, but let your heart keep my commandments,
{3:2} for they shall add length of days and long life and peace to you.
{3:3} Let not mercy and truth forsake you; tie them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart;
{3:4} so you shall find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
{3:5} Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, and lean not unto your own understanding.
{3:6} In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.
{3:7} Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear Jehovah and depart from evil.
{3:8} It shall be healing to your navel and refreshment to your bones.
{3:9} Honor Jehovah with your substance, and with the firstfruits of all your increase,
{3:10} and your barns shall be filled with plenty, and your vats shall be bursting with new wine.
{3:11} My son, do not reject the chastening of Jehovah, and do not loathe His correction;
{3:12} for whom Jehovah loves He corrects, even as a father corrects the son with whom he is pleased.
{3:13} Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gets understanding;
{3:14} for its profit is better than the gain from silver, and its increase more than fine gold.
{3:15} She is more precious than rubies, and all the things you can desire are not to be compared with her.
{3:16} Length of days is in her right hand, riches and honor in her left hand.
{3:17} Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
{3:18} She is a tree of life to those who lay hold upon her, and happy is everyone who holds fast to her.
{3:19} Jehovah has founded the earth by wisdom; He has established the heavens by understanding;
{3:20} the depths were broken up by His knowledge, and the clouds drop down the dew.
{3:21} My son, do not let them depart from your eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion,
{3:22} and they shall be life to your soul, and grace to your neck;
{3:23} then you shall walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.
{3:24} When you lie down, you shall not be in dread; yea, you shall lie down and your sleep shall be sweet.
{3:25} Do not be afraid of sudden terror, nor of the devastation of the wicked when it comes.
{3:26} For Jehovah shall be at your side, and He shall keep your foot from being caught.
{3:27} Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.
{3:28} Do not say to your neighbor, Go and come back again, and tomorrow I will give, when you have it with you.
{3:29} Do not devise evil against your neighbor, since he dwells by you securely.
{3:30} Do not strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.
{3:31} Do not be envious of the violent man, and choose none of his ways;
{3:32} for the perverse one is an abomination to Jehovah, but His secret counsel is with the upright.
{3:33} The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked, but He blesses the abode of the just.
{3:34} Surely He scorns the scorners, but He gives grace to the lowly.
{3:35} The wise inherit honor, but the exaltation of fools is shame.
{4:1} Children, hear the instruction of a father, and pay attention to know understanding,
{4:2} for I give you good teaching; do not forsake my law.
{4:3} For I was my fatherâ€™s son, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother.
{4:4} And he taught me and said to me, Let your heart cling to my words; keep my commandments and live.
{4:5} Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.
{4:6} Do not forsake her, and she will preserve you; love her, and she will keep you.
{4:7} The first thing about wisdom is: Get wisdom. And with all your getting, get understanding.
{4:8} Exalt her, and she will lift you up; she shall bring you to honor when you embrace her.
{4:9} She shall bestow a wreath of grace upon your head; she shall give you a crown of glory.
{4:10} Oh my son, hear and receive my sayings, and the years of your life shall be many.
{4:11} I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in straight tracks;
{4:12} when you go, your steps shall not be constricted, and when you run, you shall not stumble.
{4:13} Take fast hold of instruction, do not let her go; keep her, for she is your life.
{4:14} Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not go in the way of evil.
{4:15} Avoid it, do not pass by it; turn from it and pass on.
{4:16} For they do not sleep unless they have done evil, and their sleep is taken away unless they cause someone to fall.
{4:17} For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
{4:18} But the path of the just is as the brightness of dawn, that keeps getting brighter until it is fully daytime.
{4:19} The way of the wicked is as darkness; they do not know at what they stumble.
{4:20} My son, pay attention to my sayings; extend your ear to my words;
{4:21} let them not depart from your eyes; keep them in the center of your heart;
{4:22} for they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh.
{4:23} Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.
{4:24} Turn away from you the crooked mouth, and put perverse lips far from you.
{4:25} Let your eyes look straight ahead, and let your eyelids look straight before you.
{4:26} Ponder the path of your feet, then all your ways will be established.
{4:27} Do not turn to the right hand or to the left; remove your foot from evil.
{5:1} My son, pay attention to my wisdom; extend your ear to my understanding;
{5:2} so that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge.
{5:3} For the lips of a strange woman drip honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil,
{5:4} but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a cleaver;
{5:5} her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on Sheol;
{5:6} lest you should ponder the path of life, her paths are unstable; you cannot know them.
{5:7} Therefore hear me now, O children, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.
{5:8} Remove your ways far from her, and do not come near the door of her house,
{5:9} lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel;
{5:10} that strangers not be filled with your strength, nor your labors be in the house of a foreigner,
{5:11} and you moan in the end, when your flesh and body are spent;
{5:12} and say, How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised correction;
{5:13} and I have not given heed to the voice of my teachers, nor extended my ear to those instructing me.
{5:14} I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
{5:15} Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well.
{5:16} Should your springs be dispersed abroad, like streams of water in the streets?
{5:17} Let them be only your own, and not for strangers with you.
{5:18} Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of your youth,
{5:19} as a loving deer and a graceful doe, let her breasts satisfy you at all times, and always be intoxicated in her love.
{5:20} For why, my son, will you be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a foreigner?
{5:21} For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah, and He ponders all his tracks.
{5:22} His own iniquities shall capture the wicked, and he shall be held with the cords of his sin.
{5:23} He shall die without instruction, and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
{6:1} My son, if you are surety for your friend, if you have struck your hands with a stranger,
{6:2} you are snared with the words of your mouth; you are captured with the words of your mouth.
{6:3} My son, do this then, and deliver yourself when you come into the hand of your friend: go humble yourself and entreat your friend.
{6:4} Do not give sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.
{6:5} Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
{6:6} Go to the ant, you sluggard! Consider her ways and be wise;
{6:7} who, having no commander, overseer or ruler,
{6:8} provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.
{6:9} How long will you rest, O sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep?
{6:10} A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest;
{6:11} so shall your poverty come as one walking, and your need like an armed man.
{6:12} A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth,
{6:13} winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, pointing with his fingers.
{6:14} Perversity is in his heart, he devises evil all the time, he spreads strife.
{6:15} Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly; he shall be broken in an instant without remedy.
{6:16} These six things Jehovah hates; yea, seven are an abomination to his soul:
{6:17} Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
{6:18} a heart that devises evil plans, feet hurrying to run to evil,
{6:19} a false witness who breathes lies, and he who spreads strife among brothers.
{6:20} My son, keep your fatherâ€™s commands, and do not forsake the instruction of your mother.
{6:21} Bind them perpetually to your heart; tie them around your neck.
{6:22} When you go, it shall lead you; when you sleep, it shall watch over you; and when you awake, it will speak with you.
{6:23} For the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life,
{6:24} to keep you from the evil woman, from the seductiveness of the foreign tongue.
{6:25} Do not lust after her beauty in your heart, and do not let her captivate you with her eyelids.
{6:26} For on account of a promiscuous woman, a man comes to a loaf of bread; for the manâ€™s wife hunts for the precious soul.
{6:27} Can a man take fire into his bosom and his clothes not be burned?
{6:28} Or can a man walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched?
{6:29} So is he who goes in to his neighborâ€™s wife; whoever touches her shall not be innocent.
{6:30} They do not despise a thief, if he steals to satisfy his soul when he is hungry.
{6:31} But if he is found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the wealth of his house.
{6:32} He who commits adultery with a woman lacks heart; he who does so destroys his own soul.
{6:33} Wounds and dishonor shall befall him, and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
{6:34} For jealousy is the rage of a man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
{6:35} He will not regard any bribes, nor will he yield to the giving of many gifts.
{7:1} My son, keep my words and treasure up my commandments within you.
{7:2} Keep my commandments and live, and my law as the pupil of your eye.
{7:3} Tie them upon your fingers; write them upon the tablet of your heart.
{7:4} Say to wisdom, You are my sister, and call understanding your kinsman,
{7:5} that they may keep you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who makes smooth her words.
{7:6} For I looked through my lattice, at the window of my house,
{7:7} and I saw among the simple ones, I observed among the children a young man lacking heart,
{7:8} passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
{7:9} in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle of the darkness of night.
{7:10} And behold, a woman came to meet him, with the attire of a harlot, and a heart of secrecy.
{7:11} (She is boisterous and stubborn; her feet do not settle down in her own house.
{7:12} At one moment she is outside, the next in the streets, and she lies in wait at every corner.)
{7:13} So she has seized him and kissed him; and with straight face says to him,
{7:14} Regarding my peace offerings, today I have completed my vows;
{7:15} therefore I came out to meet you, earnestly to seek your face, and I have found you.
{7:16} I have spread my bed with coverings, with striped cloths of linen from Egypt.
{7:17} I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.
{7:18} Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; let us delight ourselves with lovemaking.
{7:19} For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.
{7:20} He has taken in hand a bag of money, and will come home on the day of the full moon.
{7:21} With great persuasion she influences him; with her seductive lips she moves him.
{7:22} In an instant he goes after her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a fool goes to correction in fetters;
{7:23} till an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hastens to the snare; and does not realize that it is for his soul.
{7:24} Now then, listen to me, O sons, and pay attention to the words of my mouth:
{7:25} Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways; do not go astray in her paths.
{7:26} For many are the wounded she has caused to fall, and countless are the ones slain by her.
{7:27} Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the rooms of death.
{8:1} Does not wisdom call out? And does not understanding put forth her voice?
{8:2} She stands at the top of high places, by the wayside, where the paths meet,
{8:3} beside the gates; at the opening to the city, at the doors of entry, she cries aloud:
{8:4} I call out to you, O men, and my voice is to the sons of men.
{8:5} Understand wisdom, you simple ones; and you fools, be of an understanding heart.
{8:6} Listen, for I will speak of excellent things, and from the opening of my lips shall be right things.
{8:7} For my mouth shall utter truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
{8:8} All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; nothing crooked or perverse is in them;
{8:9} they are all plain to the one who understands; and right to those who find knowledge.
{8:10} Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge, rather than choice gold.
{8:11} For wisdom is better than jewels, and all delightful things cannot be compared to it.
{8:12} I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find out the knowledge of devices.
{8:13} The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, and the evil way, and the perverse mouth.
{8:14} Counsel and sound wisdom are mine; I am understanding; I have strength.
{8:15} By me kings reign, and judges decree justice.
{8:16} Rulers and nobles rule by me; even all the judges of the earth.
{8:17} I love those who love me, and those who seek me early find me.
{8:18} Riches and honor are with me; enduring wealth and righteousness.
{8:19} My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
{8:20} I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice;
{8:21} to cause those who love me to inherit substance, and I will fill up their treasuries.
{8:22} Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of His way; His works from antiquity.
{8:23} I was anointed from eternity, from the beginning, before the earth.
{8:24} When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no springs abounding with water.
{8:25} Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth;
{8:26} before He had made the earth and the fields, or the highest part of the dust of the world.
{8:27} When He established the heavens, I was there; when He inscribed a circle upon the face of the deep,
{8:28} when He made firm the clouds above, when He made strong the fountains of the deep,
{8:29} when He gave to the sea its limit, that the waters should not pass beyond His command; when He engraved the foundations of the earth,
{8:30} then I was at His side, like a master workman; and I was His delight day by day, being in merriment before Him at all times;
{8:31} making merry in the world, His earth; and my delight was with the sons of men.
{8:32} Now therefore listen to me, O children, for blessed are those who keep my ways.
{8:33} Hear instruction, and be wise, and do not refuse it.
{8:34} Blessed is the man who gives heed to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
{8:35} For whoever finds me finds life, and shall obtain favor from Jehovah.
{8:36} But he who sins against me does violence to his own soul; all who hate me love death.
{9:1} Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out her seven pillars;
{9:2} she has slaughtered her meat; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.
{9:3} She has sent out her maidens; she calls out from the highest places of the city:
{9:4} Whoever is simple, turn in here; and to the one lacking heart, she says to him:
{9:5} Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine that I have mixed.
{9:6} Forsake simplicity, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
{9:7} He who reproves a scorner gets shame to himself; and he who rebukes a wicked man gets himself a blemish.
{9:8} Do not reprove a scorner, lest he hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.
{9:9} Give to a wise one, and he will become wiser; teach a just one, and he will increase in learning.
{9:10} The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
{9:11} For by me your days shall be multiplied, and the years of your life shall be increased.
{9:12} If you are wise, you shall be wise for yourself, and if you scorn, you alone shall bear it.
{9:13} A foolish woman is boisterous; she is naive, and knows nothing.
{9:14} And she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
{9:15} to call out to those who pass by, who are going straight on their ways:
{9:16} Whoever is simple, let him turn in here; and to the one lacking heart, she says to him:
{9:17} Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
{9:18} But he does not know that the spirits of the dead are there; the ones she summons are in the depths of Sheol.
{10:1} The proverbs of Solomon: A wise son makes a father rejoice, but a foolish son is a grief to his mother.
{10:2} Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but righteousness delivers from death.
{10:3} Jehovah will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry, but He thrusts away the desire of the wicked.
{10:4} He who works with a slack hand becomes poor, but the hand of the diligent makes rich.
{10:5} He who gathers in summer is a prudent son; he who sleeps in harvest is a son who causes shame.
{10:6} Blessings are upon the head of the just, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
{10:7} The memory of the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rot.
{10:8} The wise in heart accepts commands, but the foolish of lips shall be thrown down.
{10:9} He who walks in integrity walks securely, but he who perverts his ways shall be found out.
{10:10} He who winks with the eye causes sorrow, but the foolish of lips shall be thrown down.
{10:11} The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
{10:12} Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all transgressions.
{10:13} Wisdom is found in the lips of him who has discernment, but a rod is for the back of him who lacks heart.
{10:14} The wise treasure up knowledge, but the mouth of the fool is near destruction.
{10:15} The rich manâ€™s wealth is his strong city; the destruction of the poor is their poverty.
{10:16} The labor of the righteous is life; the gain of the wicked is sin.
{10:17} He who heeds instruction is in the way of life, but he who forsakes reproof wanders.
{10:18} He who hides hatred with lying lips, and he who sends out a slander, is a fool.
{10:19} In the abundance of words there is no end of transgression, but he who restrains his lips is prudent.
{10:20} The tongue of the just is as choice silver; the heart of the wicked is as little.
{10:21} The lips of the righteous feed many, but fools die for lack of heart.
{10:22} The blessing of Jehovah, it makes rich, with no sorrow added.
{10:23} It is as jest to a fool to do wickedness; so is wisdom to a man of understanding.
{10:24} That which the wicked fears shall come upon him, but the desire of the righteous is granted.
{10:25} As the storm passes, so the wicked is no more; but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.
{10:26} Like vinegar to the teeth, and like smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to those who send him.
{10:27} The fear of Jehovah prolongs days, but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
{10:28} The hope of the righteous is gladness, but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.
{10:29} The way of Jehovah is a refuge to the upright, but destruction to doers of iniquity.
{10:30} The righteous shall never be moved, but the wicked shall not dwell on the earth.
{10:31} The mouth of the just bears fruit with wisdom, but the perverse tongue shall be cut off.
{10:32} The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, but the mouth of the wicked, perversities.
{11:1} A deceitful scale is an abomination to Jehovah, but a perfect weight stone is His delight.
{11:2} Pride comes, then comes shame; but with the lowly is wisdom.
{11:3} The integrity of the upright guides them, but the perversity of traitors shall destroy them.
{11:4} Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.
{11:5} The righteousness of the perfect shall make his way right, but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
{11:6} The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them, but traitors shall be taken in their lust.
{11:7} In the death of a wicked man, his expectation shall perish, and the hope of the wicked shall perish.
{11:8} The righteous is delivered from distress, and the wicked goes in instead of him.
{11:9} The hypocrite destroys his neighbor with his mouth, but the just is delivered through knowledge.
{11:10} When the righteous prosper, the city rejoices; and when the wicked perish, there is jubilation.
{11:11} A city is exalted by the blessing of the upright, but by the mouth of the wicked it is overthrown.
{11:12} One who despises his neighbor is without heart, but a man of understanding keeps quiet.
{11:13} One who goes around with slander reveals secrets, but the faithful spirit keeps the matter covered.
{11:14} In the absence of counsel the people fall, but there is safety in the abundance of counselors.
{11:15} He who is surety for a stranger will suffer, but he who hates striking of hands is secure.
{11:16} A gracious woman holds on to honor, and ruthless men hold on to riches.
{11:17} A merciful man does good to his own soul, but the cruel troubles his own flesh.
{11:18} The wicked does deceitful work, but one sowing righteousness receives honest wages.
{11:19} As righteousness leads to life, so the one pursuing evil does so to his own death.
{11:20} Those who are of a perverse heart are an abomination to Jehovah, but the perfect in their way are His delight.
{11:21} Though hand join to hand, the wicked shall not be held innocent, but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.

{21:16} The man who wanders out of the way of understanding shall rest in the assembly of the spirits of the dead.
{21:17} He who loves pleasure will be a poor man; he who loves wine and oil will not be rich.
{21:18} The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the traitor for the upright.
{21:19} It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and angry woman.
{21:20} There is desirable treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man squanders it.
{21:21} He who follows after righteousness and mercy finds life, righteousness, and honor.
{21:22} A wise man scales the city of the mighty and brings down the strength of its refuge.
{21:23} Whoever watches his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles.
{21:24} Proud, haughty scorner is his name, who acts with arrogant pride.
{21:25} The desire of the sluggard kills him, for his hands have refused to work.
{21:26} He covets greedily all day long, but the righteous gives and spares not.
{21:27} The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; how much more when he brings it with wicked intent!
{21:28} A false witness shall perish, but the man who hears speaks enduringly.
{21:29} A wicked man hardens his face, but the upright establishes his way.
{21:30} There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against Jehovah.
{21:31} The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but deliverance is from Jehovah.
{22:1} A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches; and loving favor rather than silver or gold.
{22:2} The rich and poor have this in common: Jehovah is the maker of them all.
{22:3} The prudent foresees the evil and hides himself, but the simple pass along and are punished.
{22:4} By humility and the fear of Jehovah are riches and honor and life.
{22:5} Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse; he who keeps his soul shall be far from them.
{22:6} Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.
{22:7} The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.
{22:8} He who sows iniquity shall reap vanity; and the rod of his anger shall fail.
{22:9} He who has a beneficent eye shall be blessed; for he gives of his bread to the poor.
{22:10} Cast out the scorner, and contention shall leave; yes, condemnation and shame shall cease.
{22:11} He who loves pureness of heart and has grace on his lips; the king will be his friend.
{22:12} The eyes of Jehovah have preserved knowledge, and He overthrows the words of those who deal treacherously.
{22:13} The sluggard says, There is a lion outside! I shall be killed in the streets!
{22:14} The mouth of strange women is a deep pit; those abhorred by Jehovah shall fall there.
{22:15} Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.
{22:16} He who oppresses the poor to make increase for himself, and he who gives to the rich, shall surely come to poverty.
{22:17} Extend your ear and hear the words of the wise, and apply your heart to my knowledge,
{22:18} for it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you; they shall all be fixed upon your lips,
{22:19} so that your trust may be in Jehovah; I have made known to you this day, even to you.
{22:20} Have I not written to you excellent things in counsels and knowledge,
{22:21} that I might make you know the verity of the words of truth; that you may answer words of truth to those who send to you?
{22:22} Do not rob the poor, because he is poor; nor oppress the afflicted in the gate;
{22:23} for Jehovah will plead their case, and plunder the soul of those who plunder them.
{22:24} Make no friendship with an angry man; and do not go with a man of fury,
{22:25} lest you learn his ways and get a snare to your soul.
{22:26} Be not one of those who strike hands, of those who are sureties for debts.
{22:27} If you have nothing with which to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you?
{22:28} Do not remove the ancient landmark which your fathers have set.
{22:29} Do you see a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before insignificant men.
{23:1} When you sit down to eat with a ruler, consider carefully what is before you;
{23:2} and put a knife to your throat if you are a man given to appetite.
{23:3} Do not desire his delicacies, for they are deceptive food.
{23:4} Do not overwork to be rich; cease from your own understanding.
{23:5} Will you set your eyes on that which is not? For riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away like an eagle into the heavens.
{23:6} Do not eat the bread of him who has an evil eye, nor desire his dainty foods;
{23:7} for as he thinks in his heart, so is he. Eat and drink! he says to you, but his heart is not with you.
{23:8} The morsel you have eaten, you shall vomit up, and spoil your pleasant words.
{23:9} Do not speak in the ears of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words.
{23:10} Do not remove the ancient landmarks, and do not enter into the fields of the fatherless;
{23:11} for their Redeemer is mighty; He shall plead their case against you.
{23:12} Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to the words of knowledge.
{23:13} Do not withhold correction from a lad, for if you beat him with the rod, he will not die.
{23:14} You shall beat him with the rod, and shall deliver his soul from Sheol.
{23:15} My son, if your heart is wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.
{23:16} Yea, my heart shall rejoice when your lips speak right things.
{23:17} Do not let your heart envy sinners; but be in the fear of Jehovah all the day long.
{23:18} For surely there is a hereafter, and your hope shall not be cut off.
{23:19} Hear, my son, and be wise, and guide your heart in the way.
{23:20} Do not be among those who are heavy drinkers of wine, or among gluttons for flesh;
{23:21} for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty, and slumber shall clothe a man with rags.
{23:22} Listen to your father who begot you, and do not despise your mother when she is old.
{23:23} Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.
{23:24} The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice; and he who begets a wise child shall be glad because of him.
{23:25} Your father and your mother shall be glad, and she who bore you shall rejoice.
{23:26} My son, give Me your heart, and let your eyes take pleasure in observing My ways.
{23:27} For a harlot is a deep pit, and a foreign woman is a narrow well.
{23:28} She also lies in wait as for prey, and increases treachery among men.
{23:29} Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaints? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?
{23:30} Those who linger long at the wine, those who go in search of mixed wine.
{23:31} Do not look upon the wine when it is red, when it gives off bubbles in the cup, when it swirls around smoothly.
{23:32} In the end it bites like a serpent and stings like a viper.
{23:33} Your eyes will see strange things and your heart will speak perversities.
{23:34} Yes, you shall be as one who lies down in the middle of the sea, or as one who lies upon the top of a mast, saying:
{23:35} They struck me, but I was not hurt; they beat me, but I did not feel it. When I awake, I will ask for more; to do it again.
{24:1} Do not be envious of evil men, nor desire to be with them.
{24:2} For their heart devises violence, and their lips talk of mischief.
{24:3} Through wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established;
{24:4} and by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches.
{24:5} A wise man is strong; yes, a man of knowledge increases strength.
{24:6} For by wise counsel you shall wage war; and in a multitude of counselors is safety.
{24:7} Wisdom is too lofty for a fool; he does not open his mouth in the gate.
{24:8} He who plots to do evil shall be called a master of evil plots.
{24:9} The wicked devices of foolishness is sin; and the scorner is an abomination to men.
{24:10} If you faint in the day of distress, your strength is small.
{24:11} If you refrain from delivering those being led away to death, those about to die;
{24:12} if you say, Behold, we did not know it; does not He who ponders the heart consider it? And the Keeper of your soul, does He not know it? And shall He not repay to a man according to his deeds?
{24:13} My son, eat honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb which is sweet to your taste.
{24:14} So shall the knowledge of wisdom be to your soul; when you have found it, then there shall be a reward, and your expectation shall not be cut off.
{24:15} O wicked one, do not lie in wait at the dwelling of the righteous; do not assault his resting place;
{24:16} for a just man may fall seven times, and rise up again; but the wicked shall stumble into evil.
{24:17} Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles;
{24:18} lest Jehovah see it, and it displease Him, and He turns away His wrath from him.
{24:19} Do not fret yourself because of evildoers, nor be envious of the wicked;
{24:20} for there shall not be a posterity to the evil; the lamp of the wicked shall be extinguished.
{24:21} My son, fear Jehovah and the king; and do not fellowship with those who are given to change;
{24:22} for their disaster shall rise suddenly, and who knows the ruin of them both?
{24:23} These things also are to the wise: To show partiality in judgment is not good.
{24:24} He who says to the wicked, You are righteous; the people will curse him and nations will abhor him.
{24:25} But to those who rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.
{24:26} He shall kiss the lips that return right words.
{24:27} Prepare your work outside, and make ready for yourself in the field; and afterwards build your house.
{24:28} Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, nor deceive with your lips.
{24:29} Do not say, I will do to him as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his deeds.
{24:30} I went by the field of the lazy man, and by the vineyard of the man lacking heart;
{24:31} and, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face of it, and its stone wall was broken down.
{24:32} Then I saw; I set my heart on it; I observed and received instruction.
{24:33} A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest;
{24:34} so shall your poverty come like a prowler, and your want like an armed man.
{25:1} These are also proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed.
{25:2} The glory of God is to conceal a thing; but the honor of kings is to search out a matter.
{25:3} The heavens for height, and the earth for depth, but the heart of kings is unsearchable.
{25:4} Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the refiner.
{25:5} Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
{25:6} Do not claim honor for yourself in the presence of the king, and do not stand in the place of the great;
{25:7} for it is better that it should be said to you, Come up here, than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince whom your eyes have seen.
{25:8} Do not be quick to start a quarrel, lest you know not what to do in the end of it, when your neighbor has put you to shame.
{25:9} Debate your case with your neighbor, and do not disclose the secret to another,
{25:10} lest he who hears it put you to shame, and your bad reputation never go away.
{25:11} A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver.
{25:12} As a ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover to an attentive ear.
{25:13} Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to those who send him; for he refreshes the soul of his masters.
{25:14} A man boasting himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.
{25:15} In being slow to anger a ruler is persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the bone.
{25:16} Have you found honey? Eat only as much as is enough for you, lest you be filled to excess and vomit it.
{25:17} Seldom set foot in your neighborâ€™s house, lest he be weary of you and hate you.
{25:18} A man who bears false witness against his neighbor is like a club, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
{25:19} Trust in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
{25:20} Like one who takes away a garment in cold weather, and like vinegar on soda, so is he who sings songs to a heavy heart.
{25:21} If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink;
{25:22} for you shall heap coals of fire upon his head, and Jehovah will reward you.
{25:23} The north wind wrings out rain; so does an angry face a slanderous tongue.
{25:24} It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than to share a house with a contentious woman.
{25:25} Like cold waters to a weary soul, so is good news from a distant land.
{25:26} A righteous man who totters before the wicked is like a fouled spring and a polluted well.
{25:27} It is not good to eat much honey; so, to search out oneâ€™s own glory is not glory.
{25:28} He who has no rule over his own spirit is like a broken down city without walls.
{26:1} As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honor is not befitting a fool.
{26:2} Like a flitting bird, like a flying swallow, so the curse without cause shall not alight.
{26:3} A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the foolâ€™s back.
{26:4} Do not answer a fool according to his folly, lest you also be like him.
{26:5} Answer a fool according to his folly, that he not be wise in his own eyes.
{26:6} He who sends a message by the hand of a fool cuts off his own feet and drinks violence.
{26:7} As the legs of the lame hang limp; so is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
{26:8} As he who binds a stone in a sling, so is he who gives honor to a fool.
{26:9} As a thorn goes up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
{26:10} The Great One who brings forth all things, gives the fool his hire, and the perishing his wages.
{26:11} As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool returns to his folly.
{26:12} Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
{26:13} The sluggard says, There is a lion in the way! A lion is in the streets!
{26:14} As the door turns on its hinges, so does the sluggard upon his bed.
{26:15} The sluggard hides his hand in the dish; it wearies him to bring it back to his mouth.
{26:16} The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who can answer with taste.
{26:17} He who passes by, and crosses over into a quarrel that is not his own, is like one who takes a dog by the ears.
{26:18} Like a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death;
{26:19} so is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, Was I not joking?
{26:20} Where there is no wood, the fire goes out; and where there is no talebearer, strife ceases.
{26:21} As coals to burning coals, and wood to fire, so is a contentious man to kindle strife.
{26:22} The words of a talebearer are gulped down, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
{26:23} Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a broken piece of pottery overlaid with silver dross.
{26:24} He who hates, disguises it with his lips, and lays up deceit within himself.
{26:25} When he speaks graciously, do not believe him; for there are seven abominations in his heart.
{26:26} He whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be disclosed before the assembly.
{26:27} Whoever digs a pit may fall into it; and he who rolls a stone, it may return upon him.
{26:28} A lying tongue hates those crushed by it, and a flattering mouth brings about ruin.
{27:1} Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring forth.
{27:2} Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.
{27:3} A stone is heavy, and sand is weighty; but a foolâ€™s wrath is heavier than them both.
{27:4} Wrath is cruel, and anger is overflowing; but who is able to stand before jealousy?
{27:5} Open rebuke is better than love carefully concealed.
{27:6} Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.
{27:7} The full soul tramples a honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
{27:8} As a bird that wanders from its nest, so is a man who wanders from his place.
{27:9} Ointment and perfume make the heart glad; so does the sweetness of advice from the soul of oneâ€™s friend.
{27:10} Do not forsake your own friend or your fatherâ€™s friend, nor go to your brotherâ€™s house in the day of your calamity; better is a neighbor that is near than a brother afar off.
{27:11} My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, so that I may have a word to answer him who reproaches me.
{27:12} A prudent person foresees the evil and hides himself, but the simple pass on and are punished.
{27:13} Take the garment of him who is surety for a stranger, and hold him in pledge for a foreign woman.
{27:14} He who blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
{27:15} A continual dripping on a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
{27:16} Whoever hides her hides the wind, and the ointment of his right hand calls out.
{27:17} As iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.
{27:18} Whoever keeps the fig tree shall eat its fruit; so he who waits on his master shall be honored.
{27:19} As in water face reflects face, so the heart of man reflects man.
{27:20} Sheol and Abaddon are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
{27:21} As the refining pot for silver and the furnace for gold, so is the mouth for a manâ€™s praise.
{27:22} Though you pound a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with the grain, his foolishness will not depart from him.
{27:23} Know and recognize the face of your flocks; set your heart on your herds.
{27:24} For riches are not forever; nor the crown from generation to generation.
{27:25} When the hay is removed, and the tender grass is visible, and mountain herbs are gathered,
{27:26} the lambs are for your clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.
{27:27} And you shall have enough goatsâ€™ milk for your food, for the food of your household, and the sustenance of your maidens.
{28:1} The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion.
{28:2} Because of the transgression of a land, many are its rulers; but a reign is prolonged by a man of discernment and knowledge.
{28:3} A poor man who oppresses the lowly is like a sweeping rain which leaves no food.
{28:4} Those who forsake the Law praise the wicked, but those who keep the Law strive against them.
{28:5} Evil men do not understand justice; but those who seek Jehovah understand all things.
{28:6} Better is the poor who walks in his integrity than he who is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.
{28:7} Whoever keeps the Law is an understanding son, but a companion of gluttons shames his father.
{28:8} He who increases his wealth by interest and usury, gathers it for him who will pity the poor.
{28:9} He who turns away his ear from hearing the Law, even his prayer is an abomination.
{28:10} Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, he himself shall fall into his own pit; but the one who is perfect shall possess the good.
{28:11} The rich man is wise in his own eyes; but the poor who has understanding searches him out.
{28:12} When the righteous rejoice, there is great glory; but when the wicked arise, men hide themselves.
{28:13} He who covers his sins shall not prosper; but he who confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy.
{28:14} Blessed is the man who is continually in awe, but he who hardens his heart shall fall into evil.
{28:15} Like a roaring lion and a ranging bear, so is a wicked ruler over the lowly people.
{28:16} A ruler lacking understanding is abundant in extortions; he who hates unjust gain shall prolong his days.
{28:17} A man who is oppressed with the blood of a soul shall flee to the pit; let no one support him.
{28:18} Whoever walks in integrity shall be delivered; but he who is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.
{28:19} He who tills his land shall have plenty of bread, but he who pursues vanities shall have poverty enough.
{28:20} A faithful man shall abound with blessings, but he who makes haste to be rich shall not be found innocent.
{28:21} To show partiality is not good; because, for a piece of bread a man will transgress.
{28:22} He who hastens to be rich has an evil eye, and does not recognize that poverty will come upon him.
{28:23} He who rebukes a man shall afterwards find more favor than he who flatters with the tongue.
{28:24} He who robs his father or his mother and says, It is no transgression, is a companion to a man who destroys.
{28:25} He who is of a proud soul stirs up strife; but he who puts his trust in Jehovah shall be made fat.
{28:26} He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, but whoever walks wisely shall be delivered.
{28:27} He who gives to the poor shall not lack, but he who hides his eyes shall have many a curse.
{28:28} When the wicked arise, men hide themselves; but when they perish, the righteous increase.
{29:1} A man who hardens his neck when reproved shall be suddenly broken, and there will be no healing.
{29:2} When the righteous multiply, the people rejoice; but when the wicked rule, the people groan.
{29:3} Whoever loves wisdom causes his father to rejoice; but a companion of harlots wastes wealth.
{29:4} The king establishes the land by justice; but he who receives bribes tears it down.
{29:5} A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.
{29:6} In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare; but the righteous shouts and rejoices.
{29:7} The righteous considers the plea of the poor, but the wicked has no discernment to know it.
{29:8} Scornful men blast and inflame a city, but the wise turn away anger.
{29:9} If a wise man contends with a foolish man, whether he rages or laughs, there is no rest.
{29:10} Men of blood hate the perfect; but the upright seek the security of his soul.
{29:11} A fool vents all his emotions; but a wise one keeps still until afterwards.
{29:12} If a ruler pays attention to lies, all his servants are wicked.
{29:13} The poor and the oppressor have this in common; Jehovah gives light to the eyes of both.
{29:14} A king who judges the lowly in truth, his throne shall be established continually.
{29:15} The rod and rebuke give wisdom, but a lad set loose brings shame to his mother.
{29:16} When the wicked become numerous, transgression increases; but the righteous shall see their fall.
{29:17} Correct your son, and he will give you rest; yea, he shall give delight to your soul.
{29:18} Where there is no vision, the people are unrestrained; but he who keeps the Law is blessed.
{29:19} A servant will not be corrected by words, for though he understands, he will not respond.
{29:20} Do you see a man hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
{29:21} He who pampers his servant from youth, that one in the end shall be as his progeny.
{29:22} An angry man stirs up strife, and a furious man abounds in transgression.
{29:23} A manâ€™s pride shall bring him low; but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit.
{29:24} He who shares with a thief hates his own soul; he hears the oath, but does not confess.
{29:25} The fear of man brings a snare, but whoever puts his trust in Jehovah shall be exalted.
{29:26} Many seek the rulerâ€™s favor, but manâ€™s justice comes from Jehovah.
{29:27} An unjust man is an abomination to the just; and he who is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.
{30:1} The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the burden. The man spoke to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:
{30:2} Surely I am more stupid than any man, and do not have the understanding of a man.
{30:3} I have not learned wisdom, nor the knowledge of the Holy One.
{30:4} Who has gone up into Heaven, or descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name, and what is His Sonâ€™s name? Surely you know.
{30:5} Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him.
{30:6} Do not add to His Words, that He not judge you and you be found a liar.
{30:7} Two things I have asked of You (Do not withhold them before I die):
{30:8} Remove far from me vanity and lying words; give me neither poverty or riches, provide for me my prescribed portion of food;
{30:9} lest I be full and deny You and say, Who is Jehovah? Or lest I be poor and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.
{30:10} Do not accuse a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you be found guilty.
{30:11} There is a generation that curses their father, and does not bless their mother.
{30:12} There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes, and yet is not washed from its excrement.
{30:13} There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! And their eyelids are lifted up.
{30:14} There is a generation whose teeth are like swords, and their jaw teeth like knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
{30:15} The leech has two daughters, crying, Give, give! Three things are never satisfied, yea, four things never say, Enough!
{30:16} Sheol, and the barren womb, the earth that is not satisfied with water, and the fire; these have not said, Enough!
{30:17} The eye that mocks his father and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.
{30:18} Three things are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I do not know:
{30:19} The way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship in the middle of the sea, and the way of a man with a virgin.
{30:20} This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats, and wipes her mouth, and says, I have done no wickedness.
{30:21} Under three things the earth quakes, and under four it is not able to bear up:
{30:22} For a servant when he reigns, a fool when he is filled with food,
{30:23} a hateful woman when she is married, and a maidservant that is heir to her mistress.
{30:24} Four things are little on the earth, but they are exceedingly wise:
{30:25} The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their food in the summer;
{30:26} the hyrax are not a mighty people, yet they make their dwellings in the crags;
{30:27} the locusts have no king, yet all of them go forth in swarms;
{30:28} you can catch a lizard with the hands, yet it is in kingâ€™s palaces.
{30:29} There are three things that are beautiful in their stride, yea, four that go right along:
{30:30} The lion is mighty among beasts and does not turn back from the face of anything;
{30:31} one girded in the loins; and a he goat; and a king with his army.
{30:32} If you have done foolishly in exalting yourself, or if you have devised evil, lay your hand over your mouth.
{30:33} Surely the churning of milk yields butter, and the squeezing of the nose brings forth blood; so the wringing of wrath brings forth strife.
{31:1} The words of King Lemuel, the burden which his mother taught him:
{31:2} What, my son? And what, the son of my womb? And what, the son of my vows?
{31:3} Do not give your strength to women, nor your ways to that which destroys kings.
{31:4} It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, nor for princes strong drink;
{31:5} lest they drink, and forget the Law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
{31:6} Give strong drink to him who is about to die, and wine to one who is of a heavy soul.
{31:7} Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
{31:8} Open your mouth for the mute, for the judgment of all those sentenced to destruction.
{31:9} Open your mouth, judge righteously, and plead the case of the poor and needy.
{31:10} Who can find a woman of strength? For her value is far above rubies.
{31:11} The heart of her husband trusts safely in her, so that he shall have no lack of gain.
{31:12} She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
{31:13} She seeks wool and flax, and works willingly with her hands.
{31:14} She is like the merchant ships; she brings her food from afar.
{31:15} She also rises while it is still night, and prepares food for her household, and portions for her maidservants.
{31:16} She considers a field and buys it; from the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
{31:17} She girds her loins with strength, and makes her arms strong.
{31:18} She tastes that her merchandise is good; her lamp does not go out by night.
{31:19} She reaches her hands to the distaff, and her hand holds the spindle.
{31:20} She extends her hand to the poor; yea, she reaches out her hands to the needy.
{31:21} She is not afraid of the snow for her household, for all her household are clothed with scarlet.
{31:22} She makes tapestry for herself; her clothing is fine linen and purple.
{31:23} Her husband is known in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.
{31:24} She makes fine linen and sells it, and delivers clothing to the merchants.
{31:25} Strength and honor are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.
{31:26} She opens her mouth with wisdom, and on her tongue is the law of kindness.
{31:27} She watches over the ways of her household, and does not eat the bread of idleness.
{31:28} Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:
{31:29} Many daughters have dealt with strength, but you have excelled them all.
{31:30} Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears Jehovah, she shall be praised.
{31:31} Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
