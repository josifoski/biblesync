{2:20} And Hur begot Uri, and Uri begot Bezalel.
{2:21} And afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir the father of Gilead, whom he had taken when he was sixty years old; and she bore him Segub.
{2:22} Segub begot Jair, who had twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead.
{2:23} (Geshur and Syria took from them the towns of Jair, with Kenath and its daughter-villages; sixty cities.) All these belonged to the sons of Machir the father of Gilead.

{4:24} The sons of Simeon: Nemuel, Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and Shaul,
{4:25} Shallum his son, Mibsam his son, and Mishma his son.
{4:26} The sons of Mishma: Hamuel his son, Zacchur his son, and Shimei his son.
{4:27} Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters; but his brothers did not have many children, nor did any of their families multiply like the sons of Judah.
{4:28} They dwelt at Beer-sheba, Moladah, Hazar Shual,
{4:29} Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad,
{4:30} Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag,
{4:31} Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susim, Beth Biri, and at Shaaraim. These, their cities until the reign of David.
{4:32} And their villages: Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Tochen, and Ashan; five cities;
{4:33} and all the villages that were around these cities as far as Baal; these, their dwelling places. Their genealogy:
{4:34} Meshobab, Jamlech, and Joshah the son of Amaziah;

{4:37} Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah;
{4:38} these mentioned by name were chiefs in their families, and their father’s house increased abundantly.
{4:39} And they went to the entrance of Gedor, as far as the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.
{4:40} And they found rich, good pasture, and the land was broad, quiet, and peaceful; for those from Ham lived there formerly.
{4:41} These recorded by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and they struck their tents and the Meunim who were found there, and utterly destroyed them, as it is to this day. So they dwelt in their place, because there was pasture for their flocks there.
{4:42} Now some of them, five hundred men of the sons of Simeon, went to Mount Seir, with Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi as their heads.
{4:43} And they struck the remnant of the escaped Amalekites, and dwelt there to this day.
{5:1} Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel (he was indeed the firstborn, but because he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph, the son of Israel, for the genealogy to not be reckoned according to the birthright;
{5:2} yet Judah has prevailed over his brothers, and from him is the chief ruler, although the birthright was Joseph’s);
{5:3} the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
{5:4} The sons of Joel: Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,
{5:5} Micah his son, Reaiah his son, Baal his son,
{5:6} and Beerah his son, whom Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria carried into captivity. He was chief of the Reubenites.
{5:7} And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned: the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah,
{5:8} and Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, as far as Nebo and Baal Meon.
{5:9} Eastward they settled as far as the entrance of the wilderness this side of the River Euphrates, because their cattle had multiplied in the land of Gilead.
{5:10} Now in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagrites, who fell by their hand; and they dwelt in their tents before the east of Gilead.
{5:11} And the children of Gad dwelt next to them in the land of Bashan as far as Salcah:
{5:12} Joel was the chief, Shapham the next, then Jaanai and Shaphat in Bashan,
{5:13} and their brethren of their father’s house: Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jachan, Zia, and Eber; seven.
{5:14} These were the sons of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz:
{5:15} Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, was chief of their father’s house.
{5:16} And they dwelt in Gilead, in Bashan and in its daughter-villages, and in all the common lands of Sharon within their borders.
{5:17} All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.
{5:18} The sons of Reuben, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty valiant men, men able to bear shield and sword, shooting with the bow, and trained in war, going out to war.
{5:19} They made war with the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab.
{5:20} And they were helped against them, and the Hagrites and all who were with them were delivered into their hand, for they cried out unto God in the battle; and He was entreated for them, because they had trusted in Him.
{5:21} And they took away their livestock; fifty thousand camels, two hundred and fifty thousand sheep, and two thousand donkeys; and one hundred thousand souls of men;
{5:22} for many fell down slain, because the war was of God. And they dwelt in their place until the captivity.
{5:23} Thus the children of the half-tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land. They multiplied from Bashan to Baal Hermon, Senir and Mount Hermon.
{5:24} These were the heads of their fathers’ houses: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel; mighty men of valor, famous men, and heads of their fathers’ houses.
{5:25} And they were unfaithful to the God of their fathers, and went whoring after the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them.
{5:26} So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria; and he carried the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh into captivity. He brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the River Gozan to this day.

{6:31} Now these are the ones whom David appointed over the service of song in the house of Jehovah, after the ark was in its resting place.
{6:32} They were serving with song before the dwelling place of the tent of meeting, until Solomon had built the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, and they attended to their service according to the ordinance.
{6:33} And these are the ones who attended with their sons; of the sons of the Kohathites: Heman the singer, the son of Joel, the son of Samuel,

{6:48} And their brethren, the Levites, were appointed to all the service of the tabernacle of the house of God.
{6:49} But Aaron and his sons were offering sacrifices with smoke upon the altar of burnt offering and upon the altar of incense, all the service of the Holy of Holies, to make atonement for Israel, according to all that Moses the servant of God had commanded.

{8:40} The sons of Ulam were mighty men of valor; archers. They had many sons, and sons of sons; one hundred and fifty. These were all sons of Benjamin.
{9:1} Thus all Israel was reckoned by genealogies, and behold, they were written in the book of the kings of Israel. And Judah was carried away captive to Babylon because of their unfaithfulness.
{9:2} Now the first inhabitants who dwelt in their possessions in their cities were Israelites, priests, Levites, and the temple slaves.
{9:3} Some of the sons of Judah, the sons of Benjamin, and the sons of Ephraim and Manasseh dwelt in Jerusalem:

{9:17} The gatekeepers: Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brethren; with Shallum as chief.
{9:18} Until then they had been gatekeepers for the camps of the sons of Levi at the King’s Gate to the east.
{9:19} Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, from his father’s house, the Korahites, were in charge of the work of the service, gatekeepers of the tent. Their fathers had been keepers at the entrance to the camp of Jehovah.
{9:20} Phinehas the son of Eleazar had been the ruler over them previously; and Jehovah was with him.
{9:21} Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper at the door of the tent of meeting.
{9:22} All those chosen as gatekeepers were two hundred and twelve. They were reckoned by their genealogy, in their villages. David and Samuel the seer had appointed them in their faithfulness.
{9:23} So they and their sons had charge of the gates of the house of Jehovah, the house of the tent, by watches.
{9:24} The gatekeepers were at the four sides: the east, west, north, and south.
{9:25} And their brethren in their villages had to come to them from time to time for seven days.
{9:26} In this trust were four chief gatekeepers; Levites. And they had charge over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.
{9:27} They lodged all around the house of God because theirs was the charge for opening up morning by morning.
{9:28} Some of them were over the vessels of service, for they brought them in by count and took them out by count.
{9:29} Some of them were appointed over the furnishings and over all the implements of the sanctuary, and over the fine flour and the wine and the oil and the frankincense and the spices.
{9:30} Some of the sons of the priests mixed the ointment of the spices.
{9:31} Mattithiah of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the trust over the things that were made in the pans.
{9:32} Some of their brethren of the sons of the Kohathites were to prepare the Bread in Rows Sabbath by Sabbath.
{9:33} These were the singers, heads of fathers of the Levites, who stayed in the chambers, and were free from other duties; for this was their occupation day and night.
{9:34} These heads of fathers of the Levites were heads throughout their generations; and dwelt in Jerusalem.
{9:35} Jeiel the father of Gibeon, whose wife’s name was Maacah, dwelt at Gibeon.
{9:36} His firstborn son: Abdon; then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab,
{9:37} Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth.
{9:38} And Mikloth begot Shimeam. And they dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, across from their brethren.
{9:39} Ner begot Kish, Kish begot Saul, and Saul begot Jonathan, Malchishua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal.
{9:40} The son of Jonathan was Merib-Baal, and Merib-Baal begot Micah.
{9:41} The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Tahrea;
{9:42} and Ahaz begot Jarah; Jarah begot Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begot Moza;
{9:43} Moza begot Binea, Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, and Azel his son.
{9:44} And Azel had six sons whose names were these: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan; these, the sons of Azel.
{10:1} Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
{10:2} And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons. And the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul’s sons.
{10:3} And the battle was heavy against Saul; and the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers.
{10:4} And Saul said to his armorbearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. So Saul took a sword and fell on it.
{10:5} And when his armorbearer saw that Saul had died, he also fell on his sword and died.
{10:6} Thus Saul and his three sons died, and all his house died together.
{10:7} And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they forsook their cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
{10:8} So it happened the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
{10:9} And they stripped him and took his head and his weapons, and sent throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news to their idols and among the people.
{10:10} And they put his weapons in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.
{10:11} And when all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
{10:12} all the valiant men arose and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons; and they brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
{10:13} Thus Saul died for his unfaithfulness which he had transgressed against Jehovah, because he had not kept the Word of Jehovah, and because he asked counsel to seek after a medium.
{10:14} He had not inquired after Jehovah; therefore He killed him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.
{11:1} And all Israel gathered to David at Hebron, saying, Behold we are your bone and your flesh.
{11:2} Also, in time past, even when Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them in; and Jehovah your God said to you, You shall shepherd My people Israel, and be ruler over My people Israel.
{11:3} Therefore all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before Jehovah. And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the Word of Jehovah by the hand of Samuel.
{11:4} And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus, where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
{11:5} And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You shall not come in here. Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the City of David.
{11:6} And David said, Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief commander. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and became chief.
{11:7} And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the City of David.
{11:8} And he built the city all around, from the Millo and all around. And Joab restored the rest of the city.
{11:9} And David went on, proceeding to greatness, for Jehovah of Hosts was with him.
{11:10} These were the heads of the mighty men with David, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the Word of Jehovah concerning Israel.
{11:11} This is the number of David’s mighty men: Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite, chief of the thirty; he had lifted up his spear against three hundred, killed at one time.
{11:12} After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was among the three mighty men.
{11:13} He was with David at Pasdammim. Now the Philistines had gathered there for battle, and there was a parcel of land full of barley; and the people had fled before the Philistines.
{11:14} But they took their stand in the middle of that field, recovered it, and killed the Philistines. And Jehovah saved by a great deliverance.
{11:15} And three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
{11:16} David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
{11:17} And David said longingly, Oh, that someone would give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate.
{11:18} So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem by the gate, and took it and brought it to David. But David would not drink it, but poured it out to Jehovah,
{11:19} and said, Far be it from me, O my God, to do this. Shall I drink the blood of these men with their souls? For at the risk of their lives they have brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things were done by the three mighty men.
{11:20} Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of another three. He had lifted up his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and had a name among the three.
{11:21} Of the three he was more honored than the other two; therefore he became their commander. However he did not attain to the first three.
{11:22} Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who had done many deeds. He had killed two lion-like ones of Moab. He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.
{11:23} And he killed an Egyptian, a man five cubits in stature. In the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, wrested the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.
{11:24} These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and won a name among the three mighty men.
{11:25} Behold, he was honored among the thirty, but he did not attain to the first three. And David appointed him over his guard.
{11:26} And the mighty ones of the army were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
{11:27} Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
{11:28} Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,
{11:29} Sibbechai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
{11:30} Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,
{11:31} Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
{11:32} Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
{11:33} Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
{11:34} the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,
{11:35} Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,
{11:36} Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
{11:37} Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,
{11:38} Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri,
{11:39} Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite (the armorbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah),
{11:40} Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
{11:41} Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,
{11:42} Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite (a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him),
{11:43} Hanan the son of Maachah, Joshaphat the Mithnite,
{11:44} Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
{11:45} Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,
{11:46} Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite,
{11:47} Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
{12:1} Now these were the ones who came to David at Ziklag while he was still restrained from before Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men, helping in the war,
{12:2} armed with bows, using both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows with the bow; Saul’s brethren from Benjamin.
{12:3} The chief: Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Berachah, and Jehu the Anathothite;
{12:4} Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite;
{12:5} Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite;
{12:6} Elkanah, Jisshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites;
{12:7} and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
{12:8} Some Gadites had separated over to David at the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men of war fit for battle, who could handle shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as gazelles on the mountains:
{12:9} Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
{12:10} Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
{12:11} Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
{12:12} Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
{12:13} Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbanai the eleventh.
{12:14} These were from the sons of Gad, chiefs of the army; the least was over a hundred, and the greatest was over a thousand.
{12:15} These are the ones who crossed over the Jordan in the first month, when it was overflowing all its banks; and they put to flight all those in the valleys, to the east and to the west.
{12:16} And some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah came to David at the stronghold.
{12:17} And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if to betray me to my enemies, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers see it and judge.
{12:18} And when the Spirit had clothed Amasai, chief of the thirty, he said: We are yours, O David; we are on your side, O son of Jesse. Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers. For your God helps you. So David received them, and assigned them to the chiefs among the troops.
{12:19} Some from Manasseh had fallen out to David when he was going with the Philistines to battle against Saul; but they did not help them, for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after taking counsel, saying, He may fall out to his master Saul with our heads.
{12:20} When he went to Ziklag, those of Manasseh who had fallen out to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai; heads of thousands from Manasseh.
{12:21} And they helped David against the bands of raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor, and they were commanders in the army;
{12:22} for at that time they came to David day by day to help him, until it was a great camp, like the host of God.
{12:23} These were the numbers of the divisions that were equipped for war, who had come to David at Hebron to turn over the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the mouth of Jehovah:
{12:24} of the sons of Judah bearing shield and spear, six thousand eight hundred armed for war;
{12:25} of the sons of Simeon, mighty men of valor fit for war, seven thousand one hundred;
{12:26} of the sons of Levi four thousand six hundred;
{12:27} Jehoiada, the leader of the Aaronites, and with him three thousand seven hundred;
{12:28} Zadok, a young man mighty in valor, and from his father’s house twenty-two commanders;
{12:29} of the sons of Benjamin, kindred of Saul, three thousand (for until then the greater number of them were keeping the charge of guarding the house of Saul);
{12:30} of the sons of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men throughout the house of their fathers;
{12:31} of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who had been designated by name to come and make David king;
{12:32} of the sons of Issachar who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, their chiefs were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their command;
{12:33} of Zebulun there were fifty thousand who could go out to war and set the battle in array with all implements of war, to help with undivided heart;
{12:34} of Naphtali one thousand commanders, and with them thirty-seven thousand with shield and spear;
{12:35} of the Danites who could draw up in battle formation, twenty-eight thousand six hundred;
{12:36} of Asher, those who could go out to war and draw up in battle formation, forty thousand;
{12:37} of the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, from the other side of the Jordan, one hundred and twenty thousand armed for battle with every kind of implement of war.
{12:38} All these men of war, who could keep ranks, came to Hebron with a perfect heart, to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest of Israel were of one heart to make David king.
{12:39} And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their brethren had prepared for them.
{12:40} Moreover those who were near to them, from as far away as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, were bringing food on donkeys and camels, on mules and oxen; provisions of flour and cakes of figs and cakes of raisins, wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly, for there was joy in Israel.
{13:1} And David consulted with the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.
{13:2} And David said to all the assembly of Israel, If it seems good to you, and it is of Jehovah our God, let us send out and broadcast to our brethren everywhere who are left in all the land of Israel, and to the priests and Levites who are with them in their cities and their common lands, that they may gather together to us;
{13:3} and let us bring around the ark of our God to us, for we have not inquired at it since the days of Saul.
{13:4} And all the assembly responded to do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
{13:5} So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim.
{13:6} And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, to Kirjath Jearim of Judah, to bring up from there the ark of Jehovah God, who dwells between the cherubim, where His name has been proclaimed.
{13:7} And they made the ark of God ride on a new cart from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio were leading the cart.
{13:8} And David and all Israel were making sport before God with all their might, with singing, with harps, with lutes, with tambourines, with cymbals, and with trumpets.
{13:9} And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to take hold of the ark, for the oxen had fallen.
{13:10} And the anger of Jehovah burned against Uzza, and He struck him because he had put his hand on the ark; and he died there before God.
{13:11} And David was furious because Jehovah had violently burst forth upon Uzza; therefore that place is called Perez Uzza to this day.
{13:12} And David feared God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God to me?
{13:13} So David did not take away the ark with him into the City of David, but turned it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
{13:14} And the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And Jehovah blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that he had.
{14:1} Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar timber, with masons and craftsmen, to build him a house.
{14:2} Thus David perceived that Jehovah had established him as king over Israel, for his kingdom had been exalted on high for the sake of His people Israel.
{14:3} And David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David begot more sons and daughters.
{14:4} And these are the names of his sons whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
{14:5} Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
{14:6} Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
{14:7} Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
{14:8} Now when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it and went out to face them.
{14:9} And the Philistines went and made a raid on the Valley of Rephaim.
{14:10} And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Have You delivered them into my hand? And Jehovah said to him, Go up, for I have delivered them into your hand.
{14:11} So they went up to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there. And David said, God has broken through to my enemies by my hand like a breakthrough of water. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
{14:12} And when they left their gods there, David commanded, and they were burned with fire.
{14:13} The Philistines again made a raid on the valley.
{14:14} And David again inquired of God, and God said to him, You shall not go up after them; circle around them, and come upon them in front of the balsam trees.
{14:15} And it shall be, when you hear a sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall go out to battle, for God has gone out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.
{14:16} So David did as God had commanded him, and they struck the camp of the Philistines from Gibeon as far as Gezer.
{14:17} And David’s fame went out into all the lands, for Jehovah had put the dread of him upon all the nations.
{15:1} David built houses for himself in the City of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched a tent for it.
{15:2} Then David said, No one may carry the ark of God but the Levites, for Jehovah has chosen them to carry the ark of God and to serve before Him continually.
{15:3} And David gathered all Israel together at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Jehovah to its place, which he had prepared for it.
{15:4} And David assembled the sons of Aaron and the Levites:
{15:5} of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and one hundred and twenty of his brethren;
{15:6} of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and two hundred and twenty of his brethren;
{15:7} of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and one hundred and thirty of his brethren;
{15:8} of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and two hundred of his brethren;
{15:9} of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and eighty of his brethren;
{15:10} of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and one hundred and twelve of his brethren.
{15:11} And David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab;
{15:12} and he said to them, You are the heads of the fathers of the Levites; consecrate yourselves, you and your brethren, that you may bring up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel to the place I have prepared for it.
{15:13} For because you did not do it the first time, Jehovah our God has burst out against us, because we had not inquired of Him concerning the ordinance.
{15:14} So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel.
{15:15} And the sons of the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders, by its poles, as Moses had commanded according to the Word of Jehovah.
{15:16} And David commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brethren as singers with instruments of song, lutes, harps, and resounding cymbals, to raise the voice with joy.
{15:17} So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of their brethren the sons of Merari, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
{15:18} and with them their brethren of the second rank. The gatekeepers: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel.
{15:19} The singers: Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, to sound the cymbals of bronze.
{15:20} Lutes on Alamoth: Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah.
{15:21} Directing with harps on the Sheminith: Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah.
{15:22} The songs: Chenaniah, chief of the Levites; he taught the songs because he had understanding.
{15:23} Doorkeepers for the ark: Berechiah and Elkanah.
{15:24} Sounding the trumpets before the ark of God: Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests. Doorkeepers for the ark: Obed-Edom and Jehiah.
{15:25} Thus David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the house of Obed-Edom with joy.
{15:26} And so it was, as God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
{15:27} David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the leader in uplifting singing. David also wore a linen ephod.
{15:28} Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting and with the sound of the shofar, with trumpets and with cymbals, sounding aloud with lutes and harps.
{15:29} And it happened, as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the City of David, that Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked through a window and saw King David whirling and playing; and she despised him in her heart.
{16:1} So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it. And they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
{16:2} And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.
{16:3} And he distributed to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread, a piece of meat, and a cake of raisins.
{16:4} And he appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, to commemorate, to thank, and to praise Jehovah the God of Israel:
{16:5} Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, and Obed-Edom, Jeiel with lutes and harps, Asaph with resounding cymbals,
{16:6} and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests continually with the trumpets before the ark of the covenant of God.
{16:7} On that day David first gave this psalm by the hand of Asaph and his brethren, to give thanks unto Jehovah:
{16:8} Oh, give thanks unto Jehovah. Call upon His name; make known His deeds among the peoples.
{16:9} Sing unto Him, make music unto Him; talk of all His wondrous works.
{16:10} Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.
{16:11} Seek Jehovah and His strength; seek His face continually.
{16:12} Remember His marvelous works which He has done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth,
{16:13} O seed of Israel His servant, You children of Jacob, His elect.
{16:14} He is Jehovah our God; His judgments are in all the earth.
{16:15} Remember His covenant forever, the word which He has commanded, for a thousand generations,
{16:16} the covenant which He has made with Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac,
{16:17} and established it to Jacob for a statute, to Israel for a perpetual covenant,
{16:18} saying, To you I give the land of Canaan as the allotment of your inheritance,
{16:19} when you were few in number, even very few, and were sojourning in it.
{16:20} When they went from nation to another, and from one kingdom to another people,
{16:21} He permitted no man to do them wrong; yea, He reproved kings for their sakes,
{16:22} saying, Do not touch My anointed ones, and do My prophets no evil.
{16:23} Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; proclaim His salvation from day to day.
{16:24} Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all peoples.
{16:25} For Jehovah is great and greatly to be praised; He is also to be feared above all gods.
{16:26} For all the gods of the peoples are nothing, but Jehovah has made the heavens.
{16:27} Honor and majesty are before Him; strength and gladness are in His place.
{16:28} Ascribe unto Jehovah, O families of the peoples, ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength.
{16:29} Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due His name; bring an offering, and come before Him. Oh, bow down before Jehovah in the beauty of holiness.
{16:30} Writhe before Him, all the earth. The world also is firmly established, it shall not be moved.
{16:31} Let the Heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; and let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigns.
{16:32} Let the sea roar, and all its fullness; let the fields rejoice, and all that is in them.
{16:33} Then the trees of the forest shall cry out for joy before Jehovah, for He has come to judge the earth.
{16:34} Oh, give thanks unto Jehovah, for He is good; for His mercy is eternal.
{16:35} And say, Save us, O God of our salvation; gather us together, and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks to Your holy name, to boast in Your praise.
{16:36} Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen; and praised Jehovah.
{16:37} Thus he left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to minister before the ark continually, according to the matter day by day;
{16:38} and Obed-Edom with his sixty-eight brethren: Obed-Edom the son of Jeduthun and Hosah, the gatekeepers;
{16:39} and Zadok the priest and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah at the high place that was at Gibeon,
{16:40} to offer burnt offerings unto Jehovah on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the Law of Jehovah which He had commanded Israel;
{16:41} and with them Heman and Jeduthun and the rest who were chosen, who were designated by name, to give thanks unto Jehovah, because His mercy is eternal;
{16:42} and with them Heman and Jeduthun, to sound aloud with trumpets and cymbals and the instruments of song of God; and the sons of Jeduthun were gatekeepers.
{16:43} So all the people departed, every man to his house; and David returned to bless his house.
{17:1} Now it came to pass, when David had been dwelling in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Behold now, I am dwelling in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is under curtains.
{17:2} And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.
{17:3} But it happened that night that the Word of God came to Nathan, saying,
{17:4} Go and tell My servant David, Thus says Jehovah: You shall not build Me a house to dwell in.
{17:5} For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, even to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.
{17:6} Wherever I have walked about with all Israel, have I spoken a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I had commanded to shepherd My people, saying, Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?
{17:7} Now therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: I have taken you from the sheepfold, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people Israel.
{17:8} And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies before you, and have made you a name like the name of the great ones of the earth.
{17:9} Moreover I have established a place for My people Israel, and have planted them, that they may dwell in their place and move no more, for the sons of wickedness to wear them out anymore, as previously,
{17:10} since the day that I have commanded judges to be over My people Israel. I have also subdued all your enemies. Furthermore I declare to you that Jehovah shall build you a house.
{17:11} And it shall be, when your days have been fulfilled to go to your fathers, that I will raise up your seed after you from your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
{17:12} He shall build Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.
{17:13} I will be his Father, and he shall be My son; and I will not take My mercy away from him, as I took it from him who was before you.
{17:14} And I will establish him in My house and in My kingdom forever; and his throne shall be established forever.
{17:15} According to all these words and according to all this vision, thus Nathan spoke to David.
{17:16} Then King David went in and sat before Jehovah, and he said: Who am I, O Jehovah God? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far?
{17:17} And yet this was a small thing in Your eyes, O God; and You have also spoken of Your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the manner of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.
{17:18} What more can David add to You for the honor of Your servant? For You have known Your servant.
{17:19} O Jehovah, for Your servant’s sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness, to make known all this greatness.
{17:20} O Jehovah, there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
{17:21} And what single nation on the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God has gone to redeem for Himself as a people; to make for Yourself a great name to be feared, to drive out nations before Your people whom You redeemed out of Egypt?
{17:22} For You designated Your people Israel as Your people forever; and You, Jehovah, have become their God.
{17:23} And now, O Jehovah, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, let it be established forever, and do as You have spoken.
{17:24} Let it even be established, that Your name may be magnified forever, saying, Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, God to Israel. And let the house of Your servant David be established before You.
{17:25} For You, O my God, have disclosed to Your servant’s ear that You will build him a house. Therefore Your servant has found heart to pray before You.
{17:26} And now, Jehovah, You are God, and have promised this goodness to Your servant.
{17:27} Now You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant, that it may be before You forever; for You have blessed it, O Jehovah, and it is blessed forever.
{18:1} After this it came to pass that David struck the Philistines, subdued them, and took Gath and its daughter-villages from the hand of the Philistines.
{18:2} Then he struck Moab, and the Moabites became David’s servants, bringing tribute.
{18:3} And David struck Hadadezer king of Zobah as far as Hamath, as he went to establish his hand by the River Euphrates.
{18:4} David took from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. And David also hamstrung all the chariot horses, except that he spared enough of them for one hundred chariots.
{18:5} When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David killed of the Syrians twenty-two thousand men.
{18:6} Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became David’s servants, and brought tribute. Thus Jehovah prospered David wherever he went.
{18:7} And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
{18:8} Also from Tibhath and from Chun, cities of Hadadezer, David brought very much bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, the pillars, and the articles of bronze.
{18:9} And when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
{18:10} he sent Hadoram his son to King David, to ask after his welfare and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him (for Hadadezer had been a man of war against Tou); along with all kinds of articles of gold, silver, and bronze.
{18:11} King David also consecrated these unto Jehovah, along with the silver and gold that he had brought from all these nations: Edom, Moab, the children of Ammon, the Philistines, and Amalek.
{18:12} Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
{18:13} He also put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s servants. And Jehovah prospered David wherever he went.
{18:14} Thus David reigned over all Israel, executing judgment and justice to all his people.
{18:15} Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
{18:16} Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests; Shavsha was the scribe;
{18:17} Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chiefs at the king’s side.
{19:1} It happened after this that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place.
{19:2} And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came to Hanun in the land of the children of Ammon to comfort him.
{19:3} And the leaders of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, In your eyes is David honoring your father in that he has sent comforters to you? Have not his servants come to you to search, to overthrow and to spy out the land?
{19:4} Therefore Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, at their buttocks, and sent them away.
{19:5} Then some went and reported to David about the men; and he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.
{19:6} And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the sons of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Syrian Naharaim, from Syrian Maachah, and from Zobah.
{19:7} So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, with the king of Maachah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. Also the sons of Ammon gathered together from their cities, and came to battle.
{19:8} And when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men.
{19:9} And the sons of Ammon came out and put themselves in battle array before the entrance to the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.
{19:10} And when Joab saw that the battle line was against him before and behind, he chose some of Israel’s choice ones and put them in battle array to meet the Syrians.
{19:11} And the rest of the people he put into the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in battle array against the sons of Ammon.
{19:12} And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.
{19:13} Be of good courage, and let us be strong for our people and for the cities of our God; and may Jehovah do what is good in His eyes.
{19:14} So Joab and the people who were with him drew near for the battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him.
{19:15} And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they also fled before Abishai his brother, and entered the city. So Joab came to Jerusalem.
{19:16} So when the Syrians saw that they had been struck down before Israel, they sent messengers and brought the Syrians who were beyond the River, and Shophach the commander of Hadadezer’s army went before them.
{19:17} And when it was reported to David, he gathered all Israel, crossed over the Jordan and came upon them, and set up in battle array against them. So when David had set up in battle array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
{19:18} And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers of the Syrians, and killed Shophach the commander of the army.
{19:19} And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been struck down before Israel, they made peace with David and served him. So the Syrians were not willing to help the sons of Ammon anymore.
{20:1} It happened at the time of the return of the year, at the time kings go out to battle, that Joab led out the armed forces and ravaged the land of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah and overthrew it.
{20:2} And David took their king’s crown from his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it. And it was set on David’s head. Also he brought out the spoils of the city; a very great amount.
{20:3} And he brought out the people who were in it, and cut them with saws, with iron picks, and with axes. Thus David did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
{20:4} And it happened afterward that war rose up at Gezer with the Philistines, at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Sippai, who was born to the giant. And they were subdued.
{20:5} Again there was war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
{20:6} Yet again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, with twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand and six on each foot; and he also had been born to the giant.
{20:7} So when he reproached Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him.
{20:8} These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
{21:1} Now Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.
{21:2} And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba to Dan, and bring the number of them to me that I may know it.
{21:3} And Joab answered, May Jehovah make His people a hundred times more than they are. But, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? Why then does my lord desire this thing? Why should he be a cause of guilt to Israel?
{21:4} Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem.
{21:5} And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. All Israel had one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and Judah had four hundred and seventy thousand men who drew the sword.
{21:6} But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s word was abhorrent to Joab.
{21:7} And this thing caused the eye of God to quiver; therefore He struck Israel.
{21:8} So David said to God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing; but now, I pray, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.
{21:9} And Jehovah spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying,
{21:10} Go and speak to David, saying, Thus says Jehovah: I offer you three things; choose one of them for yourself, that I may do it to you.
{21:11} So Gad came to David and said to him, Thus says Jehovah: Choose for yourself,
{21:12} either three years of famine, or three months of being defeated before your foes with the sword of your enemies overtaking you, or else for three days the sword of Jehovah; the plague in the land, with the Angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the territory of Israel. Now consider what word I shall return to the One sending me.
{21:13} And David said to Gad, I am in great distress. Please let me fall into the hand of Jehovah, for His mercies are very great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.
{21:14} So Jehovah sent a plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.
{21:15} And God sent the Angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was destroying, Jehovah looked and was moved to compassion regarding the evil, and said to the Angel who was destroying, It is enough; now restrain Your hand. And the Angel of Jehovah stood by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
{21:16} And David lifted his eyes and saw the Angel of Jehovah standing between earth and the heavens, having in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. And David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
{21:17} And David said to God, Was it not I who commanded the people to be numbered? I am the one who has sinned and done evil indeed; but these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, O Jehovah my God, be against me and my father’s house, but not against Your people to be plagued.
{21:18} And the Angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David that David should go and set up an altar unto Jehovah on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
{21:19} So David went up at the word of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of Jehovah.
{21:20} And Ornan turned and saw the Angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan had been threshing wheat.
{21:21} And David came to Ornan, and Ornan looked and saw David. And he went out from the threshing floor, and bowed to David with his face to the ground.
{21:22} And David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar on it unto Jehovah. You shall give it to me for the full price, that the plague may be restrained from the people.
{21:23} And Ornan said to David, Take it to yourself, and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes. See, I have also given you the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing implements for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering; I have given it all.
{21:24} And King David said to Ornan, No, but I will buy to acquire it for the full price, for I will not take away what is yours for Jehovah, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.
{21:25} So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.
{21:26} And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon Jehovah; and He answered him from the heavens by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.
{21:27} And Jehovah commanded the Angel, and He returned His sword to its sheath.
{21:28} At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
{21:29} For the tabernacle of Jehovah and the altar of the burnt offering, which Moses had made in the wilderness, were at that time at the high place in Gibeon.
{21:30} But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he had been terrified of the sword of the Angel of Jehovah.
{22:1} Then David said, This is the house of Jehovah God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.
{22:2} And David commanded to gather the sojourners in the land of Israel; and he appointed masons to cut hewn stones to build the house of God.
{22:3} And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails of the doors of the gates and for the joints, and bronze in abundance beyond weight,
{22:4} and cedar timber without number; for the Sidonians and those from Tyre brought cedar timber to David in abundance.
{22:5} And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house to be built for Jehovah must be exceedingly magnificent, for fame and glory throughout all lands. I will now make preparation for it. So David made abundant preparations before his death.
{22:6} And he summoned his son Solomon, and charged him to build a house for Jehovah the God of Israel.
{22:7} And David said to Solomon: My son, as for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Jehovah my God;
{22:8} but the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, You have shed much blood and have made great wars; you shall not build a house for My name, because you have shed much blood on the earth before Me.
{22:9} Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be Solomon, for I will give peace and tranquillity to Israel in his days.
{22:10} He shall build a house for My name, and he shall be My son, and I will be his Father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.
{22:11} Now, my son, may Jehovah be with you; and may you prosper, and build the house of Jehovah your God, as He has spoken concerning you.
{22:12} Only may Jehovah give you wisdom and understanding, and give you charge concerning Israel, to keep the Law of Jehovah your God.
{22:13} Then you will prosper, if you take care to fulfill the statutes and judgments which Jehovah has commanded Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and of good courage; do not fear nor be dismayed.
{22:14} Now behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah one hundred thousand talents of gold and one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weight, for it is in abundance. I have prepared timber and stone also, and you may add to them.
{22:15} Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance: hewers and craftsmen in stone and timber, and wise men for every kind of work.
{22:16} There is no counting the gold and silver and bronze and iron. Arise and get to work; for Jehovah is with you.
{22:17} David also commanded all the rulers of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
{22:18} Is not Jehovah your God with you? And has He not given you rest all around? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land has been subdued before Jehovah and before His people.
{22:19} Now give your hearts and your souls to seek Jehovah your God. Therefore arise and build the sanctuary of Jehovah God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for the name of Jehovah.
{23:1} So when David was old and satisfied with days, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.
{23:2} And he gathered together all the rulers of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
{23:3} Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and above; and the head count of the men was thirty-eight thousand.
{23:4} Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Jehovah, six thousand officers and judges,
{23:5} four thousand gatekeepers, and four thousand for praising Jehovah with instruments, which I have made, said David, to give praise.
{23:6} David also divided them into divisions among the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
{23:7} The Gershonites: Laadan and Shimei.
{23:8} The sons of Laadan: the first Jehiel, then Zetham and Joel; three.
{23:9} The sons of Shimei: Shelomith, Haziel, and Haran; three. These were the heads of the fathers of Laadan.
{23:10} And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah; these, the four sons of Shimei.
{23:11} Jahath was the first and Zizah the second. But Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; therefore they were reckoned as one father’s house.
{23:12} The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel; four.
{23:13} The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was set apart, he and his sons perpetually, that he should consecrate the set apart, holy things, to burn incense before Jehovah, to serve Him, and to bless in His name perpetually.
{23:14} The sons of Moses the man of God were reckoned to the tribe of Levi.
{23:15} The sons of Moses: Gershon and Eliezer.
{23:16} The sons of Gershon: Shebuel was head.
{23:17} The sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah was head. And Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
{23:18} The sons of Izhar: Shelomith was head.
{23:19} The sons of Hebron: Jeriah was the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
{23:20} The sons of Uzziel: Michah was the first and Jesshiah the second.
{23:21} The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
{23:22} And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but only daughters; and their brethren, the sons of Kish, took them as wives.
{23:23} The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth; three.
{23:24} These were the sons of Levi by their fathers’ houses; heads of fathers as they were reckoned by the number of names by head count, who did the work for the service of the house of Jehovah, from the age of twenty years and above.
{23:25} For David had said, Jehovah the God of Israel has given rest to His people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem always;
{23:26} and also to the Levites, They shall no longer need to carry the tabernacle, nor any of the vessels for its service.
{23:27} For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above;
{23:28} because their function was to give a hand to the sons of Aaron in the service of the house of Jehovah, in the courts and in the chambers, in the purifying of all holy things and the work of the service of the house of God,
{23:29} both with the Bread in Rows and the fine flour for the grain offering, with the unleavened cakes and what is in the pans, with what is mixed and with all kinds of measures and sizes;
{23:30} to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise at evening;
{23:31} and to offer the burnt offerings unto Jehovah on the Sabbaths and on the new moons and on the set feasts, by number according to their ordinance, continually before Jehovah;
{23:32} and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren in the service of the house of Jehovah.
{24:1} These are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
{24:2} And Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no sons; and Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.
{24:3} And David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to the office of their service.
{24:4} There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus they were divided. Among the sons of Eleazar were sixteen chief men of their fathers’ houses, and eight heads of their fathers’ houses among the sons of Ithamar.
{24:5} Thus they were divided by lot, these and these; for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of the house of God, from the sons of Eleazar and from the sons of Ithamar.
{24:6} And the scribe, Shemaiah the son of Nethanel, one of the Levites, wrote them down before the king, the rulers, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers of the priests and Levites, one father’s house taken for Eleazar and one for Ithamar.
{24:7} The first lot came out to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
{24:8} the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
{24:9} the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
{24:10} the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
{24:11} the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
{24:12} the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
{24:13} the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
{24:14} the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
{24:15} the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Pizzez,
{24:16} the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel,
{24:17} the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
{24:18} the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
{24:19} This was the assignment of their service to come into the house of Jehovah according to their ordinance by the hand of Aaron their father, as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded him.
{24:20} And for the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.
{24:21} For Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.
{24:22} Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.
{24:23} Of the sons of Hebron, Jeriah was the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
{24:24} Of the sons of Uzziel, Michah; of the sons of Michah, Shamir.
{24:25} The brother of Michah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.
{24:26} The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The son of Jaaziah: Beno.
{24:27} The sons of Merari by Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
{24:28} Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.
{24:29} Of Kish, the son of Kish: Jerahmeel.
{24:30} The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites according to their fathers’ houses.
{24:31} These also cast lots, as their brothers the sons of Aaron did, in the presence of King David: Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the priests and Levites, and the chief fathers, as well as their younger brethren.
{25:1} Moreover David and the commanders of the army separated for the service some of the sons of Asaph, of Heman, and of Jeduthun, for prophesying with harps, lutes, and cymbals. And the number of the skilled men performing their service,
{25:2} of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah; the sons of Asaph were under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied under the hand of the king.
{25:3} Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah; six; under the hand of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with the harp to give thanks and to praise Jehovah.
{25:4} Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth.
{25:5} All these were the sons of Heman the king’s seer in the Words of God, to exalt his horn; for God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
{25:6} All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of Jehovah, with cymbals, lutes, and harps, for the service of the house of God, under the hand of the king: Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.
{25:7} So the number of them, with their brethren who were trained in the songs of Jehovah, all with understanding: two hundred and eighty-eight.
{25:8} And they cast lots for their duties, small and great, teacher and scholar.
{25:9} The first lot for Asaph came out for Joseph. The second for Gedaliah, him with his brethren and sons; twelve.
{25:10} The third for Zaccur, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:11} The fourth for Jizri, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:12} The fifth for Nethaniah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:13} The sixth for Bukkiah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:14} The seventh for Jesharelah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:15} The eighth for Jeshaiah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:16} The ninth for Mattaniah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:17} The tenth for Shimei, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:18} The eleventh for Azarel, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:19} The twelfth for Hashabiah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:20} The thirteenth for Shubael, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:21} The fourteenth for Mattithiah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:22} The fifteenth for Jeremoth, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:23} The sixteenth for Hananiah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:24} The seventeenth for Joshbekashah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:25} The eighteenth for Hanani, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:26} The nineteenth for Mallothi, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:27} The twentieth for Eliathah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:28} The twenty-first for Hothir, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:29} The twenty-second for Giddalti, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:30} The twenty-third for Mahazioth, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{25:31} The twenty-fourth for Romamti-Ezer, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
{26:1} The divisions of the gatekeepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.
{26:2} The sons of Meshelemiah: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,
{26:3} Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh.
{26:4} The sons of Obed-Edom: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sacar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth,
{26:5} Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth; for God blessed him.
{26:6} Also sons were born to Shemaiah his son, who ruled their fathers’ houses, for they were mighty men of valor.
{26:7} The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad; whose brothers Elihu and Semachiah were men of valor.
{26:8} All these were of the sons of Obed-Edom, they and their sons and their brethren, mighty men of valor for the service: sixty-two of Obed-Edom.
{26:9} And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, eighteen men of valor.
{26:10} Also Hosah, of the sons of Merari, had sons: Shimri the first (for though he was not the firstborn, his father made him the first),
{26:11} Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth; all the sons and brethren of Hosah, thirteen.
{26:12} Among these were the divisions of the gatekeepers, among the chief men, having duties just like their brethren, to serve in the house of Jehovah.
{26:13} And they cast lots for each gate, the small and the great, according to their father’s house.
{26:14} The lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. And they cast lots for his son Zechariah, a wise counselor, and his lot came out for the north.
{26:15} To Obed-Edom the south, and to his sons the storehouse.
{26:16} To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came out for the west, for the Shallecheth Gate ascending to the highway; guard next to guard.
{26:17} On the east were six Levites, on the north four each day, on the south four each day, and for the storehouse two and two.
{26:18} As for the Parbar on the west, there were four at the highway and two at the Parbar.
{26:19} These were the divisions of the gatekeepers among the sons of Korah and among the sons of Merari.
{26:20} Of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasuries of the house of God and over the treasuries of the dedicated things.
{26:21} The sons of Laadan, the sons of the Gershonites of Laadan, heads of their fathers, of Laadan the Gershonite: Jehieli.
{26:22} The sons of Jehieli: Zetham and Joel his brother were over the treasuries of the house of Jehovah.
{26:23} Of the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites:
{26:24} Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of the treasuries.
{26:25} His brethren by Eliezer: Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son.
{26:26} This Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasuries of the dedicated things which King David and the heads of fathers, the commanders over thousands and hundreds, and the commanders of the army, had consecrated.
{26:27} Some of the spoils won in battles they consecrated to maintain the house of Jehovah.
{26:28} And all that Samuel the seer, Saul the son of Kish, Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah had consecrated, every dedicated thing, was under the hand of Shelomith and his brethren.
{26:29} Of the Izharites: Chenaniah and his sons were over the external business over Israel of the officials and judges.
{26:30} Of the Hebronites: Hashabiah and his brethren, one thousand seven hundred able men, had the oversight of Israel on the west side of the Jordan for all the business of Jehovah, and in the service of the king.
{26:31} Of the Hebronites: Jerijah was head of the Hebronites according to the generations of his fathers. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at Jazer of Gilead.
{26:32} And his brethren were two thousand seven hundred men of valor, heads of fathers, whom King David made overseers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God and the matters of the king.
{27:1} And the sons of Israel, according to their number, the heads of fathers, the commanders of thousands and hundreds and their officers, served the king in every matter in their divisions. These divisions came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year; each division having twenty-four thousand.
{27:2} Over the first division for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel, and in his division were twenty-four thousand;
{27:3} he was of the sons of Perez, and chief of all the commanders of the army for the first month.
{27:4} Over the division of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite, and of his division Mikloth also was the ruler; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
{27:5} The third commander of the army for the third month was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the chief priest; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
{27:6} This was the Benaiah who was mighty among the thirty, and was over the thirty; in his division was Ammizabad his son.
{27:7} The fourth for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
{27:8} The fifth commander for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
{27:9} The sixth for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
{27:10} The seventh for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of the sons of Ephraim; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
{27:11} The eighth for the eighth month was Sibbechai the Hushathite, of the Zarhites; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
{27:12} The ninth for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anathothite, of the Benjamites; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
{27:13} The tenth for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zarhites; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
{27:14} The eleventh for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the sons of Ephraim; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
{27:15} The twelfth for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
{27:16} Furthermore, over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the Reubenites, Eliezer the son of Zichri; of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maachah;
{27:17} of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel; of the Aaronites, Zadok;
{27:18} of Judah, Elihu, one of David’s brothers; of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael;
{27:19} of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah; of Naphtali, Jerimoth the son of Azriel;
{27:20} of the sons of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah; of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah;
{27:21} of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah; of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner;
{27:22} of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the rulers over the tribes of Israel.
{27:23} But David did not take the number of those twenty years old and under, because Jehovah had said He would multiply Israel like the stars of the heavens.
{27:24} Joab the son of Zeruiah began to count, but he did not finish, for wrath came upon Israel because of this; nor was the number recorded in the account of the chronicles of King David.
{27:25} Azmaveth the son of Adiel was over the king’s treasuries; and Jehonathan the son of Uzziah was over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, in the villages, and in the towers.
{27:26} Ezri the son of Chelub was over those who did the work of the field for working the land.
{27:27} And Shimei the Ramathite was over the vineyards, and Zabdi the Shiphmite was over the produce of the vineyards for the supply of wine.
{27:28} Baal-Hanan the Gederite was over the olive trees and the sycamore trees in the lowlands, and Joash was over the supply of oil.
{27:29} And Shitrai the Sharonite was over the herds that fed in Sharon, and Shaphat the son of Adlai was over the herds in the valleys.
{27:30} Obil the Ishmaelite was over the camels, Jehdeiah the Meronothite was over the donkeys,
{27:31} and Jaziz the Hagrite was over the flocks. All these were the officials over King David’s property.
{27:32} Also Jehonathan, David’s uncle, was a counselor, a wise man, and a scribe; and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king’s sons.
{27:33} Ahithophel was the king’s counselor, and Hushai the Archite was the king’s friend.
{27:34} After Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, then Abiathar. And the commander of the king’s army was Joab.
{28:1} Now David assembled at Jerusalem all the rulers of Israel: the chiefs of the tribes and the leaders of the divisions who served the king, the commanders over thousands and commanders over hundreds, and the officials over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the overseers, the mighty men, and all the men of valor.
{28:2} And King David rose to his feet and said, Hear me, my brethren and my people: I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and for the footstool of our God, and had made preparations to build it.
{28:3} But God has said to me, You shall not build a house for My name, because you have been a man of war and have shed blood.
{28:4} However Jehovah the God of Israel chose me above all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever, for He has chosen Judah as the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father, He has been pleased to make me king over all Israel.
{28:5} And of all my sons (for Jehovah has given me many sons) He has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of Jehovah, over Israel.
{28:6} And He said to me, Your son Solomon shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him as My son, and I will be his Father.
{28:7} Moreover I will establish his kingdom forever, if he prevails to do My commandments and My judgments, as it is this day.
{28:8} Now therefore, in the eyes of all Israel the assembly of Jehovah, and in the ears of our God, take heed to seek out all the commandments of Jehovah your God, that you may possess this good land, and leave it as an inheritance for your children after you always.
{28:9} As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Jehovah searches all hearts and understands all the intent of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever.
{28:10} Consider now, for Jehovah has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong, and do it.
{28:11} Then David gave his son Solomon the pattern for the porch, its houses, its treasuries, its upper chambers, its inner chambers, and the place of the mercy seat;
{28:12} and the pattern for all that he had by the Spirit, of the courts of the house of Jehovah, of all the chambers all around, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries for the consecrated things;
{28:13} also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and for all the vessels of service in the house of Jehovah.
{28:14} Gold by weight for the things of gold, for all the vessels used in every kind of service; also silver for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all the vessels used in every kind of service;
{28:15} the weight for the lampstands of gold, and their lamps of gold, by weight for each lampstand and its lamps; for the lampstands of silver by weight, for the lampstand and its lamps, according to the service of each lampstand.
{28:16} And by weight, the gold for the tables of the Bread in Rows, for each table, and silver for the tables of silver;
{28:17} also pure gold for the forks, the bowls, the pitchers of pure gold, and the golden basins; gold by weight for every basin; and for the silver basins, silver by weight for every basin;
{28:18} and refined gold by weight for the altar of incense, and for the construction of the chariot, that is, the gold cherubim that spread their wings and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.
{28:19} All this, said David, Jehovah has given me insight in writing, by His hand upon me, all these patterns of the workmanship.
{28:20} And David said to his son Solomon, Be strong and of good courage, and do it; do not fear nor be dismayed, for Jehovah God, my God, will be with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you, until you have finished all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah.
{28:21} Behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and every willing man of wisdom will be with you for all manner of workmanship, for every kind of service; also the rulers and all the people are here for whatever you say.
{29:1} Furthermore King David said to all the assembly: My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and tender; and the work is great, because the temple is not for man but for Jehovah God.
{29:2} Now for the house of my God I have prepared with all my might: gold for things to be made of gold, silver for things of silver, bronze for things of bronze, iron for things of iron, wood for things of wood, onyx stones, stones to be set, antimony and of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and alabaster stones in abundance.
{29:3} Moreover, because of my determination regarding the house of my God, I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the house of the sanctuary, from my own possessions of gold and silver:
{29:4} three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses;
{29:5} the gold for things of gold and the silver for things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be done by the hands of craftsmen. Who then is willing to consecrate his hand this day unto Jehovah?
{29:6} Then the heads of the fathers, chiefs of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with the officers over the king’s business, offered free-will offerings.
{29:7} They gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
{29:8} And those with whom precious stones were found, gave them to the treasury of the house of Jehovah, into the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
{29:9} And the people rejoiced, for they had offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they had offered willingly unto Jehovah; and King David also rejoiced with great joy.
{29:10} And David blessed Jehovah before the eyes of all the assembly, and David said: Blessed are You, Jehovah the God of Israel, our Father, forever and ever.
{29:11} Yours, O Jehovah, is the greatness, the power and the glory, the victory and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and on earth is Yours; Yours is the kingdom, O Jehovah, and You are exalted as head over all.
{29:12} Both riches and honor come from before You, and You reign over all. In Your hand is power and might; it is in Your hand to make great and to give strength to all.
{29:13} Now therefore, our God, we are giving thanks to You and praising Your glorious name.
{29:14} But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things are from You, and out of Your own hand we have given to You.
{29:15} For we are strangers and sojourners before You, as were all our fathers; our days on earth are as a shadow, and there is no hope.
{29:16} O Jehovah our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build You a house for Your holy name is out of Your hand, and is all Your own.
{29:17} I know also, my God, that You examine the heart and take pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things; and now with joy I have seen Your people who are found here, to offer willingly to You.
{29:18} O Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the intent of the thoughts of the heart of Your people, and fix their heart toward You.
{29:19} And give my son Solomon a perfect heart to keep Your commandments and Your testimonies and Your statutes, to do all these things, and to build the temple for which I have made provision.
{29:20} And David said to all the assembly, Now bless Jehovah your God. So all the assembly blessed Jehovah the God of their fathers, and bowed down and prostrated themselves before Jehovah and the king.
{29:21} And they slaughtered sacrifices unto Jehovah and offered burnt offerings unto Jehovah on the next day: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
{29:22} And they ate and drank before Jehovah with great gladness that day. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him before Jehovah as the prince, and Zadok as priest.
{29:23} And Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
{29:24} All the rulers and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, set themselves under the hand of King Solomon.
{29:25} Thus Jehovah highly magnified Solomon in the eyes of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
{29:26} Thus David the son of Jesse had reigned over all Israel.
{29:27} And the days that he reigned over Israel were forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem.
{29:28} And he died in a good old age, satisfied with days, riches and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place.
{29:29} Now the acts of King David, first and last, behold they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer;
{29:30} of all his reign and his might, and the events that happened to him, to Israel, and to all the kingdoms of the lands.
