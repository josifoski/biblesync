{i1:1} Greeting
{1:1} Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved friend and fellow laborer,
{1:2} to the beloved Apphia, Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:
{1:3} Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
{i1:4} Philemon’s Love and Faith
{1:4} I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,
{1:5} hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,
{1:6} that the sharing of your faith may become effective by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
{1:7} For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.
{i1:8} The Plea for Onesimus
{1:8} Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command you what is fitting,
{1:9} yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you — being such a one as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ —
{1:10} I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten while in my chains,
{1:11} who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable to you and to me.
{1:12} I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,
{1:13} whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might minister to me in my chains for the gospel.
{1:14} But without your consent I wanted to do nothing, that your good deed might not be by compulsion, as it were, but voluntary.
{1:15} For perhaps he departed for a while for this purpose, that you might receive him forever,
{1:16} no longer as a slave but more than a slave — a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
{i1:17} Philemon’s Obedience Encouraged
{1:17} If then you count me as a partner, receive him as you would me.
{1:18} But if he has wronged you or owes anything, put that on my account.
{1:19} I, Paul, am writing with my own hand. I will repay — not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self besides.
{1:20} Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord.
{1:21} Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
{1:22} But, meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for I trust that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.
{i1:23} Farewell
{1:23} Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
{1:24} as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers.
{1:25} The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
