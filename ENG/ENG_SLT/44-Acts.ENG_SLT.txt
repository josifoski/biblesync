{1:1} Truly the first word had I made of all things, O Theophilus, of which Jesus began to do and also to teach,
{1:2} Till the day having commanded the sent whom he chose through the Holy Spirit, he was taken up:
{1:3} To them also he presented himself living, after he suffered, by many infallible signs, through forty days seen to them, and speaking the things of the kingdom of God:
{1:4} And, being collected together, he enjoined them not to be separated from Jerusalem, but to wait for the solemn promise of the Father, which ye heard of me.
{1:5} For John truly immersed in water; and ye shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit not after these many days.
{1:6} Truly they therefore having come together, asked him, saying, Lord, if in this time thou wilt restore the kingdom of Israel?
{1:7} And he said to them, It is not yours to know the times and occasions, which the Father fixed in his own power.
{1:8} But ye shall receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses to me also in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even to the last of the earth.
{1:9} And having said these, they beholding, he was lifted up; and a cloud received him from their eyes.
{1:10} And as they were looking intently to heaven, he going, behold, two men were standing before them in white raiment;
{1:11} And they said, Galilean men, why stand ye looking to heaven this Jesus, taken up from you to heaven, so shall he come which manner ye saw him going to heaven.
{1:12} Then returned they to Jerusalem from the mount called Olive, which is near Jerusalem, having the way of a sabbath.
{1:13} And when they came in, they went up into an upper room, where were remaining also Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas of James.
{1:14} All these were persevering unanimously in prayer and supplication, with women, and Mary mother of Jesus, with his brethren.
{1:15} And in these days Peter having risen in the midst of the disciples, said, (also the crowd of names together was about an hundred and twenty,)
{1:16} Men, brethren, this writing must be filled up, which the Holy Spirit spake before by mouth of David concerning Judas, being guide to them having taken Jesus.
{1:17} For he was numbered with us, and obtained the lot of this service.
{1:18} Truly this therefore purchased a place from the wages of iniquity; and being bent forward, he brake in pieces in the midst, and all his entrails were poured out.
{1:19} And it was known to all dwelling in Jerusalem; so that that place was called in their own dialect, Aceldama, that is, The place of blood.
{1:20} For it has been written, in the book of Psalms, Let his country-house be a desert, and let none be dwelling in it: and his inspection may another take.
{1:21} Therefore must there, of these men having come with us in all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and came out among us,
{1:22} Having begun from the immersion of John, unto the day which he was taken up from us, be one of these a witness with you of his rising up.
{1:23} And they set two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
{1:24} And having prayed, they said, Thou, O Lord, knowing hearts of all, spew forth one of two which thou hast chosen,
{1:25} To take the lot of this service and sending forth, from which Judas passed by, to go to his own place.
{1:26} And he gave their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was voted together with the eleven sent.
{2:1} And in the day of Pentecost being completed, they were all unanimously in one and the same place.
{2:2} And suddenly was a sound from heaven as of a wind moving violently, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
{2:3} And seen to them were tongues divided as fire, and it sat upon each one of them.
{2:4} And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them to utter.
{2:5} And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, circumspect men, from every nation of those under heaven.
{2:6} And there having been this voice, the multitude came together, and were disturbed, for each one heard them speaking in his own dialect.
{2:7} And all were affected in mind and wondered, saying to one another, Behold, are not these speaking Galileans.
{2:8} And how hear we each in our own dialect, in which we were born?
{2:9} Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and they dwelling in Mesopotamia, and Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,
{2:10} And Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and parts of Lybia that near Cyrene, and Romans arriving as strangers, and Jews, and strangers,
{2:11} Cretes and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the great things of God.
{2:12} And all were affected in mind, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What may this mean to be?
{2:13} And others mocking said, That they are filled with new wine.
{2:14} And Peter, having stood with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, Men Jews, and all ye dwelling in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and hear ye my words:
{2:15} For not, as ye suppose, are these intoxicated, (for it is the third hour of the day.)
{2:16} But this is that spoken by the prophet Joel;
{2:17} And it shall be in the last days, says God, I pour out from my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your elder dream dreams:
{2:18} And also upon my servants and upon my maids in those days will I pour out from my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:
{2:19} And I will give wonders in heaven above, and signs upon the earth below; blood, and fire, and steam of smoke:
{2:20} The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and distinguished day of the Lord come:
{2:21} And it shall be, every one, who shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.
{2:22} Men, Israelites, bear these words; Jesus the Nazarite, a man elected by God for you by powers and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, (as also ye yourselves know:)
{2:23} This one, surrendered by the fixed counsel and foreknowledge of God, having taken by lawless hands, having fastened, ye slew:
{2:24} Whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death: as it was not possible for him to be holden of it.
{2:25} For David says about him, I saw beforehand the Lord before me always, for he is of my right hand, that I be not moved:
{2:26} For this my heart was gladdened, and my tongue was transported with joy; and yet also shall my flesh encamp in hope:
{2:27} For thou wilt not leave my soul in hades neither wilt thou give thy sanctified one to see corruption.
{2:28} Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt fill me with gladness with thy face.
{2:29} Men, brethren, it is permitted to speak with freedom of speech to you of the patriarch David, for he died and was buried, and his tomb is with us even till this day.
{2:30} Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God swore with an oath to him, of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, to raise up Christ to sit upon his throne:
{2:31} Foreknowing, he spake of the rising up of Christ, that his soul was not left in hades, neither did his flesh see corruption.
{2:32} This Jesus God raised up, of which all we are witnesses.
{2:33} Therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he poured out this, which ye now see and hear.
{2:34} For David ascended not into the heavens: and he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit from my right hand,
{2:35} Even till I set thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.
{2:36} Therefore let all the house of Israel know certainly, that God made him Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified.
{2:37} And having heard, they were pricked in heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the sent, What shall we do, men, brethren?
{2:38} And Peter said to them, Repent, and be each of you immersed in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
{2:39} For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all afar off, as many as the Lord our God should call.
{2:40} And with many other words he appealed earnestly and besought, saying, Be ye saved from this crooked generation.
{2:41} Then truly they having gladly received his word were immersed: and in that day were added about three thousand souls.
{2:42} And they were persevering in the teaching of the sent, and in mutual participation, and breaking of bread, and prayers.
{2:43} And to every soul was fear: and through the sent were many wonders and signs.
{2:44} And all believing were in one and the same place, and had all things common:
{2:45} And sold possessions and goods, and divided them to all, as any one had need.
{2:46} And in the day persevering unanimously in the temple, and breaking bread in the house, they partook of food with lively joy and simplicity of heart,
{2:47} Praising God, and having favor with the whole people. And in the day the Lord added the saved to the church.
{3:1} And Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth.
{3:2} And a certain man, being lame from his mother's womb, was carried, whom they set in the day at the door of the temple called Beautiful, to ask alms from those going into the temple;
{3:3} Who having seen Peter and John about going into the temple asked to receive alms.
{3:4} And Peter, having looked intently upon him with John, said, Look upon us.
{3:5} And he fixed his attention upon them, expecting to receive something of them.
{3:6} And Peter said, Silver and gold are not to me; but what I have, this I give thee: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarite, arise and walk.
{3:7} And having taken him by the right hand, he raised: and immediately his feet and ankles were rendered firm.
{3:8} And springing forth he stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and springing, and praising God.
{3:9} And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
{3:10} And they knew him, that this was he sitting for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that having happened to him.
{3:11} And the lame healed holding Peter and John, all the people ran to them in the porch called Solomon's, much amazed.
{3:12} And Peter, having seen, answered to the people, men, Israelites, why wonder ye at this? or why look ye intently at us, as by our own power or devotion having made him to walk?
{3:13} The God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, God of our fathers, has honoured his child Jesus; whom ye have delivered up, and denied him before the face of Pilate, he having judged to loose.
{3:14} And ye denied the Holy and Just, and demanded a man, a murderer, to be yielded to you.
{3:15} And ye killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead; of whom we are witnesses.
{3:16} And by faith of his name, this, whom ye see and know, his name made firm, and faith which by him, gave him this completeness before you all.
{3:17} And now, brethren, I know that ye did in ignorance, as also your rulers.
{3:18} But God, announced these things beforehand by the mouth of all his prophets, for Christ to suffer, he so completed.
{3:19} Therefore repent, and return, for your sins to be wiped out, so that times of refreshment might come from the face of the Lord;
{3:20} And he send Jesus Christ, before proclaimed to you,
{3:21} Whom heaven must truly receive till time of restoration of all which God spake by the mouth of all his holy prophets from forever.
{3:22} For Moses truly said to the fathers, That a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you from your brethren, like me; him shall ye hear according to all whatever he speak to you.
{3:23} And it shall be, whoever hears not that prophet, shall be destroyed from the people.
{3:24} And all the prophets from Samuel, and those in order, as many as spake, also announced beforehand these days.
{3:25} Ye are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God set with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy seed shall all families of earth be praised.
{3:26} To you first God, having raised up his child Jesus, sent him praising you, in turning away each from your wickedness.
{4:1} And they speaking to the people, the priests, and commander of the temple, and the Sadducees, resisted them,
{4:2} Being exercised because they taught the people, and announced in Jesus the rising up from the dead.
{4:3} And they put hands upon them, and set in guard for the morrow: for it was already evening.
{4:4} And many of them having heard the word, believed; and the number of men was about five thousand.
{4:5} And it was on the morrow, their rulers, and elders, and scribes, were gathered together at Jerusalem,
{4:6} And Annas, chief priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the lineage of the chief priest.
{4:7} And having set them in the midst, they inquired, In what power, or in what name did ye do this?
{4:8} Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
{4:9} If we are this day examined of the kindness of the sick man, by whom he has been saved;
{4:10} Be it known to all you, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarite, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in this he stands before you whole.
{4:11} This is the stone set at nought by you building, he having been for the head of the corner.
{4:12} And salvation is in no other: for neither is another name given under heaven among men, in which we must be saved.
{4:13} And seeing the freedom of speech of Peter and John, and comprehending that they are illiterate men, and private individuals, they wondered; and they knew them, that they were with Jesus.
{4:14} And seeing the man healed standing with them, they had nothing to contradict.
{4:15} And having urged them to depart out of the council, they deliberated with one another,
{4:16} Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that truly a known sign has been by them, manifest to all them dwelling in Jerusalem: and we cannot deny.
{4:17} But that it be not more and more exposed to the wind among the people, let us threaten them with a threat, to speak no more in this name to any man.
{4:18} And having called them, they enjoined them universally not to utter neither to teach in the name of Jesus.
{4:19} And Peter and John having answered to them, said, If it is just before God to hear you rather than God, judge ye.
{4:20} For we cannot, the things we have seen and heard, not speak.
{4:21} And they having made additional threats, loosed them, finding nothing how they might chastise them, for sake of the people: for all honoured God for that having been done.
{4:22} For the man was more than forty years, upon whom this sign of healing was done.
{4:23} And having been loosed, they came to their own, and announced to them what the chief priests and elders said.
{4:24} And they, having heard, lifted up the voice unanimously to God, and said, Sovereign, thou God having made heaven, and earth, and sea, and all things which in them:
{4:25} Having said by the mouth of David thy servant, That why were the nations insolent, and did the people practise vain things.
{4:26} Kings of the earth stood up, and rulers were gathered together upon one and the same, against the Lord, and against his Christ.
{4:27} For against the truth were they gathered together against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations and peoples of Israel,
{4:28} To do what thy hands and thy counsel predestinated to be.
{4:29} And now, Lord, look upon their threats: and give to thy servants, with all freedom of speech to speak thy word,
{4:30} In thy stretching out thy hand for healing; and signs and wonders to be for the name of thine holy child Jesus.
{4:31} And they having prayed, the place was shaken in which they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spake the word of God with freedom of speech.
{4:32} And the heart and soul of the multitude of them believing were one: and not one said any of the things being to him to be his own; but all were common to them.
{4:33} And in great power the sent gave back testimony of the rising up of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
{4:34} For neither was any in want among them: for as many as were possessors of farms or houses, selling, brought the prices of things sold,
{4:35} And laid down at the feet of the sent: and it was distributed to each as any had need.
{4:36} And Joses, surnamed Barnabas by the sent, (which is interpreted, Son of consolation,) a Levite, a Cyprian by birth,
{4:37} A field being to him having sold, he brought the money and laid at the feet of the sent.
{5:1} And a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
{5:2} And separated from the price, his wife also knowing; and having brought a certain part, laid at the feet of the sent.
{5:3} And Peter said, Ananias, wherefore filled Satan thy heart, for thee to belie the Holy Spirit, and separate from the price of the farm.
{5:4} Remaining, did it not remain to thee? and sold, it was in thy power: for what hast thou put this thing in thy heart? thou hast not lied to men, but to God.
{5:5} And Ananias hearing these words, having fallen down, he expired: and great fear was upon all them hearing these things.
{5:6} And the younger having risen up, drew him together, and having carried out, interred.
{5:7} And there was an interval of about three hours, and his wife not knowing that done, came in.
{5:8} And Peter answered to her, Tell me, if for so much ye sold the farm? And she said, Yes, for so much.
{5:9} And Peter said to her, For what was it agreed by you to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them having interred thy husband at the door, and they shall carry thee out.
{5:10} And she fell immediately at his feet, and expired: and the young men having come in, found her dead, and having carried out, interred near her husband.
{5:11} And great fear was upon the whole church, and upon all having heard these things.
{5:12} And by the bands of the sent were many signs and wonders among the people; (and all were unanimously in Solomon's porch.
{5:13} And of them remaining none dared join them: but the people magnified them.
{5:14} And the believing were the more added to the Lord, multitudes of men and also of women.)
{5:15} So that the sick were brought into the streets, and laid upon beds and couches, that Peter coming, even the shadow might overshadow certain of them.
{5:16} And a multitude also came together of them all around the cities to Jerusalem, bringing the sick, and the molested by unclean spirits: who were all healed.
{5:17} And the chief priest having risen, and all they with him, (the sect being of the Sadducees,) they were filled with zeal,
{5:18} And put their hands upon the sent, and set them in the public keeping.
{5:19} And a messenger of the Lord by night opened the doors of the prison, and having brought them forth, said,
{5:20} Go ye, and having stood, speak in the temple all the words of this life.
{5:21} And having heard, they came in by morning to the temple, and taught. But the chief priest having approached, and they with him, called the council together, and all the assembly of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison for them to be brought.
{5:22} And the attendants having come near, found them not in the prison, and having returned, they announced,
{5:23} Saying, That we truly found the prison shut with all security, and the watch standing without before the doors: and having opened, we found none within.
{5:24} And when the priest and captain of the temple and chief priests heard these words, they were in doubt of them, what this might be.
{5:25} And a certain one having come near, announced to them, saying, That, behold, the men which ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.
{5:26} Then the commander having gone with attendants, brought them, not with force: for they feared the people, lest they might be stoned.
{5:27} And having brought them, they set in the council: and the chief priest asked them,
{5:28} Saying, Did we not announce to you by order, not to teach by this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and ye desire to bring upon us this man's blood.
{5:29} And Peter having answered, and the sent, said, We must obey God rather than men.
{5:30} The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew with your own hands, having hung him upon a tree.
{5:31} This, God exalted, a Chief and Saviour, with his right hand to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.
{5:32} And we are his witnesses of these words; and the Holy Spirit, whom God gave to them obeying him.
{5:33} And having heard, they gnashed the teeth with rage, and consulted to kill them.
{5:34} And a certain Pharisee having risen up in the council, by name Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honoured by all the people, urged to put the sent without a little while.
{5:35} And he said to them, Men, Israelites, attend to yourselves on account of these men, what ye are about to do.
{5:36} For before these days Theudas arose, saying himself to be somebody: which a number of men followed, about four hundred, who was slain; and all, as many as believed him, were destroyed, and were for nothing.
{5:37} After this Judas the Galilean arose in the days of enrolling, and misled enough people after him: and he perished; and all, as many as believed him, were scattered.
{5:38} And now say I to you, Depart from these men, and leave them; for if this counsel or this work be of men, it shall be destroyed:
{5:39} And if it is of God, ye cannot destroy it; lest ye also be found contenders against God.
{5:40} And by him they were persuaded: and having called the sent, having stripped, they enjoined not to speak in the name of Jesus, and loosed them.
{5:41} Truly therefore they went rejoicing from the face of the council, that for his name they were deemed worthy to be dishonoured.
{5:42} And every day in the temple, and at the house, they ceased not teaching and announcing the good news, Jesus the Christ.
{6:1} And in those days, the disciples multiplying, there was a murmuring of the Greeks against the Hebrews, because their widows were overlooked in the daily service.
{6:2} And the twelve having called the multitude of the disciples, said, It is not pleasing for us, having left the word of God, to serve tables.
{6:3} Therefore, survey, brethren, seven men of you, being witnesses full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom ye shall set over this need.
{6:4} And we will persevere in prayer, and the service of the word.
{6:5} And the word pleased before all the multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:
{6:6} Whom they set before the sent: and having prayed, they put hands upon them.
{6:7} And the word of God increased: and the number of disciples was multiplied greatly in Jerusalem; and a great crowd of priests listened to the faith.
{6:8} And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.
{6:9} And certain of them arose from the synagogue, called Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrian, and of them from Cilicia and Asia, seeking out with Stephen.
{6:10} And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.
{6:11} Then they put under men, saying, That we have heard him speaking defaming words against Moses, and God.
{6:12} And they roused together the people, and elders, and scribes, and having stood against, they seized him, and brought to the council,
{6:13} And set false witnesses, saying, This man ceases not speaking defaming words against this holy place, and the law:
{6:14} For we have heard him saying; That Jesus the Nazarite shall abolish this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered to us.
{6:15} And all they sitting in the council, having looked intently upon him, saw his face as the face of a messenger.
{7:1} And the chief priest said, Hold these things thus?
{7:2} And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye: The God of glory was sent to our father Abraham, being in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,
{7:3} And he said to him, Come out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.
{7:4} Then having come out of the land of the Chaldeans, he dwelt in Charran: and thence, after his father died, he transplanted him into this land, in which ye now dwell.
{7:5} And he gave him none inheritance in it, not a step of the foot: and he promised to give it him for a possession, and to his seed after him, there being no child to him.
{7:6} And God spake thus, That his seed shall be dwelling in a strange land; and it shall subjugate them, and inflict evil four hundred years.
{7:7} And the nation which they serve will I judge, said God: and after these shall they go out, and shall serve me in this place.
{7:8} And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so he begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac Jacob; and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.
{7:9} And the patriarchs having been jealous, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,
{7:10} And took him out of all his pressures, and gave him grace and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and set him leader over Egypt and his whole house.
{7:11} And a famine came upon the whole land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great pressure: and our fathers found no food.
{7:12} And Jacob having beard wheat being in Egypt, sent our fathers first.
{7:13} And in the second time, Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's race was manifest to Pharaoh.
{7:14} And Joseph having sent, called for his father Jacob, and all his kindred, in seventy-five souls.
{7:15} And Jacob went down to Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
{7:16} And they transported him to Sychem and put him in the tomb which Abraham was satisfied with for a price of silver from the sons of Emmor of Sychem.
{7:17} And as the time of the solemn promise drew near, which God aware to Abraham, the people increased and were multiplied in Egypt.
{7:18} Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.
{7:19} He having deceived our race by sophistry, inflicted evil upon our fathers, to make their babes cast out, that they should not breed.
{7:20} In which time Moses was born, and he was shrewd to God, who was nourished up three months in his father's house:
{7:21} And he having been exposed, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for a son to herself.
{7:22} And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was powerful in words and in works.
{7:23} And when the time of forty years was completed to him, it came up upon his heart to take a view of his brethren the sons of Israel.
{7:24} And having seen a certain one injured, he defended, and did vengeance for him harassed, having struck the Egyptian,
{7:25} And he supposed his brethren to understand that God by his hand gives them salvation: and they understood not.
{7:26} And the following day he was seen to those contending, and he compelled them to peace, having said, Men, ye are brethren; wherefore injure ye one another?
{7:27} And he injuring the neighbor repulsed him, having said, Who set thee a ruler and judge over us?
{7:28} Wilt thou not kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian yesterday?
{7:29} And Moses fled at this word, and he was a sojourner in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.
{7:30} And forty years completed, a messenger of the Lord was seen to him in the desert of mount Sina, in a flame of fire in a bramble.
{7:31} And Moses having seen, wondered at the sight: and he coming near to observe attentively, the voice of the Lord was to him,
{7:32} I the God of thy fathers, God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob. And Moses being trembling, dared not observe attentively.
{7:33} And the Lord said to him, Loose the shoes of thy feet: for the place in which thou standest is holy land.
{7:34} Having seen, I saw the injury of my people in Egypt, and I heard their groaning, and came down to take them away. And now came, I will send thee into Egypt.
{7:35} This Moses which they denied, having said, Who set thee ruler and judge? this, God sent, a ruler and redeemer by the hand of the messenger having been seen to him in the bramble.
{7:36} He brought them out, having done wonders and sign in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the desert forty years.
{7:37} This is Moses, having said to the sons of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brethren, like me; him shall ye hear.
{7:38} This is he having been in the church in the desert with the messenger speaking to him in Mount Sina, and our fathers: who received the living oracles to give to us:
{7:39} To whom our fathers would not be obedient, but rejected, and in their hearts they turned back into Egypt,
{7:40} Having said to Aaron, Make us gods who shall go before us: for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has been to him.
{7:41} And they made a calf in those days, and brought up a sacrifice to the image, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.
{7:42} And God turned, and delivered them up to serve the army of heaven; as it has been written in the book of the prophets, Slain victims and sacrifices brought ye not to me forty years in the desert, O house of Israel,
{7:43} And ye took up the tent of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, types which ye made to worship them: and I will transplant you beyond Babylon.
{7:44} The tent of testimony was with our fathers in the desert, as he speaking set to Moses, to make it according to the type which he had seen.
{7:45} Which also our fathers having received brought in with Jesus in the possession of nations, which God drove out from our fathers' face, even to the days of David;
{7:46} Who found grace before God, and asked to find a tent to the God of Jacob.
{7:47} And Solomon built for himself a house.
{7:48} But the Highest dwells not in temples made by hands; as says the prophet,
{7:49} Heaven a throne to me, and earth the footstool of my feet: what house will ye build to me? says the Lord: or what the place of my rest?
{7:50} Did not my hand make all these things?
{7:51} Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers, also you.
{7:52} Which of the prophets did not your fathers drive out and they slew them announcing beforehand of the coming of the Just; of whom ye have now been traitors and murderers:
{7:53} Who have received the law by the regulations of messengers, and ye watched not.
{7:54} And having heard those, they were sawn through their hearts, and they gnashed the teeth upon him.
{7:55} And being full of the Holy Spirit, having looked intently to heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God,
{7:56} And he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.
{7:57} And having cried with a great voice, they held fast their ears, and rushed unanimously upon him,
{7:58} And having cast out of the city, they stoned: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man called Saul.
{7:59} And they stoned Stephen, calling upon, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
{7:60} And having set the knees, he cried with a great voice, Lord, wouldest thou not set this sin to them. And having said this he was set to sleep.
{8:1} And Saul was assenting to his murder. And in that day was a great expulsion upon the church in Jerusalem; and all were scattered up and down in the countries of Judea and Samaria, except the sent.
{8:2} And circumspect men interred Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.
{8:3} And Saul abused the church, going into houses, and drawing out men and women, delivered to prison.
{8:4} Truly therefore the dispersed passed through announcing good news the word.
{8:5} And Philip having come down to the city of Samaria, proclaimed Christ to them.
{8:6} And the crowds unanimously attended to things spoken by Philip, in their hearing and seeing the signs which he did.
{8:7} For of many having unclean spirits, crying with a great voice, they came out: and many affected with palsy, and the lame, were healed.
{8:8} And great joy was in that city.
{8:9} And a certain man, Simon by name, was before in the city using magic, and astonishing the nation of Samaria, saying himself to be somebody great:
{8:10} To whom attended from little to great, saying, This is the great power of God.
{8:11} And they attended to him, because for a sufficient time they were astonished by magics.
{8:12} And when they believed Philip announcing the good news of the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were immersed, both men and women.
{8:13} And Simon also himself believed: and having been immersed, he was persevering with Philip, beholding the signs and great powers having been, they were astonished.
{8:14} And the sent in Jerusalem having heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John:
{8:15} Who, having gone down, prayed for them, that they receive the Holy Spirit.
{8:16} (For not yet was it fallen upon any of them: only they were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.)
{8:17} Then put they hands upon them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
{8:18} And Simon having seen that by putting on of hands of the sent the Holy Spirit is given, he brought money to them,
{8:19} Saying, Give me also this power, that upon whomsoever I put hands, he might receive the Holy Spirit.
{8:20} And Peter said to him, May thy silver be for ruin with thee, for thou thoughtest the gift of God to be purchased for money.
{8:21} No portion is to thee, nor lot, in this word: for thy heart is not upright before God.
{8:22} Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray to God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart be remitted to thee.
{8:23} For I see thee being in the bile of bitterness, and bond of iniquity.
{8:24} And Simon having answered, said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that nothing which ye have spoken come upon me.
{8:25} Truly therefore, they having testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and announced good news to many towns of the Samaritans.
{8:26} And a messenger of the Lord spake to Philip, saying, Arise, and go at noon in the way going down from Jerusalem to Gaza, (this is desert.)
{8:27} And having risen, he went: and, behold, an Ethiopian man, an eunuch of great power of Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come going to worship in Jerusalem,
{8:28} And he was returning, and sitting in his chariot he read the prophet Esaias.
{8:29} And the Spirit said to Philip, Come near, and be joined to this chariot.
{8:30} And Philip running near, heard him reading the prophet Esaias, and he said, Truly knowest thou what thou readest?
{8:31} And he said, How can I, except somebody guide me? And he called upon Philip coming up to sit with him.
{8:32} And the passage of the writing which he read was this, As a sheep for slaughter was he brought; and as a lamb before him shearing it dumb, so he opened not his mouth:
{8:33} In his humiliation was his judgment taken away: and his generation who shall recount? for his life is taken from the earth.
{8:34} And the eunuch having answered Philip, said, I pray thee, of whom speaks the prophet this of himself or of some other?
{8:35} And Philip having opened his mouth, and begun from this writing, announced to him the good news, Jesus.
{8:36} And as they went in the way, they came to some water: and the eunuch said, Behold water; what hinders me to be immersed?
{8:37} And Philip said, If thou believest from the whole heart, it is lawful. And having answered, he said, I believe the Son of God to be Jesus Christ.
{8:38} And he ordered the chariot to stand: and both went down into the Water, both Philip and the eunuch: and he immersed him.
{8:39} And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more: for he went his way rejoicing.
{8:40} And Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he announced the good news to all of the cities, even till he came to Cesarea.
{9:1} And Saul, yet breathing out threatening and murder against the disciples of the Lord, having come to the chief priest,
{9:2} He asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues, so that if he find certain men being of the way, and also women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
{9:3} And in going, it was he drawing near to Damascus: and suddenly a light from heaven flashed with lightning around him:
{9:4} And having fallen upon the earth, he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, Why drivest thou me out?
{9:5} And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom thou drivest out: hard for thee to kick against goads.
{9:6} And he trembling and amazed said, Lord, What wilt thou me to do? And the Lord to him, Arise, and come into the city, and it shall be spoken to thee what thou must do.
{9:7} And the men journeying with him stood astonished, hearing the voice truly, and seeing no one.
{9:8} And Saul was raised up from the earth; and his eyes being opened, he saw no one: and leading him by the hand, they brought him to Damascus.
{9:9} And he was three days not seeing, and he ate not, nor drank.
{9:10} And a certain disciple was in Damascus, Ananias by name; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I, Lord.
{9:11} And the Lord to him, Having risen, go thou to the street called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas Saul by name, of Tarsus; for, behold, he prays,
{9:12} And he saw in a vision a man, by name Ananias, coming in, and having put hand upon him, so that he might look up and see again.
{9:13} And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how many evils he did to thy holy ones in Jerusalem:
{9:14} And here has he authority from the chief priests to bind all those calling on thy name.
{9:15} And the Lord said to him, Go: for he is a vessel of choice to me, to lift up my name before nations, and kings, and the sons of Israel:
{9:16} For I will show him what he must suffer for my name.
{9:17} And Ananias departed, and came into the house; and having put hands upon him said, Brother Saul, the Lord has sent me, Jesus, he seen to thee in the way which thou earnest, so that thou mightest look up, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
{9:18} And quickly there fell from his eyes as scales: and he immediately looked up, and having risen, he was immersed.
{9:19} And having taken food, he was strong. And Saul was in Damascus with the disciples certain days.
{9:20} And quickly in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God.
{9:21} And all they hearing were affected in mind, and said: Is not this he having laid waste in Jerusalem those calling upon this name, and he has come here for this, that he might bring them having been bound to the chief priests?
{9:22} And Saul was the more strengthened, and confounded the Jews dwelling in Damascus, demonstrating that this is the Christ.
{9:23} And when sufficient days were completed, the Jews counselled together to put him to death:
{9:24} But this project was known to Saul. And they observed narrowly the gates day, and also night, that they might kill him.
{9:25} And the disciples having taken him by night, put through the wall, having let down in a wicker basket.
{9:26} And Saul being present in Jerusalem, tried to join himself to the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he is a disciple.
{9:27} And Barnabas having taken him, brought him to the sent, and recounted to them how in the way he saw the Lord, and that he spake to him, and how in Damascus he spake freely in the name of Jesus.
{9:28} And he was with them going in and going out in Jerusalem, and speaking freely in the name of the Lord Jesus.
{9:29} And he spake and sought out with the Greeks; but they purposed to kill him.
{9:30} And the brethren having known, brought him down to Cesarea, and they sent him forth to Tarsus.
{9:31} Then truly the churches through the Whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria, had peace, being built up; and going in the fear of the Lord, and in the consolation of the Holy Spirit, were multiplied.
{9:32} And it was Peter, passing through all, came down also to the holy ones dwelling in Lydda.
{9:33} And he found there a certain man, Eneas by name, lying upon a bed of eight years, who was affected with palsy.
{9:34} And Peter said to him, Eneas, Jesus Christ heals thee; arise, and cover thyself. And he arose quickly.
{9:35} And all dwelling in Lydda and Saron saw him, who turned back to the Lord.
{9:36} And in Joppa was a certain disciple by name Tabitha, which interpreted is called Dorcas: she was full of good works and alms which she did.
{9:37} And it was in those days, having been sick, she died; and having washed, they laid her in an upper room.
{9:38} And Lydda being near Joppa, the disciples having heard that Peter is in it, sent to him two men, beseeching not to hesitate to pass through even to them.
{9:39} And Peter having risen came with them. Whom having approached, they brought into the upper room: and all the widows stood before him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, being with them.
{9:40} And Peter having put them all without, having set the knees, prayed; and having turned back to the body he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and having seen Peter, sat up.
{9:41} And having given her the hand, he raised her up, and having called the holy ones and the widows, he placed her living before them.
{9:42} And it was known through the whole of Joppa: and many believed upon the Lord.
{9:43} And days sufficient he remained in Joppa with a certain Simon, a currier.
{10:1} And a certain man was in Cesarea by name Cornelius, a centurion of the band called Italian,
{10:2} Religious, and fearing God with all his house, and doing many alms to the people, and praying God always.
{10:3} He saw in a vision manifestly about the ninth hour of the day a messenger of God having come in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.
{10:4} And having looked at him intently, and being afraid, he said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thine alms went up for remembrance before God.
{10:5} And now send men to Joppa, and send for Simon, who is called Peter:
{10:6} He is received as guest with a certain Simon a currier, to whom is a house by the sea: he shall speak to thee what thou must do.
{10:7} And when the messenger speaking to Cornelius departed, having called two of his servants, and a religious soldier of those persevering with him;
{10:8} And having related all to them, he sent them to Joppa.
{10:9} And the morrow, these traveling, and drawing near to the city, Peter went up upon the house to pray about the sixth hour:
{10:10} And he was hungry, and would have eaten: and these making ready, a deep trance fell upon him,
{10:11} And he sees heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as a great linen napkin fastened at the four beginnings, and laid down upon the earth:
{10:12} In which were all the quadrupeds of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and the flying things of heaven.
{10:13} And a voice was to him, Having risen, Peter, kill, and eat.
{10:14} And Peter said, By no means, Lord; for never ate I anything common or unclean.
{10:15} And a voice again of a second time to him, What things God cleansed, do not thou make common.
{10:16} And this was for thrice: and again was the vessel taken up into heaven.
{10:17} And as Peter was doubting in himself what the vision might be which he saw, and behold, the man sent from Cornelius having asked for Simon's house, stood at the gate,
{10:18} And having called, they were inquiring if Simon, surnamed Peter, is received there as a guest.
{10:19} And Peter reflecting concerning the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek thee.
{10:20} But thou having risen, come down, and go with them, discussing nothing; for I have sent them.
{10:21} And Peter having come down to the men sent from Cornelius to him, said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what the cause for which ye are present?
{10:22} And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and fearing God, and witnessed of by the whole nation of the Jews, received intimation of the divine will by a holy messenger to send for thee to his house, and hear words of thee.
{10:23} Therefore having called them in, he received as guests. And on the morrow Peter came forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa came with him.
{10:24} And the morrow he came to Cesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and friends by relationship.
{10:25} And it was as Peter came in, Cornelius having met him, having fallen at his feet, worshipped.
{10:26} And Peter raised him up, saying, Arise: I am also myself man.
{10:27} And discoursing with him, he came in, and finds many come together.
{10:28} And he said to them, Ye know that it is violating law for a man a Jew to join himself, or come near to a strange tribe: and God shewed me to call no man common or unclean.
{10:29} And therefore came I without contradiction, having been sent for; therefore I inquire for what word ye sent for me?
{10:30} And Cornelius said, From the fourth day till this hour I was fasting; and the ninth hour praying in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
{10:31} And he says, Cornelius, thy prayer was harkened to, and thine alms remembered before God.
{10:32} Therefore send to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he is received as guest in the house of Simon the currier by the sea: who, being present, shall speak to thee.
{10:33} From this therefore sent I to thee: and thou didst well being present. Now therefore are all we present before God, to hear all commanded thee of God.
{10:34} And Peter having opened the month; said, of a truth I comprehend that God is no respecter of faces!
{10:35} But in every nation he fearing him, and working justice, is acceptable to him.
{10:36} The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, announcing good news, peace through Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all.)
{10:37} The word ye know, having been through the whole of Judea, having begun from Galilee, after the immersion which John preached;
{10:38} Jesus from Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and power; who passed through doing good, and healing all oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.
{10:39} And ye are witnesses of all which he did in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they killed, having hanged upon wood:
{10:40} Him God raised the third day, and gave him to be manifest;
{10:41} Not to all people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead.
{10:42} And he enjoined us to proclaim to the people, and to testify that this is he appointed by God, Judge of the living and the dead.
{10:43} To him all the prophets testify, for all believing on him to receive remission of sins through his name.
{10:44} Peter yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all hearing the word.
{10:45} And believers of the circumcision were affected in mind, as many as came with Peter, that also upon the nations the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out.
{10:46} For they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God. Then answered Peter,
{10:47} Much less can any hinder water, for these not to be immersed, who received the Holy Spirit as also we?
{10:48} And he commanded them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. Then asked they him to remain certain days.
{11:1} And the apostles and brethren, those being in Judea, heard that the nations also received the word of God.
{11:2} And when Peter went up to Jerusalem, they of the circumcision discussed with him,
{11:3} Saying, That thou camest in to men having uncircumcision, and didst eat With them.
{11:4} And Peter having begun, set forth to them in order, saying,
{11:5} I was in the city Joppa, praying: and in a deep trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descending as a great linen napkin, let down from heaven by four beginnings; and it came even to me:
{11:6} Upon which having looked intently, I observed, and saw quadrupeds of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and the flying things of heaven.
{11:7} And I heard a voice saying to me, Having risen, Peter, kill and eat.
{11:8} And I said, By no means, Lord: for anything common or unclean never came into my month.
{11:9} And a voice answered me of a second time from heaven, What God cleansed, profane not.
{11:10} And this was for thrice: and again all was drawn up into heaven.
{11:11} And, behold, from this three men stood at the house in which I was, sent from Cesarea to me.
{11:12} And the spirit said to me to come with them, discussing nothing. And these six brethren came also with me, and we came to the man's house:
{11:13} And he announced to us how he saw a messenger in his house, having stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa, and send for Simon, surnamed Peter.
{11:14} Who shall speak words to thee, by which thou shalt be saved and all thy house.
{11:15} And in my beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as also upon us in the beginning.
{11:16} And I remembered the word of the Lord, when he said, John truly immersed with water; but ye shall be immersed with the Holy Spirit.
{11:17} If therefore God gave the like gift to them as also to us, having believed in the Lord Jesus Christ; how was I able to hinder God.
{11:18} And having heard these, they were silent, and honoured God, saying, For also God gave the nations repentance to life.
{11:19} Therefore truly those dispersed by the pressure having been on account of Stephen, passed through even to Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none except the Jews only.
{11:20} And certain of them were Cyprian and Cyrenian men, who having come to Antioch, spake to the Greeks announcing good news, the Lord Jesus.
{11:21} And the hand of the Lord was with them; and a great number having believed, turned to the Lord.
{11:22} And the word was heard in the ears of the church in Jerusalem concerning them: and they sent Barnabas to pass through even to Antioch.
{11:23} Who, having been present, and seen the grace of God, rejoiced, and besought them all, with purpose of heart, to remain to the Lord.
{11:24} For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and a crowd sufficient were added to the Lord.
{11:25} And Barnabas came forth to Tarsus, to seek Saul.
{11:26} And having found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it was for a whole year they were assembled together in the churches, and taught a sufficient crowd. And the disciples were Christians by divine intimation first in Antioch.
{11:27} In these days came down prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.
{11:28} And one of them having risen, Agabus by name, signified by the Holy Spirit a great famine was about to be upon the whole habitable globe: which was during Claudius Caesar.
{11:29} And certain of the disciples, as he was able, determined, each of them, to send for service to the brethren dwelling in Judea:
{11:30} Which also they did, having sent to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
{12:1} And at that time Herod the king laid hands upon to injure certain of the church.
{12:2} And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
{12:3} And having seen that it is pleasing to the Jews, he added also to take Peter. (They were the days of unleavened bread.)
{12:4} And having seized, he put him in prison, having delivered to four quaternions of soldiers to watch him; wishing after the pascha to bring him to the people.
{12:5} Truly therefore was Peter kept in prison: and prayer was made continually by the church to God for him.
{12:6} And when Herod was about to bring him before, in that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the watch before the door kept the prison.
{12:7} And, behold, the messenger of the Lord stood before, and a light shone in the dwelling: and having struck Peter's side, he raised him up, saying, Arise quickly. And his chains fell off from the hands.
{12:8} And the messenger said to him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy small sandals. And he did so. And he said to him, Put round thy garment, and follow me.
{12:9} And having come out, he followed him; and knew not that it is true that being done by the messenger; and seemed to see a vision.
{12:10} And having passed by the first and second watch, they came to the iron gate leading to the city; which of its free will was opened to them: and having come out, they advanced one street; and quickly the messenger departed from him.
{12:11} And Peter being as himself, said, Now know I truly that the Lord sent his messenger, and took me out of the hands of Herod, and all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
{12:12} And being conscious, he came to the house of Mary mother of John, surnamed Mark; where were sufficient assembled, and praying.
{12:13} And Peter having knocked at the door of the gate, a young girl came near to listen, by name Rhoda.
{12:14} And having known Peter's voice, from joy she opened not the gate, and running, announced Peter to stand before the gate.
{12:15} And they said to her, Thou art mad. And she was strengthened to have it so. And they said, It is his messenger.
{12:16} And Peter continued knocking: and having opened, they saw him, and were moved.
{12:17} And having shaken with the hand at them to be silent, he related to them how the Lord brought him out of prison. And he said, Announce these things to James, and the brethren. And having come out, he went to another place.
{12:18} And it being day, not a little trouble was among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.
{12:19} And Herod having sought him, and not found, having examined the watch, commanded them to be removed. And having come down from Judea to Cesarea, he tarried.
{12:20} And Herod was fighting with violent animosity, with Tyrians and Sidonians: but they came unanimously to him, and having conciliated Blastus, him over the king's bed-chamber, they asked peace; for their country was nourished from the king's.
{12:21} And upon a fixed day, Herod, having put on royal apparel, and having sat upon the judgment seat, harangued them.
{12:22} And the people called aloud, The voice of God, and not of man.
{12:23} And immediately the messenger of the Lord struck him, because he gave not the glory to God: and eaten by worms, he expired.
{12:24} And the word of God increased and multiplied.
{12:25} And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having completed the service, and taken with them John, surnamed Mark.
{13:1} And certain prophets and teachers were in the church being in Antioch; as Barnabas, and Simeon called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
{13:2} And they serving the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate to me Barnabas and Saul to the work which I have called them.
{13:3} Then having fasted and prayed, and put hands upon them, they let go.
{13:4} Therefore these truly, sent forth by the Holy Spirit, came down to Seleucia and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
{13:5} And being in Salamis, they announced the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John a servant.
{13:6} And having passed through the island to Paphos, they found a certain magician, a false prophet, a Jew, the name to him Barjesus:
{13:7} Who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paul, an intelligent man; he having called Barnabas and Saul, sought anxiously to hear the word of God.
{13:8} And Elymas the magician withstood them, (for so was his name interpreted,) seeking to turn the proconsul from the faith.
{13:9} And Saul, (also Paul,) filled with the Holy Spirit, and looking intently upon him, said,
{13:10} O, full of deceit, and all dexterity, son of the devil, enemy of all justice, Wilt thou cease perverting the straight ways of the Lord?
{13:11} And now, behold, the hand of the Lord upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun till the time. And immediately fell upon him mist and darkness; and going about he sought leading by hand.
{13:12} Then the proconsul having seen that done, he believed, being struck with amazement at the teaching of the Lord.
{13:13} And having been brought from Paphos, they about Paul came to Perga of Pamphylia: and John, having departed from them, returned to Jerusalem.
{13:14} And they having passed from Perga, approached Antioch of Pisidia, and having come into the synagogue on the day of the sabbaths, they sat down.
{13:15} And after reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men, brethren, if the word of encouragement is in you to the people, speak.
{13:16} And Paul having risen, and shaken with the hand, said, Men, Israelites, and ye fearing God, hear ye.
{13:17} God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people in sojourning the land of Egypt, and with high arm brought them out of it.
{13:18} And about forty years time he bare them in the desert.
{13:19} And having destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he gave them to inherit this land by lot.
{13:20} And after these, about four hundred and fifty years he gave judges, even to Samuel the prophet.
{13:21} And thence they desired a king; and God gave them Saul, son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, forty years.
{13:22} And having removed him, he raised up to them David for king; to whom also having testified, he said, I found David of Jesse, a man according to my heart, who shall do all my desires.
{13:23} From the seed of this has God according to promise raised up to Israel a Saviour, Jesus:
{13:24} John having proclaimed before the face of his coming the immersion of repentance to all the people of Israel.
{13:25} And as John completed the course, be said, Whom think ye me to be? I am not. But, behold, he comes after me, whose shoes of the feet I am not worthy to loose.
{13:26} Men, brethren, sons of Abraham's race, and those among you fearing God, to you was the word of this salvation sent.
{13:27} For they dwelling in Jerusalem, and their rulers, not having known him, and the voices of the prophets which being read in every sabbath, having judged, they filled up.
{13:28} And having found no cause of death, they desired Pilate to have him slain.
{13:29} And when they finished all things written concerning him, having taken down from the wood, they put in a tomb.
{13:30} And God raised him from the dead:
{13:31} Who was seen for many days to them having come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.
{13:32} And we announce good news to you, the promise made to our fathers,
{13:33} For this has God completed to us, their children, having raised up Jesus; as it has also been written in the second Psalms, Thou art my Son; to day have I begotten thee.
{13:34} And that he raised him from the dead, no more about to return to corruption, so he said, That I will give you the holy, faithful things of David.
{13:35} For also in another, he says, Thou shalt not give thy Holy one to see corruption.
{13:36} For David, truly having served his own generation by the will of God, was set to sleep, and was added to his fathers, and saw corruption:
{13:37} But whom God raised up, he saw no corruption.
{13:38} Be it known therefore to you, men, brethren, that for him remission of sins is announced to you.
{13:39} And from all which ye could not be justified by Moses' law, every one believing in him is justified.
{13:40} See ye, therefore, that that spoken by the prophets come not upon you.
{13:41} See, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, which ye would not believe if any recount to you.
{13:42} And the Jews having gone out of the synagogue, the nations besought to have these words spoken in the sabbath between.
{13:43} And the synagogue having been dissolved, many of the Jews and strangers worshipping, followed Paul and Barnabas: who speaking to them, persuaded them to remain in the grace of God.
{13:44} And the next sabbath nearly all the city was gathered together to hear the word of God.
{13:45} And the Jews, having seen the crowds, were filled with envy, and spake against the things said by Paul, contradicting and defaming.
{13:46} And Paul and Barnabas speaking freely, said, To you was it first necessary for the word of God to be spoken: but since ye reject it, and judge yourselves not worthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the nations.
{13:47} For so has the Lord commanded us, I have set thee for a light of the nations, for thee to be for salvation even to the last of the earth.
{13:48} And the nations having rejoiced, honoured the word of the Lord: and they believed, as many as were drawn out for eternal life.
{13:49} And the word of the Lord was conveyed through the whole country.
{13:50} And the Jews urged on the worshipping and distinguished women, and the first men of the city, and they raised up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and they cast them out of their bounds,
{13:51} And they, having shaken off the cloud of the dust of their feet against them, came into Iconium.
{13:52} And the disciples were filled with joy, and the Holy Spirit.
{14:1} And it was in Iconium according to the same, went they into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude of the Jews and also of Greeks believed.
{14:2} And the unbelieving Jews excited and trained up the souls of the nations against the brethren.
{14:3} Therefore truly they remained a sufficient time speaking freely in the Lord, he testifying to the word of his grace, and giving signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
{14:4} And the multitude of the city was divided: and some truly were with the Jews, and some with the sent.
{14:5} And when there was a violent effort of the nations, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to be insolent, and to stone them,
{14:6} Being conscious, they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the country round about:
{14:7} And there they were announcing the good news.
{14:8} And a certain man in Lystra, not having strength in the feet, sat, being lame from his mother's belly, who had never walked:
{14:9} He having heard Paul speaking, who having looked intently upon him, and seen that he has faith to be cured,
{14:10} Said with a great voice, Stand up upon thy feet upright: And he leaped and walked.
{14:11} And the crowds having seen what Paul did, lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, Gods likened to men came down to us.
{14:12} And truly they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, since he was leader of the word.
{14:13} And Jupiter's priest, being before their city, having brought bulls and crowns to the gates, wished to sacrifice with the crowd.
{14:14} And Barnabas and Paul, the sent, having heard, having rent their garments, rushed in among the crowd, crying out,
{14:15} And saying, Men, why do ye these things? We also are men of similar passions with you, announcing good news to turn you back from these vanities to the living God, who made heaven, and earth, and sea, and all in them:
{14:16} Who in past generations suffered all nations to go in their ways.
{14:17} And surely indeed he left not himself without witness, doing good, having given us rain from heaven, and fruitful times, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
{14:18} And saying these, they scarcely hindered the crowds, not to sacrifice to them.
{14:19} And Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, and stoned Paul, drew out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
{14:20} And the disciples having surrounded him, having risen, he came into the city: and the morrow he came out with Barnabas to Derbe.
{14:21} And having announced that city the good news, and made disciples sufficient, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch,
{14:22} And supporting the souls of the disciples, beseeching to remain in the faith, that through many pressures we must come into the kingdom of God.
{14:23} And having chosen them elders in the church, having prayed with fasting, they set them before the Lord, in whom they had believed.
{14:24} And having passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
{14:25} And having spoken the word in Perga, they came down to Attalia:
{14:26} And thence they sailed away to Antioch, thence were they delivered by the grace of God to the work which they completed.
{14:27} And having arrived, and gathered the church together, they announced what God did with them, and that he opened the door of faith to the nations.
{14:28} And they tarried there not a little time with the disciples.
{15:1} And certain having come down from Judea taught the brethren, That except ye be circumcised by Moses custom, ye cannot be saved.
{15:2} Therefore dissension and no small discussion having been to Paul and Barnabas with them, they arranged for Paul and Barnabas to go up, and certain others of them, to the sent and elders in Jerusalem about this question.
{15:3} Truly therefore the sent by the church passed through Phenice and Samaria, relating the turning back of the nations: and they made great joy to all the brethren.
{15:4} And having arrived at Jerusalem they were received by the church, and the sent and elders, and they announced what God did with them.
{15:5} And certain of them from the sect of the Pharisees having believed, rose up, saying, That they must be circumcised, and to enjoin to keep the law of Moses.
{15:6} And the sent and elders were gathered together to see about this word.
{15:7} And much discussion having been, Peter having risen up, said to them, Men, brethren, ye know that from ancient days God chose among us, through my month for the nations to hear the word of good news, and believe.
{15:8} And God the knower of hearts testified to them, having given them the Holy Spirit, as also us;
{15:9} And separated nothing between us and also them, by faith having purified their hearts.
{15:10} Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
{15:11} But by grace of our Lord Jesus Christ we believe to be saved, as also they.
{15:12} And all the multitude were silent, and heard Barnabas and Paul, recounting what signs and wonders God did in the nations through them.
{15:13} And after they were silent, James answered, saying, Men, brethren, hear me:
{15:14} Simeon related how God first reviewed to take from the nations a people for his name.
{15:15} And with this the words of the prophets agree: as has been written,
{15:16} After these will I return, and rebuild the tent of David, having fallen; and its things undermined will I rebuild, and set it upright:
{15:17} So that they remaining of men might seek out the Lord, and all the nations upon whom my name has been called upon them, says the Lord, making all these.
{15:18} Known to God are all his works from eternity.
{15:19} Wherefore I judge, not to molest them, from the nations turning back to God:
{15:20} But to send to them, to keep off from pollutions of images, and harlotry, and strangulation, and blood.
{15:21} For Moses of ancient generations has them proclaiming him in every city, being read in the synagogues in every sabbath.
{15:22} Then it seemed fitting to the sent and the elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren:
{15:23} Having written by their hand thus; The sent and elders and brethren to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia from the nations, health:
{15:24} Since we heard that certain of us having come out have troubled you with words, destroying your souls, saying, To be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we sent no word:
{15:25} It seemed fitting to us, having been unanimous, to send to you chosen men with our dearly beloved Barnabas and Paul,
{15:26} Men having delivered up their souls for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
{15:27} Therefore have we sent Judas and Silas, and these by the word announcing these things.
{15:28} For it seemed fitting to the Holy Spirit, and to us, for no more burden to be put upon you but the necessities of these;
{15:29} To keep off from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and strangulation, and harlotry: from which keeping yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.
{15:30} Truly therefore having been loosed, they came to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they gave up the epistle:
{15:31} And having read, they rejoiced for the encouraging.
{15:32} And Judas and Silas, they also being prophets, through much speech consoled the brethren, and supported.
{15:33} And having made time, they were loosed with peace from the brethren to the sent.
{15:34} And it seemed fitting to Silas to wait for him.
{15:35} And Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and announcing good news, with many others, the word of the Lord.
{15:36} And after certain days said Paul to Barnabas, Now having turned back, let us review our brethren in every city in which we announced the word of the Lord, how they hold.
{15:37} And Barnabas purposed to take with them John, called Mark.
{15:38} But Paul deemed worthy, having withdrawn from them from Pamphylia, and not having come with them to the work, not to take him with them.
{15:39} Therefore there was an incitement, so that they separated from one another: and Barnabas, having taken Mark, sailed to Cyprus;
{15:40} And Paul, having chosen Silas, went forth, having been delivered to the grace of God by the brethren.
{15:41} And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, supporting the churches.
{16:1} And he arrived at Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, by name Timothy, son of a certain woman, a faithful Jewess; and of a Greek father:
{16:2} Who was testified of by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.
{16:3} Him Paul wished to go forth with him; and having taken, he circumcised him, on account of the Jews being in those places: for all knew his father that he was a Greek.
{16:4} And as they were going through the cities, they delivered them the orders to watch, having been determined by the sent and the elders in Jerusalem.
{16:5} Therefore truly the churches were rendered firm in faith, and abounded in number daily.
{16:6} And having passed through Phrygia and the Galatian country, hindered by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia,
{16:7} Having come to Mysia, they tried to go to Bithynia: and the Spirit suffered them not.
{16:8} And having passed by Mysia they came down to Troas.
{16:9} And a vision was seen to Paul by night; A certain man, a Macedonian, was standing, beseeching him, and saying, Having passed to Macedonia, help us.
{16:10} And when he saw the vision, we quickly sought to come out to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord called us to announce good news to them.
{16:11} Therefore having been conveyed from Troas, we ran straight forward to Samothracia, and the following day to Neapolis;
{16:12} And thence to Philippi, which is the first city of Macedonia, a colony. And we were in that city passing certain days.
{16:13} And the day of the sabbaths we came out of the city by the river, where prayer was customary to be; and having sat down, we spake to the women come together.
{16:14} And a certain woman, by name Lydia, a dealer in purple garments, of the city of Thyatira, worshipping God, heard: whose heart the Lord opened to attend to things spoken by Paul.
{16:15} And when she was immersed, and her house, she besought, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, having come into my house, remain. And she forced us.
{16:16} And it was we going for prayer, a certain young girl having the spirit of Python met us, who furnished much gain to her lords, prophesying:
{16:17} She having followed Paul and us, cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, who announce to us the way of salvation.
{16:18} And this did she for many days. And Paul, having been exercised, and having turned back to the spirit, said, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out the same hour.
{16:19} And her lords having seen that the hope of their gain went out, taking Paul and Silas, they drew to the assembly to the rulers,
{16:20} And having brought them to the generals, they said, These the men who cause disturbance to our city, being Jews,
{16:21} And they announce customs, which it is not lawful for us to receive, nor do, being Romans.
{16:22} And the crowd set together against them: and the generals having rent their garments, commanded to scourge with rods.
{16:23} And many blows having been put upon them, they cast into prison, having commanded the jailor to keep them safely:
{16:24} Who, having received such an order, cast them into the inner prison, and placed their feet firmly in wood.
{16:25} And at midnight Paul and Silas praying, praised God: and the imprisoned heard them.
{16:26} And suddenly was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and the bonds of all were let loose.
{16:27} And the jailor being awakened, and having seen the doors of the prison opened, having drawn a sword, was about to kill himself, supposing the imprisoned to have fled.
{16:28} And Paul called with a great voice, saying, Thou shouldest do no injury to thyself; for we are all here.
{16:29} And having asked for a light, he rushed in, and being trembling, fell before Paul and Silas,
{16:30} And bringing them out, he said, Lords, what must I do that I might be saved.
{16:31} And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.
{16:32} And they spake to him the word of the Lord, and to all in his house.
{16:33} And having taken them in that hour of the night, he washed out the blows; and was immersed, he and all his, immediately.
{16:34} And having brought them up to his house, he set a table before, and rejoiced with the entire household, having believed God.
{16:35} And it being day, the generals sent the bearers of the rod, saying, Loose these men.
{16:36} And the jailor announced these words to Paul, That the generals have sent that ye be loosed: now therefore having come out, go in peace.
{16:37} But Paul said to them, Having stripped us publicly not condemned, being Roman men, they cast into prison and now do they cast us out secretly? not so; but having come themselves, let them bring us out.
{16:38} And the bearer of the rod announced these words to the generals: and they were afraid, having heard that they are Romans.
{16:39} And having come they besought them, and having brought out, they entreated to come out of the city.
{16:40} And having come out of prison, they came to Lydia; and having seen the brethren, they encouraged them, and they came forth.
{17:1} And having passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:
{17:2} And according to custom to Paul, he went in to them, and upon three sabbaths discussed with them from the writings,
{17:3} Opening and setting before, that it was necessary for Christ to suffer, and rise from, the dead; and that this is Christ Jesus, whom I announce to you.
{17:4} And certain of them were persuaded, and were assigned by lot to Paul and Silas; and of worshipping Greeks a great multitude, and not a few of the first women.
{17:5} And the unbelieving Jews, having been jealous, and having taken certain evil men of the vulgar, and excited to tumult, they disturbed the city by loud noise, and having stood against the house of Jason, they sought to bring them to the populace.
{17:6} And not having found them, they drew Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying, That those having subverted the habitable globe, these also are present here;
{17:7} Which Jason has received: and these all do opposite to Caesar's enactments, saying, There is another king, Jesus.
{17:8} And they troubled the crowd and rulers of the city, having heard these.
{17:9} And having taken sufficient of Jason, and the rest, they loosed them.
{17:10} And the brethren quickly sent out both Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who arriving went away to the synagogue of the Jews.
{17:11} And they were of more noble birth than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all willingness, and examined the writings daily, if these things might hold thus.
{17:12} Therefore truly many of them believed; and of the distinguished Grecian women, and of men, not few.
{17:13} And when the Jews from Thessalonica heard that also in Berea the word of God was announced by Paul, they came there also, agitating the crowd.
{17:14} And quickly the brethren sent away Paul to go as by the sea: and both Silas and Timothy remained there.
{17:15} And they conveying Paul brought him even to Athens: and having taken a command to Silas and Timothy that now they might come to him most speedily, they departed.
{17:16} And Paul waiting for them among the Athenians, his spirit was excited in him, seeing the city being addicted to idol worship.
{17:17} Therefore truly he discussed in the synagogue with Jews, and those worshipping, and in the assembly in every day with those being present.
{17:18} And certain of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers deliberated with him. And certain said, What may this idle, talkative man wish to say? and others, He seems to be a declarer of strange demons: because he announced to them good news, and the rising up.
{17:19} And having taken him, they brought upon Mars' hill, saying, Can we know what this new teaching is, spoken by thee?
{17:20} For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we wish therefore to know what these things may be.
{17:21} (And all the Athenians and strangers being present, passed time in nothing else but to say or hear some thing new.)
{17:22} And Paul having stood in the midst of Mars' hill, said, Men, Athenians, I see that in all things ye have a superstitious fear of divinity.
{17:23} For having passed by, and beholding your venerations, I found also an altar upon which was inscribed, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom not knowing therefore ye reverence, him I announce to you.
{17:24} God having made the world and all things in it, he being Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made by hands;
{17:25} Nor is served by men's hands, standing in need of anything, he giving to all life, and breath, and all things.
{17:26} And he made of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth, having limited the times before arranged, and the bounds of their habitation;
{17:27} To seek the Lord, if perchance indeed they have felt for him, and found, although not being far from each one of us:
{17:28} For in him we live, and move, and are; as certain of the composers among you have said, For we also are his race.
{17:29} Being therefore the posterity of God, we ought not to think gold, or silver, or stone, an engraving of art, or meditation of man, the divinity to be like.
{17:30} Therefore truly, God having overlooked the times of ignorance, now announces to all men everywhere to repent:
{17:31} Wherefore he set a day, in which he is about to judge the habitable globe in justice by the man whom he appointed; having offered faith to all, having raised him from the dead.
{17:32} And having heard of the rising up of the dead, they treated with mockery; and said, We will hear thee again concerning this.
{17:33} And so Paul went forth from the midst of them.
{17:34} And certain men having joined him, believed: among whom also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman by name Damaris, and others with them.
{18:1} And after these Paul having departed from Athens, came to Corinth;
{18:2} And having found a certain Jew by name Aquila, a Pontian by birth, having recently come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife; (for Claudius had ordered all Jews to be separated from Rome:) came to them.
{18:3} And because being of the same trade, he remained with them, and wrought: for they were by trade tentmakers.
{18:4} And he discussed in the synagogue on every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.
{18:5} And when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was oppressed in spirit, testifying to the Jews Jesus Christ.
{18:6} And they opposing, and blaspheming, having shaken off the garments violently, he said to them, Your blood upon your head; I clean: from now will I go to the nations.
{18:7} And having gone away thence, he came to the house of a certain Justus by name, worshipping God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue.
{18:8} And Crispus, ruler of the synagogue, believed the Lord with his whole house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptised.
{18:9} And the Lord said through a vision by night to Paul, Fear not, but speak, and thou shouldest not be silent:
{18:10} For I am with thee, and none shall attack thee to injure thee: for much people are to me in this city.
{18:11} And he sat a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
{18:12} And Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews arose unanimously against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,
{18:13} Saying, This one persuades men to worship God against the law.
{18:14} And Paul being about to open the mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If therefore it were truly any injustice or wicked, criminal action, O Jews, against the word, I should have borne with you:
{18:15} But if it is a question of the word, and names, and law, according to you, see ye yourselves; for I will not be judge of these.
{18:16} And he drave them away from the judgment seat.
{18:17} And all the Greeks having taken Sosthenes, ruler of the synagogue, beat before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of these.
{18:18} And Paul yet having remained sufficient days, having taken leave of the brethren, sailed out to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn the head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.
{18:19} And Paul arrived at Ephesus, and left those of his: and he having come into the synagogue, discussed with the Jews.
{18:20} And they asking to remain with them for more time, he acquiesced not;
{18:21} But he took leave of them, saying, I must at any rate do the coming festival in Jerusalem: and I will again return to you, God willing. And he was conveyed from Ephesus.
{18:22} And having come down to Cesarea having gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch.
{18:23} And having made a certain time, he came out, passing in order the Galatian country and Phrygia, supporting all the disciples.
{18:24} And a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, arrived at Ephesus, being able in the writings.
{18:25} He was instructed in the way of the Lord; and boiling up in the spirit, he spake and taught attentively the things of the Lord, knowing only the immersion of John.
{18:26} And he began to speak freely in the synagogue: and Priscilla and Aquila having heard him, took him, and set forth to him the way of God more accurately.
{18:27} And he wishing to pass through to Achaia, the brethren having encouraged, wrote to the disciples to receive him: who having arrived, profited much them having believed through grace:
{18:28} For he mightily refuted the Jews publicly, shewing by the writings Jesus to be Christ.
{19:1} And it was in Apollos' being in Corinth, Paul having passed through the higher parts, came to Ephesus: and having found certain disciples,
{19:2} He said to them, Having believed, have ye received the Holy Spirit? And they said to him, But neither heard we if there be a Holy Spirit.
{19:3} And he said to them, Into what then were ye immersed? And they said, Into John's immersion.
{19:4} And Paul said, John truly immersed the immersion of repentance, saying to the people, that they should believe on him coming after him, that is, in Christ Jesus.
{19:5} And they having heard, were immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus.
{19:6} And Paul having laid hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came upon them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
{19:7} And all the men were about twelve.
{19:8} And having come into the synagogue, he spake freely, discoursing for three months, and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.
{19:9} And when certain were hardened, and believed not, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, having departed from them, he separated the disciples, discoursing in the day in the school of a certain Tyrannus.
{19:10} And this was for two years: so that all dwelling in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
{19:11} And God did special powers by Paul's hands:
{19:12} So that also upon the sick were brought from his body napkins or aprons, and diseases were removed from them, and evil spirits came out of them.
{19:13} And certain of the wandering Jews, exorcists, undertook to call over them having evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims.
{19:14} And there were certain sons of Sceva, a Jew, chief priest, seven doing this.
{19:15} And the evil spirit having answered, said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?
{19:16} And the man leaping upon them in whom the evil spirit was, and having overpowered them, he was strong against them, so that naked and wounded they fled out of the house.
{19:17} And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
{19:18} And many of them having believed came, acknowledging and proclaiming their deeds.
{19:19} And sufficient of them having done unnecessary things, having brought books together, burned before all: and computed their prices, and found fifty thousand of silver.
{19:20} Thus with might the word of the Lord increased, and was strong.
{19:21} And when these were completed, Paul proposed in spirit, having passed through Macedonia and Achaia to go to Jerusalem, saying, That after have been there, I must also see Rome.
{19:22} And having sent into Macedonia two of them serving him, Timothy, and Erastus, he stopped a season in Asia.
{19:23} And in that time was there no little trouble about the way.
{19:24} For a certain Demetrius by name, a silversmith, making the silver temples of Diana, furnished no little work to artificers;
{19:25} Whom having collected together and the workmen of such things, he said, Men, ye know that out of this work is our good food.
{19:26} And ye see and hear that not only Ephesus, but almost all Asia, this Paul having persuaded, changed a sufficient crowd, saying, that they are not gods made by hands:
{19:27} And not only this part is in danger to us to come to reproach; but also the temple of the great goddess Diana to be reckoned for nothing, and her greatness also about to be destroyed, whom the whole of Asia and the habitable globe worship.
{19:28} And having heard, and been filled with wrath, they cried, saying, Great the Diana of the Ephesians.
{19:29} And the whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed unanimously into the theatre, having taken away together Gains and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul's companions of the journey.
{19:30} And Paul wishing to come in to the people, the disciples suffered him not.
{19:31} And certain also of the chief of Asia, being friends to him, having sent to him, besought not to give himself into the theatre.
{19:32} Others truly cried some other things: for the church was confused; and the most knew not for what they had come together.
{19:33} And they forced Alexander out of the crowd, the Jews having put him forward. And Alexander having shaken the hand, wished to justify himself to the people.
{19:34} And having known that he is a Jew, there was one voice from all crying for about two hours, Great the Diana of the Ephesians.
{19:35} And the scribe having calmed the crowd, says, Men, Ephesians, for who is the man that knows not the city of the Ephesians, being temple keeper of the great goddess Diana, and sent by Jove?
{19:36} Therefore these things not being refuted, it is necessary for you to be restrained, and to do nothing rash.
{19:37} For ye brought these men not sacrilegious, nor blaspheming your goddess.
{19:38} If truly therefore Demetrius, and the artificers with him, have a word against any, the court days are kept, and there are proconsuls; let them prosecute one another.
{19:39} But if ye inquire anything concerning, other things, it shall be explained in a lawful assembly.
{19:40} For we are also in danger to be called in question for this day, being no cause for which we shall be able to give back word of this confederation.
{19:41} And having said these, he loosed the assembly.
{20:1} And after the uproar was ceased, Paul having called the disciples, and greeted, he came out to go into Macedonia.
{20:2} And having passed through those parts, and having besought them by much speech, he came into Greece.
{20:3} And having made three months; an insidious plot having been for him by the Jews, being about to sail to Syria, there was a purpose to return through Macedonia.
{20:4} And there agreed with him as far as Asia Sopater a Berean; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus: and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.
{20:5} These having come before awaited us in Troas.
{20:6} And we sailed forth after the days of unleavened from Philippi, and came to them in Troas up to five days; where we tarried seven days.
{20:7} And in one of the sabbaths, the disciples having been assembled together to break bread, Paul conversed with them being about to go forth the morrow; and he continued the word until midnight.
{20:8} And sufficient lights were in the upper room, where they were assembled.
{20:9} And a certain young man by name Eutychus, sitting in the window, borne down by deep sleep, Paul conversing more and more, fell down below from the third story, and was taken up dead.
{20:10} And Paul having gone down, fell upon him, and embracing, said, Be not disturbed, for his soul is in him.
{20:11} And having gone up, and broken bread, and tasted, and conversed for a sufficient time, till the light, so he went forth.
{20:12} And they brought the child living, and were not little comforted.
{20:13} And we having gone before to the ship, sailed to Assos, there being about to take up Paul: for so had he ordered, being about himself to go on foot.
{20:14} And when he joined us at Assos, having taken him up, we came to Mitylene.
{20:15} And from thence having sailed away, the following day we arrived over against Chios; and the other day we approached to Samos, and having remained in Trogyllium, the following day we came to Miletus.
{20:16} For Paul determined to sail to Ephesus, as it might not be to him to spend the time in Asia: for he hastened, if it were possible to him, to be in Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
{20:17} And having sent from Miletus to Ephesus, he called for the elders of the church.
{20:18} And when they came to him, he said to them, Ye know, from the first day in which I embarked for Asia, how I was with you all the time.
{20:19} Serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears, and temptations, having happened to me by the insidious plots of the Jews:
{20:20} How I concealed nothing of things profitable, not to announce to you, and teach you publicly, and in the houses,
{20:21} Testifying to both Jews, and Greeks, repentance towards God, and the faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.
{20:22} And now, behold, I, bound in the spirit, am going to Jerusalem, not knowing the things going to happen to me in it;
{20:23} But that the Holy Spirit testifies in the city, saying that bonds and pressures await me.
{20:24} But the word of none do I make mine own, neither have I my soul highly prized to myself, in order to finish my course with joy, and the service which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the good news of the grace of God.
{20:25} And now, behold, I know that all ye shall see my face no more, among whom I passed through, proclaiming the kingdom of God.
{20:26} Wherefore I testify to you in this day, that I pure from the blood of all.
{20:27} For I concealed not to announce to you all the counsel of God.
{20:28} Attend therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit set you inspectors, to feed the church of God, which he acquired by his own blood.
{20:29} For I know this, that there shall come in after my departure grievous wolves to you, not sparing the flock.
{20:30} And of yourselves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to tear away disciples after them.
{20:31} Wherefore watch ye, remembering that the space of three years night and day I ceased not reminding each one with tears.
{20:32} And now I commit you, brethren, to God, and to the word of his grace, being able to build up, and give you inheritance among all the consecrated.
{20:33} Silver or gold, or clothing, of none have I eagerly desired.
{20:34} And ye yourselves know, that to my necessities, and to those being with me, these hands served.
{20:35} I shewed you all things, that so being wearied ye must support the weak, and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that himself said, It is happy to give rather than receive.
{20:36} And having said these, having placed his knees, he prayed with them all.
{20:37} And much weeping was from all; and having fallen upon Paul's neck, they kissed him,
{20:38} Grieving chiefly for the word which he spake, that they are about to see his face no more. And they sent him forward to the ship.
{21:1} And it was, as we were conducted forth, torn asunder from them, having run straight forward, we came to Coos, and in continuation to Rhodes, and thence to Patara:
{21:2} And having found a ship passing over to Phenicia, having embarked, we were conducted forth.
{21:3} And having been shown Cyprus, and left it at the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and were conveyed to Tyre: for thither was the ship discharging the lading.
{21:4} And having found disciples, we remained there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem.
{21:5} And it was when we accomplished the days, having come out we went; all sending us forward, with wives and children, even to without the city: and having placed the knees upon the seashore, we prayed.
{21:6} And having greeted one another, we embarked in the ship; and these returned to their own.
{21:7} And we having finished the voyage from Tyre, arrived at Ptolemais, and having greeted the brethren, we remained one day with them.
{21:8} And the morrow, they about Paul having come out, came to Cesarea: and having come to Philip's house, bearer of good news, being of the seven, we remained with him.
{21:9} And to him were four daughters, virgins, prophesying.
{21:10} And we remaining many days, a certain prophet came down from Judea, by name Agabus.
{21:11} And having come to us, and lifted up Paul's girdle, and bound his hands and feet, he said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, The man whose is this girdle, shall the Jews so bind in Jerusalem, and they shall deliver him into the hands of the nations.
{21:12} And when we heard these things, both we, and the nations, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
{21:13} And Paul answered, What do ye weeping and breaking my heart? for I not only to be bound, but to die at Jerusalem, have prepared for the name of the Lord Jesus.
{21:14} And he not being persuaded, we were silent, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
{21:15} And after these days, having packed up, we went up to Jerusalem.
{21:16} And there came also with us of disciples from Cesarea, bringing with whom we should be received as guests to a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an ancient disciple.
{21:17} And we having come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
{21:18} And the following day Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.
{21:19} And having greeted them, he recounted to each one what things God had done among the nations through his service.
{21:20} And they having heard, honoured the Lord, and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many ten thousands of Jews there are having believed: and all are zealous of the law:
{21:21} And they were taught about thee, that thou teachest apostasy from Moses, all the Jews among the nations, saying, they are not to circumcise children, nor walk in the customs.
{21:22} What is it therefore? the multitude must all come together: for they will hear that thou hast come.
{21:23} Therefore do this which we say to thee: Four men are to us having a vow upon them;
{21:24} Having taken these, be purified with them, and expend upon them, that they might shave the head: and all might know that what they are taught about thee is nothing; but thou proceedest in regular order, also thyself watching the law.
{21:25} And of the nations having believed, we have written having judged them to keep nothing such, except to watch themselves from that sacrificed to idols, and blood, and strangulation, and harlotry.
{21:26} Then Paul having taken the men, in the following day having been purified with them, went into the temple, announcing the completion of the days of purification, till an offering be brought for each one of them.
{21:27} And when the seven days were about completed, the Jews from Asia, having seen him in the temple, embroiled all the crowd, and put hands upon them,
{21:28} Crying out, Men, Israelites, help: This is the man, teaching all, everywhere, against the people, and the law, and this place: and yet also brought the Greeks into the temple, and has polluted this holy place.
{21:29} (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian whom they thought that Paul had brought into the temple.)
{21:30} And the whole city was moved, and there was a concourse of the people: and having taken up Paul, they drew him out of the temple: and quickly the doors were shut.
{21:31} And seeking to kill him, a rumor went up to the captain of a thousand of the band, that the whole of Jerusalem had been embroiled.
{21:32} Who having taken out of it the soldiers and centurions, he ran down to them: and they having seen the captain of a thousand and the soldiers, ceased striking Paul.
{21:33} Then the captain of a thousand, having drawn near, took him, and commanded to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he might be, and what he had done.
{21:34} And other cried what other in the crowd: and not being able to know certainly for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the camp.
{21:35} And when he was upon the steps, it happened, he was borne by the soldiers for the violence of the crowd.
{21:36} For the multitude of the people followed, crying, Take him away.
{21:37} And being about to be brought into the camp, Paul says to the captain of a thousand, Is it lawful for me to speak anything to thee? and he said, Hast thou knowledge in Greek?
{21:38} Art not thou then the Egyptian, who before these days having risen up, and having brought into the desert four thousand men of murderers?
{21:39} And Paul said, I am truly a man a Jew, a Tarsean of Cilicia, a citizen of no undistinguished city: and I beseech of thee to give way for me to speak to the people.
{21:40} And having given way, Paul standing upon the steps, shook with the hand to the people. And being much silence, he spake in the Hebrew dialect, saying,
{22:1} Men, brethren, and fathers, hear my defence to you.
{22:2} (And having heard that he spake to them in Hebrew dialect, they held more silence: and he says,)
{22:3} I am truly a Jew, a man born in Tarsus, of Cilicia, and brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the exactness of the fathers' law, being zealous of God, as all ye are this day.
{22:4} Who drove out this way even to death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women.
{22:5} As also the chief priest testifies of me, and all the council of elders: and whose letters to the brethren having received, I went to Damascus, going to bring there the bound to Jerusalem, that they might be punished.
{22:6} And it was to me going, and drawing near to Damascus about noon, suddenly much light from heaven flashed around me,
{22:7} And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice, Saul, Saul, why drivest thou me out?
{22:8} And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarite, whom thou drivest out.
{22:9} And they being with me truly saw the light, and were terrified; but they heard not the voice of him speaking to me.
{22:10} And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Having risen, go to Damascus; and there shall be told thee of all which has been arranged for thee to do.
{22:11} And when I saw not from the glory of that light, led by the hand of them being with me I came to Damascus.
{22:12} And a certain Ananias, a religious man according to the law, testified of by all the Jews dwelling,
{22:13} Having come to me, and stood, said to me, Brother Saul, look up. And the same hour I looked up to him.
{22:14} And he said, The God of our fathers took thee in hand, to know his will, and to see the Just, and hear the voice from his mouth.
{22:15} For thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what thou hast seen and hast heard.
{22:16} And now what art thou about to do having risen, be immersed and wash away thy sins, having called upon the name of the Lord.
{22:17} And it was to me returning to Jerusalem, and praying in the temple, I was in a deep trance:
{22:18} And saw him saying to me, Hasten, and come quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony of me.
{22:19} And I said, Lord, these know that I was imprisoning and skinning in the synagogues them believing on thee:
{22:20} And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I myself was standing by, and assenting to his murder, and watching the garments of them murdering him.
{22:21} And he said to me, Go: for I will send thee far off to the nations.
{22:22} And they heard him to this word, and lifted up their voices, saying, Take away such a one from the earth: for it is not suitable for him to live.
{22:23} And they vociferating, and casting garments away, and throwing a cloud of dust into the air,
{22:24} The captain of a thousand commanded him to be brought to the camp, having spoken to examine him by scourges; that he might know for what cause they exclaimed so against him.
{22:25} And as he held him before with thongs, Paul said to the centurion standing by, Is it lawful to scourge a man a Roman, and uncondemned?
{22:26} And the centurion having heard, having come near announced to the captain of a thousand, See what thou art about to do: for this man is a Roman.
{22:27} And the captain of a thousand having come near, said to him, Tell me if thou art a Roman. And he said, Yes.
{22:28} And the captain of a thousand answered, I obtained this citizenship for much capital. And Paul said, And I have been born.
{22:29} Then quickly they about to examine him withdrew from him: and the captain of a thousand was afraid, knowing that he is a Roman, and because he had bound him.
{22:30} And on the morrow, wishing to know the certainty that why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him from bonds, and commanded the chief priests and the whole of their council to come, and having brought down Paul, he set him among them.
{23:1} And Paul, having looked intently to the council, said, Men, brethren, I have lived as a citizen in all good conscience to God till this day.
{23:2} And the chief priest Ananias commanded those standing by him to strike his month.
{23:3} Then said Paul to him, God is about to strike thee, thou wall covered with dust: and sittest thou judging me according to law, and commanded me to be struck illegally?
{23:4} And they standing by said, Revilest thou God's chief priest?
{23:5} And Paul said, I knew not, brethren, that he is chief priest: for it has been written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
{23:6} And Paul having known that one part is of the Sadducees, and the other of the Pharisees, cried in the council, Men, brethren, I am a Pharisee, son of a Pharisee: for the hope and rising up of the dead am I judged.
{23:7} And he having spoken this, there was a dissension of the Pharisees and Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.
{23:8} For truly the Sadducees say there is no rising up, neither messenger, nor spirit: and the Pharisees acknowledge both.
{23:9} And there was a great cry: and the scribes of the Pharisees' part, having risen, struggled with obstinacy, saying, We find nothing evil in this man: but if a spirit or messenger spake to him, we should not contend against God.
{23:10} And there being much dissension, the captain of a thousand, having dreaded lest Paul be torn asunder by them, commanded the army, having gone down, to snatch him from the midst of them, and bring into the camp.
{23:11} And the following night the Lord, having stood by him, said, Take courage, Paul: for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou also testify at Rome.
{23:12} And it being day, certain of the Jews having made a condition, anathematized themselves, saying, neither to eat or drink till they kill Paul.
{23:13} And there were more than forty having made this conspiracy.
{23:14} Who having come to the chief priests and elders, said, By an anathema, we anathematized ourselves, to taste of nothing till we kill Paul.
{23:15} Now therefore do ye exhibit to the captain of a thousand, with the council, so that to-morrow he might bring him down to you, as about to examine more accurately the things concerning him: and we, before he draws near, are ready to kill him.
{23:16} And Paul's sister's son having heard of the ambuscade, having approached, and come into the camp, announced to Paul.
{23:17} And Paul having called one of the centurions, said, Bring this young man to the captain of a thousand; for he has something to announce to him.
{23:18} Then truly having taken him, he brought to the captain of a thousand, and says, Paul, the bound, having called me, asked to bring this young man to thee, having something to say to thee.
{23:19} The captain of a thousand, having taken his hand, and having withdrawn in private, inquired, What is it which thou hast to announce to me?
{23:20} And he said, That the Jews agreed together to ask thee, so that to-morrow thou mightest bring down Paul to the council, as about to inquire something more accurately about him.
{23:21} Therefore thou shouldest not be persuaded by them: for more than forty men of them lie in wait for him, who anathematized themselves, neither to eat or drink till they should kill him: and now are they prepared, expecting a promise from thee.
{23:22} Truly then the captain of a thousand discharged the young man, having enjoined him, Tell none that thou hast shown these things to me.
{23:23} And having called two certain of the centurions, he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers, so that they go to Cesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred having held spears in the right hand, at the third hour of the night;
{23:24} And to bring forward cattle to set Paul upon, that they might carry through safely to Felix the leader.
{23:25} Having written a letter containing this type.
{23:26} Claudius Lysias to the most excellent leader Felix, health.
{23:27} This man having been taken by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them: having stood with an army, I took him away, having learned that he is a Roman.
{23:28} And wishing to know the cause for which they accused him, I brought him down to this council:
{23:29} Whom I found accused of questions of their law, and having no accusation worthy of death or of bonds.
{23:30} And the plot about to be by the Jews, having been made known to me against the man, for this I sent to thee, having also commanded the accusers to say things against him to thee. Farewell.
{23:31} Then truly the soldiers according to that appointed them, having taken up Paul, brought by night to Antipatris.
{23:32} And the morrow; having suffered the horsemen to go with him, they returned to the camp:
{23:33} Who having come into Cesarea and given up the letter to the leader, they also placed Paul before him.
{23:34} And the leader having read, and asked of what province he is, and having understood from Cilicia;
{23:35} I will hearken to thee, he said, when also thine accusers should be present. And he commanded him to be watched in Herod's pretorium.
{24:1} And after five days the chief priest Ananias came down with the elders, and a certain orator, Tertullus, who exhibited to the leader against Paul.
{24:2} And he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse, saying,
{24:3} Attaining much peace by thee, and good actions being to this nation by thy foresight altogether and everywhere, we accept, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
{24:4} And that I hinder thee no more, I beseech thee to hear us concisely by thy clemency.
{24:5} For having found this man a scourge, and moving sedition to all Jews in the habitable globe, and standing in the first rank of the sect of Nazarites:
{24:6} And who attempted to profane the temple: whom we also seized, and wished to judge according to our law.
{24:7} And Lysias the captain of a thousand, having come with much force, carried away out of our hands,
{24:8} Having commanded his accusers to come to thee: by which thou thyself shalt be able, having examined, to know of all these of which we accuse him.
{24:9} And the Jews also agreed, saying, these things hold so.
{24:10} And Paul answered, the leader having nodded to him to speak, Knowing from many years thee being judge to this nation, more cheerfully do I justify things concerning myself:
{24:11} Thou being able to know that not more than twelve days are to me from which I went up, going to worship in Jerusalem.
{24:12} And neither in the temple found they me discussing with any, or making a revolt of the crowd, neither in synagogues, nor in the city:
{24:13} Nor can they bring me forward for things they now accuse me.
{24:14} And this I confess to thee, that according to the way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of the fathers, believing all things written in the law and the prophets:
{24:15} Having hope to God, which they themselves also admit, a rising from the dead about to be, both of just and unjust.
{24:16} And in this I myself attend carefully, to have a conscience unhurt towards God and men always.
{24:17} And after many years I was present, going to do alms to my nation, and offerings.
{24:18} In which they found me purified in the temple, not with the crowd, nor with uproar, and certain Jews from Asia.
{24:19} Who ought to be present to thee, and accuse, if they have anything against me.
{24:20} Or let these themselves say, if they found any injustice in me, I having stood before the council,
{24:21} Or of this one voice, which I cried standing with them, That of the rising up of the dead I am judged this day by you.
{24:22} And having heard these, Felix deferred them, knowing more accurately the things of the way, having said, When Lysias captain of a thousand shall come down, I will examine narrowly things concerning you.
{24:23} And having appointed a centurion to keep Paul, and to have a setting at liberty, and to hinder none of his own to serve or come to him.
{24:24} And after certain days, Felix, having been present with Drusilla his wife, being a Jewess, sent for Paul and heard him of the faith in Christ.
{24:25} And he discoursing of justice, and temperance, and judgment about to be, Felix being terrified, answered, Having now, go; having taken time, I will recall thee.
{24:26} And at the same time also hoping that money should be given him by Paul, so that he might loose him: wherefore also sending for him more frequently, he conversed with him.
{24:27} And two years completed, Felix took Porcius Festus, a successor: and wishing to render a favor to the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.
{25:1} Festus therefore having come to the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Cesarea.
{25:2} And the chief priest and first of the Jews exhibited to him against Paul, and besought him,
{25:3} Asking favor against him, that he might send for him to Jerusalem, making an ambuscade to kill him in the way.
{25:4} Then truly answered Festus, Paul to be kept in Cesarea, and himself quickly about to go forth.
{25:5} Therefore the able among you, he says, having gone down together, if there be anything in this man, let them accuse him.
{25:6} And having tarried with them more than ten days, having gone down to Cesarea, on the morrow, having sat upon the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.
{25:7} And he having come, the Jews having come down from Jerusalem stood round about, bringing many and heavy charges against Paul, which they could not prove.
{25:8} He justifying himself, That neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I sinned any thing.
{25:9} And Festus, wishing to render a favor to the Jews, having answered Paul, said, Wilt thou, having gone up to Jerusalem, there be judged by me of these things?
{25:10} And Paul said, At Caesar's judgment seat am I standing where I must he judged: I injured the Jews nothing, as thou also knowest better.
{25:11} For if truly I act with injustice, and have done anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be nothing of which these accuse me, no one can yield me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.
{25:12} Then Festus, having conversed with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed to Caesar, to Caesar shalt thou go.
{25:13} And certain days having intervened, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Cesarea, having saluted Festus.
{25:14} And as they tarried there many days, Festus set up to the king the things of Paul, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:
{25:15} About whom, I being at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews exhibited, asking judgment against him.
{25:16} To whom I answered, That it is not the custom to Romans to yield up any man to destruction, before that the accused may have the accusers before the face, and take place for defence for the accusation.
{25:17} Therefore, they having come here together, having made no delay, in order having sat upon the judgment seat, I commanded the man to be brought.
{25:18} About whom the accusers, having stood up, brought no charge of what I supposed:
{25:19} But had certain questions of their own superstition against him, and of a certain Jesus, having died, whom Paul declared living.
{25:20} And I doubting at the question concerting this, said, If he be willing to go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things.
{25:21} And Paul having appealed for him to be kept for the determination of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I send him to Caesar.
{25:22} And Agrippa said to Festus, I wished myself also to hear the man. And he said, Tomorrow thou shalt hear him.
{25:23} Therefore the morrow, Agrippa having come, and Bernice, with much display, and having come into the hall, also with captains of thousands, and men of the city being in eminence, and Festus having commanded, Paul was brought.
{25:24} And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men being present with us, ye behold this, of whom all the multitude of Jews addressed me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out he must no more live.
{25:25} And I discovering nothing he has done worthy of death, and he also himself having appealed to Augustus, I judged to send him.
{25:26} Of whom I have not anything certain to write to the lord. Wherefore I brought him to you, and especially to thee, king Agrippa, so that, examination having been, I should have some thing to write.
{25:27} For it seems to me unreasonable sending one in bonds, and not to signify the charges against him.
{26:1} And Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself. Then Paul defended himself, having stretched out the hand:
{26:2} Concerning all of which I am accused by the Jews, king Agrippa, I deem myself happy, being about to defend myself to thee this day:
{26:3} Especially thee being judge of all the customs among the Jews, and also of the questions: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
{26:4} Therefore truly my manner of life from youth, having been from the beginning in my nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews know:
{26:5} Knowing me beforehand, from a former period, if they would testify, that according to the most strict sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.
{26:6} And now in the hope of the solemn promise having been made to the fathers by God, I stand, being judged,
{26:7} To which our twelve tribes, serving night and day, hope to arrive. For which hope I am accused, king Agrippa, by the Jews.
{26:8} Why is it judged incredible by you, if God raise the dead?
{26:9} I therefore truly thought to myself, I must do many things contrary to the name of Jesus, the Nazarite.
{26:10} Which I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the holy ones I shut up in prison, having received authority from chief priests; and they taken up, I carried down a vote.
{26:11} And in all the synagogues, many times punishing them, I compelled to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged against them, I drove out even also to cities without.
{26:12} In which also going to Damascus with authority, and superintendence from the chief priests,
{26:13} The middle of day, I saw in the way, O king, a light from heaven, above the brilliancy of the sun, having shone around me, and those going with me.
{26:14} And we having all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why drivest thou me out? hard for thee to kick against goads.
{26:15} And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou drivest out.
{26:16} But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for, for this was I sent to thee, to take thee in hand, a servant and witness both of what things thou sawest, and of what I shall be seen to thee;
{26:17} Taking thee away from people, and nations, to whom I now send thee.
{26:18} To open their eyes, to turn them back from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, fur them to receive remission of sins, and inheritance with the consecrated by faith in me.
{26:19} Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:
{26:20} But to them in Damascus first, and Jerusalem, and all the country of Judea, and to the nations, announcing to change the mind, and to turn back to God, doing works worthy of change of mind.
{26:21} For these things, me the Jews, having seized in the temple, attempted to kill with their own hands.
{26:22} Therefore having obtained assistance from God, till this day do I stand, testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what both the prophets and Moses spake being about to be:
{26:23} That Christ exposed to suffering, that first from the rising of the dead, he is about to announce light to the people, and nations.
{26:24} And he defending himself by these, Festus said with a great voice, Thou art frenzied, Paul; many letters turn thee to madness.
{26:25} And he says, I am not frenzied, most excellent Festus; but I speak the words of truth and soundness of mind.
{26:26} For the king knows of these, to whom speaking freely I speak: for I am persuaded that none of these are unknown to him; for these were not done in a corner.
{26:27} Believest thou the prophets, king Agrippa? I know that thou believest.
{26:28} And Agrippa said to Paul, In a little thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
{26:29} And Paul said, I would pray to God also in little, and in much, not only thee, but also all hearing me this day to become such, of what kind I also am, besides these bonds.
{26:30} And he having said these, the king arose, and the leader, and Bernice, and they sitting with them:
{26:31} And having withdrawn, they spake to one another, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
{26:32} And Agrippa said to Festus, This man could have been loosed, if he had not appealed to Caesar.
{27:1} And when it was determined for us to sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and certain others bound to a centurion named Julius, of Augustus' band.
{27:2} And having embarked in a ship of Adramyttium, being about to navigate places in Asia, we were conveyed; Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
{27:3} And another day we were brought down to Sidon. And Julius having treated Paul affectionately, gave him up, having gone to his friends to obtain care.
{27:4} And conveyed from thence, we sailed to Cyprus, for the winds were contrary.
{27:5} And having sailed over the sea by Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down to Myra, of Lycia.
{27:6} And there the centurion having found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, placed us upon it.
{27:7} And in many days sailing slowly, and with difficulty having come to Cnidus, the wind not permitting us, we sailed under Crete, to Salmone;
{27:8} And, with difficulty sailing by it, we came to a certain place called The fair havens; to which the city Lasea was near.
{27:9} And a suitable time having intervened, and sailing being already dangerous, for the fast had already passed by, Paul advised,
{27:10} Saying to them, Men, I see that with violence and much damage, not only of the cargo and ship, but also of our lives, the voyage is about to be.
{27:11} But the centurion was rather persuaded by the pilot and the shipmaster, than by the things spoken by Paul.
{27:12} And the harbor being not suitable for passing the winter, the greater part took counsel to be conveyed from thence, if perhaps having arrived at Phenice, they may be able to pass the winter; a harbor of Crete, looking to the south west and to the country.
{27:13} And the south wind having blown softly, having thought to have obtained the purpose, hoisting up near, they sailed by Crete.
{27:14} And after not much a violent wind struck against it, called Enroclydon.
{27:15} And the ship having been caught, and not able to resist the wind, yielding we were carried away.
{27:16} And having run under a certain island called Clauda, with difficulty were we able to be commanding the boat:
{27:17} Which having taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship: and fearing lest they might fall through into the quicksand, having loosened the vessel, so were they borne away.
{27:18} And we being exceedingly tempest tossed, the following day they made a casting of the cargo overboard;
{27:19} And the third, working with our bands, we cast out the rigging of the ship.
{27:20} And neither sun nor stars appearing for many days, and no small tempest impending, finally all hope for us to be saved was removed.
{27:21} And there being much abstinence from food, then Paul having stood in the midst of them, said, Truly it was fitting, O men, having obeyed me, not to be conveyed from Crete, and gain this violence and damage.
{27:22} And now I advise you to be cheerful: for there shall be no throwing away of soul from you, but of the ship.
{27:23} For the messenger of God stood by me in this night, whose I am, and whom I serve,
{27:24} Saying, Fear not, Paul; Thou must stand before Caesar: and, behold, God has bestowed on thee as a gift all these sailing with thee.
{27:25} Wherefore, O men, be cheerful: for I believe God, that so it shall be as he has spoken to me.
{27:26} But we must fall upon a certain island.
{27:27} And when it was the fourteenth night, we being carried up and down in Adria, at midnight the sailors supposed some country brought near them;
{27:28} And having sounded, they found twenty fathoms; and having removed a little, and again having sounded, they found fifteen fathoms.
{27:29} And fearing lest perhaps we might fall through into rough places, having cast four anchors from the stern, prayed for day to come.
{27:30} And the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and having loosened the boat to the sea, for a pretext as about to extend the anchors from the prow,
{27:31} Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these should remain in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
{27:32} Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and suffered it to fall off.
{27:33} And till it was about to be day, Paul besought all to take food, saying, Awaiting this day the fourteenth day, ye continue fasting, having taken nothing.
{27:34} Wherefore I beseech you to take food: for this is for your salvation: for not a hair of the head of one of you shall fall.
{27:35} And having said these, and having taken bread, he returned thanks to God before all: and having broken, he began to eat.
{27:36} And all being cheerful, these also received food.
{27:37} And we were, all the souls in the ship, two hundred and seventy-six.
{27:38} And satisfied with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.
{27:39} And when it was day, they knew not the land: and they observed a certain deep bay having a coast, into which they resolved, if able, to push the ship.
{27:40} And having in removed the anchors, they let go into the sea, at the same time having let loose the bonds of the rudders, and having lifted up the mizen mast, they held with the blast to the coast.
{27:41} And having fallen into a place between two seas, they caused the ship to strike; and truly the prow, fixed firmly, remained undisturbed, but the stern was loosed by force of the waves.
{27:42} And the soldiers' counsel was that they kill the prisoners, lest any, having swum away, may escape.
{27:43} But the centurion wishing to save Paul, hindered from the resolution; and he commanded those being able to swim, having cast off first, to come to land:
{27:44} And the rest, truly some on boards, and some on certain things from the ship. And so it was, all were saved upon the land.
{28:1} And having been saved, then they knew that the island is called Melita.
{28:2} And the foreigners bestowed upon us no ordinary kindness: for having lighted a pile of wood, they received us all on account of the impending rain, and for the cold.
{28:3} And Paul having collected together a multitude of dried sticks, and placed upon the pile of wood, a viper, having come forth out of the heat, seized his hand.
{28:4} And when the foreigners saw the wild beast hanging on his hand, they said to one another, This man is altogether a murderer, whom, saved from the sea, vengeance suffered not to live.
{28:5} Who truly then, having shaken off the beast into the fire, suffered nothing evil.
{28:6} And they expected him about to be inflamed, or to fall down dead suddenly: and they waiting for much, and seeing nothing extraordinary coming to him, changing their opinions, they said he was a god.
{28:7} And with them about that place was landed property to the first of the island, by name Publius; who having received us, lodged us with friendship three days.
{28:8} And it was the father of Publius lay, held fast with fever and dysentery: to whom Paul, having come in and prayed, laid hands upon him, and healed him.
{28:9} Then this done, the rest having sicknesses in the island, came near, and were cured:
{28:10} And they honoured us with many honours; and to us getting under weigh, they set things for need.
{28:11} And after three months we were conveyed in a ship, having wintered in the island, of Alexandria, marked, Sons of Jove.
{28:12} And brought down to Syracuse, we tarried yet three days longer.
{28:13} Whence having come round, we arrived at Rhegium: and after one day the south wind having come up, we came the second day to Puteoli:
{28:14} Where having found brethren, we were besought by them to tarry yet seven days longer: and so we came to Rome.
{28:15} And thence the brethren, having heard of us, came out to our meeting as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom Paul having seen, having returned thanks to God, took courage.
{28:16} And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the commander of the camp: but to Paul it was permitted to remain by himself with a soldier watching him.
{28:17} And it was after three days Paul called together them being first of the Jews: and they having come together, he said to them, Men, brethren, I having done nothing against the people, or customs of the fathers, I was delivered in bonds from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
{28:18} Who, having examined me, wished to loose, for no cause of death was in me.
{28:19} And the Jews saying against, I was forced to appeal to Caesar; as having nothing to accuse my nation.
{28:20} For this cause therefore I besought to see you, and to speak: for, for the hope of Israel am I surrounded by this chain.
{28:21} And they said to him, We neither received letters concerning thee from Judea, nor any of the brethren having been present announced or spoke any evil of thee.
{28:22} And we desire to hear from thee what thou thinkest: for truly of this sect it is known to us that it is everywhere spoken against.
{28:23} And having appointed him a day, many came to him to the lodging; to whom testifying, he set forth the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and the prophets, from morn to eve.
{28:24} And some truly were persuaded by things spoken, and some disbelieved.
{28:25} And being at variance with one another, they were let go, Paul having said one word, That well spake the Holy Spirit by Esaias the prophet to our fathers,
{28:26} Saying, Go to this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and ye should not perceive:
{28:27} For the heart of this people was thickened, and with ears heard they heavily, and their eyes they closed; lest they should see with the eyes, and with ears should hear, and with the heart they should understand, and turn back, and I should heal them.
{28:28} Be it known to you therefore, that salvation of God was sent to the nations, and they shall hear.
{28:29} And he having said these things, the Jews departed, having much discussion in themselves.
{28:30} And Paul remained two whole years in his own wages, and received all going to him,
{28:31} Proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom of speech, unimpeded.
