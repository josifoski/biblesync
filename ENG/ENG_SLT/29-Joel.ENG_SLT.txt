{1:1} The word of Jehovah which was to Joel son of Pethuel.
{1:2} Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the earth. Was this in your days, and if in the days of your fathers?
{1:3} Concerning it recount to your sons, and your sons to their sons, and their sons to another generation.
{1:4} The residue of the creeping locust the common locust ate; and the residue of the common locust the feeder ate; and the residue of the feeder the devourer ate.
{1:5} Awake, ye intoxicated, and weep; and wail, all ye drinking wine, on account of the new wine, for it was cut off from your mouth.
{1:6} For a nation came up upon my land, strong, and no number; his teeth the teeth of a lion, and a biter's teeth of the lioness to him.
{1:7} He set my vine for destruction, and my fig tree for breaking: he stripped off its covering and cast away; and its shoots were whitened.
{1:8} Wail as the virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
{1:9} The gift was cut off and the libation from the house of Jehovah; mourn, ye priests serving Jehovah.
{1:10} The field was laid waste, the land mourned; for the grain was laid waste, the new wine was dried up, the new oil languished.
{1:11} The husbandmen were ashamed; wail, ye vine-dressers, for the wheat and for the barley, for the harvest of the field perished.
{1:12} The vine was dried up, and the fig tree languished; the pomegranate, also the palm tree and the apple tree; all the trees of the field were dried up, for joy was dried up from the sons of man.
{1:13} Be ye girded and lament, ye priests: wail, ye, serving the altar: come in, pass the night in sackcloth, ye serving God: for the gift and the libation were withheld from the house of your God.
{1:14} Consecrate a fast, call an assembly, gather together the old men, all the inhabitants of the land to the house of Jehovah your God, and cry to Jehovah.
{1:15} Alas! for the day: for the day of Jehovah is near, and as destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
{1:16} Was not the food cut off before our eyes, from the house of our God, joy and gladness?
{1:17} The kernels died beneath the clods, the treasures were laid waste, the garners were pulled down, for the grain was dried up.
{1:18} How the beasts groaned! the herds of oxen wept, for no pasture to them; also the flocks of sheep were laid waste.
{1:19} To thee, O Jehovah, will I call: for a fire consumed the habitations of the desert, and the flame burned all the trees of the field.
{1:20} Also the beasts of the field will look up to thee: for the channels of waters were dried up, and the fire devoured the habitations of the desert.
{2:1} Clang ye the trumpet in Zion, shout in my holy mountain: all the inhabitants of the land shall be moved, for the day of Jehovah is coming, for it is near.
{2:2} A day of darkness and of thick darkness; a day of cloud and gloom as the morning spread upon the mountains: great and strong people; the like to him was not from forever, and after him there shall not be added even to the years of generation and generation.
{2:3} Before him a fire devoured, and after him a flame shall burn; the land as the garden of Eden before him, and after him a desert of desolation; and also there was no escaping to him.
{2:4} His appearance as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen so shall they run.
{2:5} As the voice of chariots upon the heads of the mountains they shall leap, as the voice of a flame of fire devouring the stubble, as a strong people set in order for battle.
{2:6} From his face peoples shall be pained: all faces gathered a glow.
{2:7} They shall run as strong men; as men of war they shall come up upon the wall; and they shall go each in his ways; they shall not change their paths.
{2:8} And they shall not thrust a man his brother; they shall go a man in his high way: and in the midst of the javelin shall they fall, they shall not be cut in pieces.
{2:9} In the city they shall run up and down; on the wall shall they run, into the houses they shall come up, through the windows shall they come in as a thief.
{2:10} The earth was moved before his face; the heavens trembled: the sun and the moon were darkened, and the stars took away their shining:
{2:11} And Jehovah gave his voice before the face of his strength: for exceedingly great his camp, and strong he doing his word: for great the day of Jehovah, and exceedingly terrible; and who shall endure it?
{2:12} And also now, says Jehovah, Turn back even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping and with wailing.
{2:13} And rend your heart and not your garments, and turn back to Jehovah your God: for he is merciful and compassionate, slow of anger and of much kindness, and lamenting on account of the evil.
{2:14} Who shall know he will turn back, and lamenting and leaving a blessing after him, a gift and a libation to Jehovah your God?
{2:15} Clang ye the trumpet in Zion; consecrate a fast, call a restraining.
{2:16} Gather the people, consecrate the convocation, assemble the old men, gather the children and those sucking the breasts: the bridegroom shall come forth from his chamber and the bride from her nuptial couch.
{2:17} Between the porch and to the altar the priests serving Jehovah shall weep, and they shall say, Spare, O Jehovah, thy people, and thou wilt not give thine inheritance to reproach for the nations to rule over them: wherefore shall they say among the peoples, Where is their God?
{2:18} And Jehovah will be jealous for his land, and he will pity for his people.
{2:19} And Jehovah will answer and say to his people, Behold me sending to you the grain and the new wine, and the new oil; and ye were satisfied with it: and I will no more give you a reproach among the nations.
{2:20} And the northern I will remove far off from you, and I thrust him into a land of dryness and desolation, with his face to the east sea, and his end to the last sea; and his stink came up, and his stench shall come up, for he magnified to do.
{2:21} Thou shalt not fear, O land; rejoice and be glad, for Jehovah magnified to do.
{2:22} Ye shall not fear, ye beasts of the field, for the pastures of the desert sprang forth, for the tree bore its fruit, the fig tree and the vine gave their strength.
{2:23} Ye sons of Zion rejoice and be glad in Jehovah your God; for he gave to you the early rain for justice, and he will bring down to you the rain, the early and latter rain in the first.
{2:24} And the threshing-floors were filled with grain, and the wine-vats overflowed with new wine and new oil.
{2:25} And I requited to you the years which the common locust ate, the feeder, and the devourer, and the creeping locust, my great army which I sent among you.
{2:26} And eating, ye ate and were satisfied, and ye praised the name of Jehovah your God who did wonderfully with you: and my people shall not be ashamed forever.
{2:27} And ye knew that I am in the midst of Israel, and I am Jehovah your God, and none else: and my people shall not be ashamed forever.
{2:28} And it was after this I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters prophesied, your old men shall dream your young men shall see visions.
{2:29} And also upon the servants and upon the maids in those days I will pour out my spirit.
{2:30} And I gave wonders in the heavens, and in the earth, blood and fire and pillars of smoke.
{2:31} The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the coming of the great and the terrible day of Jehovah.
{2:32} And it was all who shall call upon the name of Jehovah shall escape: for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be an escaping, as said Jehovah; and among those left whom Jehovah called.
{3:1} For behold, in those days and in that time when I shall turn hack the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
{3:2} And I gathered all nations, and I brought them down to the valley of Jehoshophat, and I contended with them there for my people and mine inheritance Israel whom they scattered among the nations, and they divided the land.
{3:3} And for my people they cast the lot: and they will give the boy for a harlot, and they sold the girl for wine; and they will drink.
{3:4} And also what are ye to me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the circuits of Philistia? do ye requite to me a recompense? and if ye recompense to me, swiftly and speedily I will turn back your recompense upon your head;
{3:5} For ye took my silver and my gold, and my delights of good things ye brought to your temples.
{3:6} And the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem ye sold to the sons of the Grecians, in order to remove them far off from their border.
{3:7} Behold me raising them up from the place where ye sold them there, and I turned back your recompense upon your head:
{3:8} And I sold your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they sold them to the Sabeans to a nation far off: for Jehovah spake.
{3:9} Call ye this among the nations: Consecrate war; rouse up the strong ones, they shall draw near, all the men of war shall come up.
{3:10} Beat your plough-shares into swords, and your pruning-knives into spears: the weak shall say, I am strong.
{3:11} Hasten and come all ye nations from round about, and be ye gathered together: there lead down, O Jehovah, thy strong ones.
{3:12} The nations shall be roused and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there I will sit to judge all the nations from round about.
{3:13} Send ye forth the sickle, for the harvest was ripened: come ye, go down, for the wine press was filled, the vats, overflowed; for their evil is great.
{3:14} Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of judgment: for the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of judgment.
{3:15} The sun and the moon were darkened, and the stars took away their shining.
{3:16} And Jehovah shall cry out from Zion, and from Jerusalem he shall give his voice; and the heavens and the earth trembled: and Jehovah the refuge to his people, and the fortress to the sons of Israel.
{3:17} And ye knew that I am Jehovah your God dwelling in Zion my holy mountain: and Jerusalem was holy, and strangers shall no more pass through her.
{3:18} And it was in that day the mountains shall drop new wine, and the hills shall flow milk, and all the channels of Judah shall flow waters, and a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and it watered the valley of acacias.
{3:19} Egypt shall be for a desolation, and Edom shall be for a desert of desolation from violence to the sons of Judah, because they poured out innocent blood in their land.
{3:20} And Judah shall dwell forever, and Jerusalem to generation and generation.
{3:21} And I cleansed their blood I cleansed not: and Jehovah dwelt in Zion.
