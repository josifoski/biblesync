{1:1} The words of the preacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem.
{1:2} Vanity of vanities, said the preacher; vanity of vanities, all vanity.
{1:3} What the profit to a man in all the labor he will labor under the sun?
{1:4} A generation went away, and a generation came: and the earth stood forever.
{1:5} The sun arose and the sun went down, and panted after its place which it arose there.
{1:6} Going to the south and turning round about to the north, it turned round about; the wind turned round about, going, and the wind turned back upon its circuits.
{1:7} All the torrents going into the sea, and the sea not full: to the place the torrents going, there they turn back to go.
{1:8} All words becoming weary; man shall not be able to speak: the eye shall not be satisfied to see, and the ear shall not be filled from hearing.
{1:9} What was, that shall be; and what was done, that shall be done: and not anything new under the sun.
{1:10} Is there a word will be said, See, this is new? This was already to a long time which was before us.
{1:11} No remembrance to former things; and also to the latter things that shall be; to them shall be no remembrance with them which shall be for the latter state.
{1:12} I the preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
{1:13} And I gave my heart to seek and to search out in wisdom concerning all which was done under the heavens: this evil business God gave to the sons of man to be occupied in it.
{1:14} I saw all the works they did under the sun; and behold, all vanity and striving of the spirit.
{1:15} The crooked thing shall not be able to be made straight: and the deficiency shall not be able to be numbered.
{1:16} It spake with my heart, saying, Behold, I was magnified, and added wisdom over all that were before me at Jerusalem: and my heart saw much of wisdom and knowledge.
{1:17} And I will give my heart to know wisdom, and the knowledge of praise and understanding: I knew this also it is the striving of the spirit.
{1:18} For in abundance of wisdom, abundance of trouble: and he adding knowledge will increase pain.
{2:1} I said in my heart, Go now, I will prove thee with gladness, and look thou upon good: and behold, this also vanity.
{2:2} To laughter I said, It is mad: and to gladness, What did this?
{2:3} I examined in my heart to draw my flesh with wine, and my heart led in wisdom; and to lay hold upon folly till that I shall see what this good to the sons of man which they will do under the heavens the number of the days of their life.
{2:4} I magnified my work; I builded to me houses; I planted to me vineyards:
{2:5} I made to me gardens and pleasure grounds, and I planted in them a tree of all fruit.
{2:6} I made to me pools of waters to water from them the forest, causing trees to spring forth.
{2:7} I obtained servants and maids, and sons of the house were to me; also obtaining cattle, and many sheep were to me more than all that were before me in Jerusalem.
{2:8} I gathered to me also silver and gold, and the wealth of kings, and the provinces: I made to me men singing and women singing, and the delights of the sons of men, a wife and mistresses.
{2:9} And I was magnified and increased more than all being before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom stood to me.
{2:10} And all that mine eyes asked I kept not back from them, and I withheld not my heart from all gladness; for my heart rejoiced from all my labor: and this was my portion from all my labor.
{2:11} And I looked upon all my works my hands made, and upon the labor I labored to do, and behold, all vanity and striving of the spirit, and no profit under the sun.
{2:12} And I turned to see wisdom, madness, and folly: for what the man that shall come after the king? with those things they did already.
{2:13} And I saw there is profit to wisdom more than to folly, as the excellence of the light above darkness.
{2:14} The wise, his eyes in his head; and the foolish one goes in darkness: and I knew, I also, that one event will meet with them all.
{2:15} And I said in my heart, As the event of the foolish one, also I, it will meet me; and wherefore then was I more wise? And I spake in my heart, This is also vanity.
{2:16} For no remembrance for the wise with the foolish one forever, since in the days coming, all being forgotten. And how will the wise die? with the foolish one.
{2:17} And I hated life, for evil to me the work done under the sun: for all vanity and striving of the spirit.
{2:18} And I hated all my labor I laboring under the sun: leaving it to the man who shall come after me.
{2:19} And who shall know whether he shall be wise or foolish? And he shall have dominion over all my labor which I labored, and was wise under the sun. Also this is vanity.
{2:20} And I turned about to let my heart despair for all the labor I labored under the sun.
{2:21} For there is man his labor in wisdom, and in knowledge and in success; and to man not laboring in it he shall give his portion. Also this is vanity and much evil.
{2:22} For what was to man in all his labor, and in the striving of his heart, he labored under the sun?
{2:23} For all his days pains, and vexation, his labor; also in the night his heart rested not Also this it is vanity.
{2:24} Not good in man he shall eat and drink and cause his soul to see good in his labor. Also this I saw that it is from the hand of God.
{2:25} For who shall eat, and who shall hasten forth above me?
{2:26} For to a man good before his face, he gave wisdom and knowledge and gladness: and to him sinning, he gave labor, to gather and to heap up, to give to the good one before the face of God. Also this is vanity and the striving of the spirit.
{3:1} To all a season, and a time to every inclination under the heavens:
{3:2} A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up the planting.
{3:3} A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build:
{3:4} A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance:
{3:5} A time to cast away stones, and a time to collect stones a time to embrace, and a time to be far from embracing:
{3:6} A time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to watch, and a time to cast away.
{3:7} A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to be silent, and a time to speak:
{3:8} A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace:
{3:9} What the excellence of him working in what he labored?
{3:10} I saw the labor which God gave to the sons of man to be humbled in it.
{3:11} He made everything beautiful in his time: also he gave hidden time in their heart, so that man shall not find the work which God did from the beginning and even to the end.
{3:12} I knew that no good is in them, but to rejoice and to do good in his life.
{3:13} And also every man shall eat and drink, and see the good in all his labor; it is the gift of God.
{3:14} I knew that all which God will do it shall be forever: to it not to be added, and from it not to be taken away: and God doing they shall be afraid from his face.
{3:15} What was, it is already; and what to be, was already; and God will seek him being driven away.
{3:16} And yet I saw under the sun the place of judgment, there the unjust one; and the place of the just one, there the unjust one.
{3:17} I said in my heart, The just one and the unjust one, God will judge: for a time for every inclination and for every work there.
{3:18} I said in my heart concerning the speeches of the sons of man, for God to separate them, and for them to see that they are cattle to themselves.
{3:19} For the event of the sons of man, and the event of the cattle, one event to them: as this, so dies this; and the breath of one to all; and the preeminence of man not above the cattle: for all is vanity.
{3:20} All go to one place; all were from dust, and all turned back to dust.
{3:21} Who shall know the spirit of the sons of man? it ascending to above, and the spirit of cattle, it going downwards to the earth.
{3:22} And I saw that no good more than that man shall rejoice in his works; for this is his portion: for who shall bring him to look upon what shall be after him?
{4:1} And I turned back, and I shall see all the oppressions which are doing under the sun: and behold, the tears of the oppressed, and none comforting to them; and from the hand of those oppressing them was power, and none comforting to them.
{4:2} And I praise the dead already dead more than the living they yet living.
{4:3} And good above them two which were not yet, which saw not the evil work which was done under the sun.
{4:4} And I saw all the labor and all the success of the work, for this the jealousy of a man from his neighbor. Also this is vanity and striving of spirit.
{4:5} The foolish one folded his hands together, and ate his flesh.
{4:6} Good a hand filled with rest, above two hands full of labor and striving of spirit.
{4:7} And I turned back, and I shall see vanity under the sun.
{4:8} There is one, and not a second; also a son and brother not to him: and no end to all his labor; also his eye shall not be satisfied with riches: and for whom do I labor and diminish my soul from good? Also this is vanity, and it is an evil labor.
{4:9} Two are good above one, because there is to them a good reward in their labor.
{4:10} For if they shall fall, the one will raise up his companion: and wo to him, the one that shall fall, and not a second to raise him up.
{4:11} Also if two shall lie down, and heat to them: and to the one it shall not be warm.
{4:12} And if one shall become strong against him, two shall stand before him; and a three-fold thread shall not be quickly broken.
{4:13} Good a poor and wise child above an old and foolish king, who knew not more to receive instruction.
{4:14} For from the house of those turning away he came forth to reign; for also he being born in his kingdom became poor.
{4:15} I saw all the living going under the sun, with the second child which shall stand in his stead.
{4:16} No end to all the people, to all which were before them: also the last ones shall not rejoice in him. For also this is vanity and striving of the spirit.
{5:1} Watch thy feet when thou shalt go to the house of God, and draw near to hear, rather than give the sacrifice of the foolish, for they not knowing the doing of evil.
{5:2} Thou shalt not hasten with thy mouth, and thy heart shall not be quick to bring forth a word to the face of God: for God is in the heavens, and thou upon the earth: for this thy words shall be few.
{5:3} For the dream came in the multitude of labor; and the voice of the foolish one in the multitude of words.
{5:4} When thou shalt vow a vow to God, thou shalt not delay to repay it; for there is no desire in the foolish: repay what thou shalt vow.
{5:5} Good that thou shalt not vow rather than thou shalt vow and not requite.
{5:6} Thou shalt not give thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; and thou shalt not say to the face of the messenger that it is an error: wherefore shall God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?
{5:7} For in the multitude of dreams, and vanities, and many words: but fear thou God.
{5:8} If thou shalt see the oppression of the poor one, and the spoiling of judgment and justice in a province, thou shalt not wonder at the inclination: for the high one above the high one is watching, and the high ones over them.
{5:9} And the profit of the earth in all: it is the king being served to the field.
{5:10} He loving silver shall not be satisfied with silver; and whoever loved not the increase with the multitude. Also this is vanity.
{5:11} In the multitude of good they were multiplied eating it: and what the success to its possessors but seeing with his eyes?
{5:12} The sleep of the servant is sweet, if little, or if much he shall eat: and the satiety to the rich not permitting to him to sleep.
{5:13} There is an evil making sick I saw under the sun: riches watched to its owners for their evil.
{5:14} And those riches shall perish by evil labor: and he begetting a son, and not anything in his hand.
{5:15} According as he came forth from his mother's womb, naked he shall turn back to go as he came, and he shall not take away anything in his labor that shall go in his hand.
{5:16} And also this an evil making sick, wholly as he came so shall he go: and what to him he shall labor for the wind?
{5:17} Also all his days in darkness shall he eat, and much vexation and his sickness and his anger.
{5:18} Behold, what I saw: good, which is beautiful to eat and to drink, and to see good in all his labor that he will labor under the sun the number of the days of his life, which God gave to him; for this his portion.
{5:19} Also every man which God gave to him wealth and riches, and permitted him to eat from it, and to lift up his portion, and to rejoice in his labor; this the gift of God himself.
{5:20} For he shall not much remember the days of his life; for God humbles him in the gladness of his heart.
{6:1} There is evil which I saw under the sun, and it is much upon man:
{6:2} A man which God will give to him wealth and riches and honor, and wanting not to his soul from all which he shall desire, and God will not permit him to eat from it, for a man, a stranger shall eat it. This is vanity and it is an evil disease.
{6:3} If a man shall beget a hundred, and live many years, and a multitude shall be the days of his years, and his soul shall not be satisfied from good, and also there was no burial to him; I said, Good above him an abortion.
{6:4} For in vanity he came, and in darkness he will go away, and his name shall be covered with darkness.
{6:5} Also he saw not the sun, and he knew not rest to this above this.
{6:6} And although he lived a thousand years twice, and he saw not good. Did not all go to one place?
{6:7} All the labor of man for his mouth, and also the soul shall not be filled.
{6:8} For what will remain to the wise one more than the foolish one? what to the poor that shall know to go before the living.
{6:9} Good the sight of the eyes above the going of the soul. Also this is vanity and striving of spirit.
{6:10} What was, its name was called already, and it was known that it is man: and he shall not be able to contend with the powerful above him.
{6:11} For there is many words increasing vanity, what shall remain to man?
{6:12} For who shall know what is for man in life, the number of the days of the life of his vanity, and he will make them as a shadow? for who shall announce to man what shall be after him under the sun?
{7:1} A good name is above good oil, and the day of death above the day of birth.
{7:2} Good to go to the house of mourning rather than to go to the house of drinking, in that it is the end of every man; and he living shall give to his heart.
{7:3} Good is grief above laughter: for in the illness of the face the heart shall be good.
{7:4} The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; and the heart of the foolish in the house of gladness.
{7:5} Good to hear the reproof of the wise one, above a man hearing the song of the foolish:
{7:6} For as the voice of thorns under the pot, so the laughter of the foolish one. Also this is vanity.
{7:7} For oppression will make foolish the wise one; and a gift will destroy the heart.
{7:8} Good the last of a word above its beginning: good slowness of spirit above pride of spirit.
{7:9} Thou shalt not be hastened in thy spirit to be angry, for anger shall rest in the bosom of fools.
{7:10} Thou shalt not say, Why was it the former days were good above these? for thou didst not ask from wisdom concerning this.
{7:11} Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and a remainder to those seeing the sun.
{7:12} For in the shadow, wisdom; in the shadow, silver: and the excellence of knowledge is wisdom shall preserve alive those possessing it.
{7:13} See the work of God: for who shall be able to make straight what he made it crooked?
{7:14} In the day of good, be in good; and in the day of evil, see thou: also God made this over against this, to the end that man shall not find anything after him.
{7:15} I saw all in the days of my vanity: there is a just one perishing in his justice, and there is an unjust one, being prolonged in his evil.
{7:16} Thou shalt not be greatly just; and thou shalt not be exceedingly wise: wherefore wilt thou be made desolate?
{7:17} Thou shalt not be greatly wicked, and thou shalt not be foolish: wherefore wilt thou die not in thy time?
{7:18} Good that thou shalt hold fast upon this; also from this thou shalt not lead away thy hand: for he fearing God shall come forth with all of them.
{7:19} Wisdom shall strengthen to the wise one more than ten having power which were in the city.
{7:20} For not a just man in the earth, who shall do good and not sin.
{7:21} Also to all the words that shall be spoken thou shalt not give thy heart, that thou shalt not hear thy servant cursing thee.
{7:22} For also many times thy heart knew that thou didst also curse others.
{7:23} All this I proved by wisdom: I said I will be wise, and it was removed far off from me.
{7:24} What was far off, and the depth, deep, who shall find it?
{7:25} I went round about, I and my heart, to know, and to examine, and to search out wisdom and understanding, and to know the injustice of folly, and the folly of wickedness:
{7:26} And I find bitter above death the woman that her heart it is snares and nets, her hands are bonds: the good one before God shall escape from her, and he sinning shall be taken by her.
{7:27} See, this I found, said the preacher: one to one to find understanding.
{7:28} Which yet my soul sought, and found not; one man from a thousand I found; and a woman in all these I found not.
{7:29} Only see, this I found, that God made man upright; and they sought out many purposes.
{8:1} Who as the wise one? and who will know the interpretation of the word? The wisdom of man shall enlighten his face, and the hard of face shall be hated.
{8:2} I am to watch the king's mouth by reason of the oath of God.
{8:3} Thou shalt not hasten going from his face: thou shalt not stand by the word of evil; for he shall do all that he will desire.
{8:4} Wheresoever the word of a king, it is powerful: and who shall say to him, What wilt thou do?
{8:5} He watching the command knew no evil word: and time and judgment the wise one will know.
{8:6} To every inclination there is time and judgment; for man's evil is great upon him.
{8:7} For he will not know what shall be: for as it shall be who shall announce to him?
{8:8} No man having power in spirit to restrain the spirit: and no power in the day of death: and no sending forth in war; and injustice shall not deliver its possessors.
{8:9} All this I saw, and giving my heart to every work which was done under the sun: a time which man had power over man for evil to him.
{8:10} And so then I saw the unjust buried, and they came and they will go from the holy place, and they will be forgotten in the city where they did thus: also this is vanity.
{8:11} Because a decree was not done quickly upon an evil work, for this the heart of the sons of man was filled in them to do evil.
{8:12} Whoever sinned, doing evil a hundred, and it being prolonged to him, for also I know that it will be to those fearing God, who shall be afraid from his face.
{8:13} And it shall not be good to the unjust one; he shall not lengthen the days as a shadow, for he feared not from before the face of God.
{8:14} There is vanity which was done upon the earth; that there is the just which it comes upon them according to the work of the unjust: and there is the unjust, it comes upon them according to the work of the just. I said, Also this is vanity.
{8:15} And I praised joy, because there is no good to man under the sun but to eat and to drink, and to rejoice: for this shall lodge with him in his labor the days of his life which God gave to him under the sun.
{8:16} According as I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to see the labor that was done upon the earth: for also in the day and in the night he saw not sleep with his eyes.
{8:17} And I saw all the work of God, that no man shall be able to find out the work that was done under the sun in whatsoever a man shall labor to seek out, and he shall not find: and also if the wise one shall say to know, he shall not be able to find.
{9:1} For all this I gave to my heart, and to examine all this, that the just and the wise and their works are in the hand of God: also love, also hatred, no man shall know of all before them.
{9:2} All according to all: one event to the just one and to the unjust one; to the good one and to the clean one, and to the unclean one; to him sacrificing and to him not sacrificing: as the good one, so the sinning one; he swearing, as he who shall fear an oath.
{9:3} This an evil in all being done under the sun, thus one event is to all: and also the heart of the sons of man being full of evil, and folly in their heart in their living, and after it to their deaths.
{9:4} For whoever shall choose to all the living there is hope: for to a living dog it is good above a dead lion.
{9:5} For the living know they shall die: and the dead know not any thing, and no more to them a reward; for their remembrance was forgotten.
{9:6} Also their love, also their hatred, also their envy perished already; and no more portion to them forever in all which was done under the sun.
{9:7} Go eat in joy thy bread, and drink thy wine in a good heart; for already God was satisfied with thy works.
{9:8} In all time thy garments shall be white; and ointment shall not be wanting upon thy head.
{9:9} See life with the wife which thou didst love all the days of the life of thy vanity which he gave to thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for this thy portion in life, and in thy labor which thou laborest under the sun.
{9:10} All which thy hand shall find to do, with thy strength, do thou; for no work and understanding and knowledge and wisdom, in hades where thou goest there.
{9:11} I turned back, and saw under the sun that not to the fleet the race, and the war not to the strong, and also not to the wise, bread; and also not to the understanding ones, riches; and also not to the knowing, favor; for time and chance will light upon all of them.
{9:12} For also man knew not his time: as the fishes being laid hold of in an evil net, and as the birds laid hold of in the snare, as they, the sons of men being snared for an evil time, as it will fall upon them suddenly.
{9:13} Also this I saw, the wisdom under the sun, and it was great to me:
{9:14} A little city, and men in it few; and a great king came against it, and surrounded it, and built against it great entrenchments:
{9:15} And a poor wise man was found in it, and he delivered the city by his wisdom; and not a man remembered that poor man.
{9:16} And I said, Wisdom is good above strength: and the wisdom of the poor one was despised, and his words not heard.
{9:17} The words of the wise being heard in quiet more than the cry of him ruling among the foolish.
{9:18} Wisdom is good above the instruments of encounter: and one sinning will destroy much good.
{10:1} Flies of death will cause the oil of the perfume to stink, it will ferment: the preciousness of wisdom above the honor of the least folly.
{10:2} The heart of the wise one to his right, and the heart of the foolish one to his left.
{10:3} And also as the foolish one went in the way, his heart was wanting, and he said to all, It is folly.
{10:4} If the spirit of him ruling shall go up against thee, thou shalt not leave thy place; for quietness will put down great sins.
{10:5} There is an evil I saw under the sun as an error going forth from before him having power:
{10:6} Folly was given to great heights, and the rich were set in lowness.
{10:7} I saw servants upon horses, and chiefs going as servants upon the earth.
{10:8} He digging a ditch shall fall into it; he breaking down a wall, a serpent shall bite him.
{10:9} He removing stones; shall suffer pain by them; and he cleaving woods asunder shall be endangered by them.
{10:10} If the iron became dull and he polished not the face, and he will strengthen the forces: and wisdom will make preeminence to prosper.
{10:11} If a serpent will bite without magic; and no preeminence to the possessor of the tongue.
{10:12} The words of the wise one's mouth, grace; and the lips of the foolish one shall swallow him down.
{10:13} The beginning of the words of his mouth, folly: and the latter state of his mouth the folly of evil.
{10:14} And the foolish one will multiply words: man shall not know what shall be; and what shall be after him, who shall announce to him?
{10:15} The labor of the foolish will weary them, because he knew not to go to the city.
{10:16} Wo! to thee, O land: thy king a youth, and thy chiefs will eat in the morning.
{10:17} Happy thou, O land: thy king the son of nobles, and thy chiefs shall eat in time, in strength and not in drinking.
{10:18} By sloth the frame work will pine away; and by the letting down of the hands, the house will drop.
{10:19} For laughter they make bread, and wine will gladden the living: and silver will answer with all.
{10:20} Thou shalt not curse the king in thy consciousness, and in thy bed-chamber thou shalt not curse the rich for the bird of the heavens will bring the voice, and the possessor of wings shall announce the word.
{11:1} Send forth thy bread upon the face of the waters, for in a multitude of days thou shalt find it.
{11:2} Thou shalt give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou shalt not know what shall be evil upon the earth.
{11:3} If the clouds shall be filled with rain, they shall pour out upon the earth: and if the tree shall fall in the south or in the north, the place the tree shall fall, there it shall be.
{11:4} He watching the wind shall not sow; and he looking in the clouds, shall not reap.
{11:5} As thou wilt not know what the way of the spirit, as the bones in the womb of her being filled, so thou shalt not know the work of God who will make all.
{11:6} In the morning sow thy seed, and at evening thou shalt not let thy hand rest: for thou shalt not know whether this shall be right, this or that, or if they two as one being good.
{11:7} And the light is sweet, and good to the eyes to see the sun:
{11:8} If man shall live many years, in them all shall he rejoice; and he shall remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. All coming is vanity.
{11:9} Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and thy heart shall do thee good in the days of thy youth, and go in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: and know thou, that for all these God will bring thee into judgment.
{11:10} And put away anger from thy heart, and cause evil to pass away from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.
{12:1} And remember him creating thee in the days of thy youth, till even when the days of evil shall not come, and the years draw near in which thou shalt say, Not to me delight in them;
{12:2} Till when the sun shall not be darkened, and the light, and the moon, and the stars, and the clouds turned not back after the rain:
{12:3} In the day those watching the house shall tremble, and the strong men bent themselves, and the grinders ceased for they were few, and they looking through the lattice were darkened,
{12:4} And the doors were shut in the street, in the lowness of the voice of the grinding, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of the song shall bow down;
{12:5} Also from height they shall be afraid, and being dismayed in the way, and the almond tree shall be despised, and the locust shall become a burden, and the caperberry shall fail: for man shall go to his eternal house, and they mourning, went about in the street:
{12:6} Till when the cord of silver shall be removed far off, and the bowl of gold be broken, and the bucket shall be broken at the fountain, and the wheel broken at the cistern.
{12:7} And the dust shall turn back to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall turn back to God who gave it.
{12:8} Vanity of vanities, said the preacher; all is vanity.
{12:9} And besides, the preacher was wise; he yet taught the people knowledge; and he gave ear, and sought out, setting in order many parables.
{12:10} The preacher sought to find words: of delight: and that written was straight, words of truth.
{12:11} The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails planted of the masters of the gatherings; they were given from one shepherd.
{12:12} And besides, from these, my son, beware: of making many books, no end; and much study wearies the flesh.
{12:13} We will hear the end of all the word: Fear thou God, and watch his commands: for this is all man.
{12:14} For God will bring every work into judgment, with every thing hidden, whether good, and whether evil.
