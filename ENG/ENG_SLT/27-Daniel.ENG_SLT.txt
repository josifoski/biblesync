{1:1} In the third year to the kingdom of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel to Jerusalem, and he will press it.
{1:2} And Jehovah will give Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, and from the number of vessels of the house of God: and he will bring them to the land of Shinar the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.
{1:3} And the king will say to Ashpenaz the leader of his eunuchs to bring from the sons of Israel and from the seed royal, and from the nobles;
{1:4} Children whom not any blemish in them, and good of aspect, and understanding in all wisdom, and knowing knowledge, and understanding intelligence, and to whom power in them to stand in the king's temple, and to teach them the writing and tongue of the chaldees.
{1:5} And the king will allot to them the word of a day in its day from the king's dainties and from the wine of his drinking: and to nourish them three years, and from the end of three years they shall stand before the king.
{1:6} And there will be among them from the sons of Judah, Daniel, Hansniah, Mishael, and Azariah.
{1:7} And the chief of the eunuchs will set names to them: to David, Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, Shadrach; and to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abed-Nego.
{1:8} And Daniel will set up upon his heart that he will not be defiled with the dainties of the king, and with the wine of his drinking: and he will seek from the chief of the eunuchs that he shall not defile himself.
{1:9} And God will give Daniel to mercy and compassion before the chiefs of the eunuchs.
{1:10} And the chief of the eunuchs will say to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who allotted your food and your drink: for wherefore shall he see your faces gloomy above the children as of your age? and make my head guilty to the King.
{1:11} And Daniel will say to Melzar, whom the chief of the eunuchs appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
{1:12} Prove now thy servants, ten days; and they shall give to us from seed herbs, and we will eat, and water, and we will drink.
{1:13} And our aspects shall be seen before thee, and the aspect of the children eating the king's dainties: and according to what thou shalt see, do with thy servants.
{1:14} And he wilt hear to them for this word, and he will try them ten days.
{1:15} And from the end of ten days their aspect was seen good and fat of flesh above all the children eating of the king's dainties.
{1:16} And Melzar will be taking away their dainties, and the wine of their drinking, and he gave to them seed herbs.
{1:17} And these four children, God gave to them knowledge and understanding in all writing and wisdom: and Daniel understood in every vision and dreams.
{1:18} And from the end of the days when the king said to bring them in, and the chief of the eunuchs will bring them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
{1:19} And the king will speak with them: and there was not found from all of them as Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: and they will stand before the king.
{1:20} And every word of the wisdom of understanding which the king sought from them, and he will find them ten hands over all the sacred scribes, the enchanters which were in all his kingdom.
{1:21} And Daniel will be even to one year to Cyrus the king.
{2:1} And in the second year to the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, and his spirit will be moved, and his sleep was broken upon him.
{2:2} And the king will say to call to the sacred scribes, and to the enchanters, and to the sorcerers, and to the Chaldeans, to announce to the king his dreams. And they will come and stand before the king.
{2:3} And the king will say to them, I dreamed a dream, and my spirit will be moved to know the dream.
{2:4} And the Chaldeans will speak to the king Syriac: O king, live forever: say to thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.
{2:5} The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The word went out from me: if ye will not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, ye shall be made pieces, and your houses shall be set dung-hills.
{2:6} And if ye shall show the dream and its interpretation, ye shall receive from before me a gift and present, and great honor: therefore shove me the dream and its interpretation.
{2:7} They answered a second time, and said, The king will say to his servants the dream, and we will show its interpretation.
{2:8} And the king answered and said, Certainly I know that ye buy the time, for which cause that ye saw that the word went out from me.
{2:9} Enough if ye will not make known to me the dream, this one edict for you; and ye divided out the word of falsehood and this corruption to say before me, till that the time shall change: therefore say to me the dream and I shall know that ye will show me its interpretation.
{2:10} The Chaldean answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the dry land that shall be able to show the king's word: for which cause that every king, leader, and ruler, asked not a word like this to any sacred scribe, and enchanter, and Chaldean.
{2:11} And the word the king asked will be made rare, and there is not another that will show it before the king except the gods that their dwelling is not with flesh.
{2:12} For this cause the king was indignant and greatly angry, and he spake to destroy to all the wise of Babel.
{2:13} And the edict went forth and the wise men being killed; and they sought Daniel and his associates to be killed.
{2:14} At that time Daniel turned back counsel and reason to Arioch, leader of the king's executioners, that went forth to kill to the wise of Babel:
{2:15} He answered and said to Arioch the king's ruler, For what the severe edict from before the king? Then Arioch made known the word to Daniel.
{2:16} And Daniel went up and sought from the king that he will give time for it, and to show to the king the interpretation.
{2:17} Then Daniel departed to his house, and made known the word to Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah his companions:
{2:18} And for seeking companions from before the God of the heavens concerning this secret: that Daniel and his companions shall not be destroyed with the rest of the wise of Babel.
{2:19} Then to Daniel in a vision of the night was the secret uncovered. Then Daniel praised to the God of the heavens.
{2:20} Daniel answered and said, For this the name of God being praised from forever and even to forever: for wisdom and strength are to him:
{2:21} And he changes the times and the seasons; removing kings and setting up kings; giving wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those knowing understanding.
{2:22} He uncovered deep and hidden things: he knew what in darkness, and light lodged with him.
{2:23} For thee, O God of my fathers, I praise and laud that thou gavest me wisdom and strength, and now didst make known to me what we sought from thee: for thou didst make known to us the king's word.
{2:24} For this cause Daniel went up to Arioch whom the king allotted to destroy the wise of Babel: he went and said thus to him: For the wise of Babel thou shalt not destroy: bring me up before the king, and I will show the interpretation to the king.
{2:25} Then with haste Arioch brought up for Daniel before the king, and said thus to him, That I found a man from the sons of the captivity of Judah that will make known to the king the interpretation.
{2:26} The king answered and said to Daniel, his name Belteshazzar, Is it to thee to be able to make known to me the dream that I saw, and its interpretation?
{2:27} Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret that the, king asked, not the wise men, the enchanters, the sacred scribes, the diviners, shall be able to show to the king;
{2:28} But there is a God in the heavens revealing secrets, and he made known to king Nebuchadnezzar what to be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, it is thus:
{2:29} Thou, O king, thy thoughts upon thy bed went up what to be after this: and he revealing secrets made known to thee what to be.
{2:30} And I not for wisdom that is in me more than all living is this secret revealed to me, but for the reason that they shall make known the interpretation to the king, and thou shalt know the thoughts of thy heart.
{2:31} Thou, O king, wert seeing, and behold, one great image. This image vast, and its brightness excellent; it stood before thee, and its aspect terrible.
{2:32} This image, its head of good gold, the breasts and arms of silver, and the bowels and thighs of brass:
{2:33} The legs of iron, the feet part of iron, and part of burnt clay.
{2:34} Thou wert seeing even till a stone was cut out not with hands, and striking against the image upon the feet of iron and burnt clay, and breaking them in pieces.
{2:35} At that time were beaten small at once, the iron, the burnt clay, the brass, the silver and the gold, and they were as the chaff of the threshing-floor of summer; and the wind lifted them up and all place was not found for them: and the stone striking against the image was for a great rock, and filled all the earth.
{2:36} This the dream, and we will tell its interpretation before the king.
{2:37} Thou, O king, a king of kings: for the God of the heavens gave to thee a kingdom strong and powerful, and splendid.
{2:38} And in all that the sons of men dwelt, the beasts of the open field and the birds of the heavens he gave into thine hand, and gave thee power over them all Thou this head of gold.
{2:39} And after thee shall arise another kingdom lower than thee, and another third kingdom of brass, that shall have power over all the earth.
{2:40} And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, because that iron beats small, and makes thin all: and as iron breaks all these, it shall beat small and break.
{2:41} And that thou sawest the feet and toes, part of burnt clay of the potter, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; and from the firmness of iron to be in it, for which cause that thou sawest iron mingled with earthen-ware.
{2:42} And the toes of the feet, part of iron, and part of burnt clay, from the end of the kingdom shall be strong, and part shall be cut asunder.
{2:43} That thou sawest the iron mingled with the earthen-ware, mingling for themselves with the seed of men: and not cleaving to them this with this, so as iron not mingling with burnt clay.
{2:44} And in their days that they are kings, the God of the heavens shall set up a kingdom that shall not be destroyed forever: and its kingdom shall be left to another people; it shall beat small and destroy all these kingdoms, and this shall stand forever.
{2:45} Because that thou sawest that the stone being cut from the rock not with hands, and it beat small the iron, the brass, the burnt clay, the silver and the gold: the great God made known to the king what to be after this: and the dream certain, and its interpretation faithful.
{2:46} At that time king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and prostrated himself to Daniel, and said to pour out a gift and sweet odors to him.
{2:47} And the king answered to Daniel, and said, of a truth that your God he is God of gods, and Lord of kings, and revealing secrets, that thou wert able to reveal this secret.
{2:48} Then the king multiplied to Daniel, and gave to him many a great gift, and gave him power over all the province of Babel, and chief of the prefects over all the wise of Babel.
{2:49} And Daniel sought from the king, and he appointed out over the business of the province of Babel to Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego: and Daniel in the gate of the king.
{3:1} Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold; its height sixty cubits, and its breadth six cubits: he set it up in the valley of Dura, in the province of Babel.
{3:2} And Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together to the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the chief judges, the treasurers, those skilled in law, the lawyers, and all the rulers of the provinces, to the drinking to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up.
{3:3} At that time there being gathered together the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the chief judges, the treasurers, those skilled in law, the lawyers and all the rulers of the provinces, to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up; and standing before the image that Nebuchadnezzar set up.
{3:4} And a herald called with strength, To you they say, O peoples, nations, and tongues,
{3:5} In the time ye shall hear the voice of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the lyre, the psaltery, the bagpipe, and all sorts of music, ye shall fall and prostrate yourselves to the image of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up.
{3:6} And whoever shall not fall and prostrate himself in the same moment, he shall be cast into a furnace of flaming fire.
{3:7} For this cause in that time that all peoples heard the voice of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the lyre, the psaltery, and all sorts of music, all peoples, nations, and tongues, fell prostrating themselves to the image of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up.
{3:8} For this cause, at that time men of the Chaldeans drew near and ate up the Jews piece meal.
{3:9} They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live forever.
{3:10} Thou, O king, didst set an edict, that every man that shall hear the voice of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the lyre, the psaltery and the bagpipe, and all sorts of music, shall fall and prostrate himself to the image of gold:
{3:11} And whoever shall not fall and prostrate himself shall be cast into the midst of a furnace of flaming fire.
{3:12} There are men, Jews, that thou didst appoint over the business of the province of Babel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego; these men set not an account to thee, O king: they served not to thy gods; and to the image of gold that thou didst set up they prostrated themselves not.
{3:13} At that time Nebuchadnezzar in anger and wrath, said to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. Then they brought these men before the king.
{3:14} Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, Is it on purpose O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed Nego, ye not serving to my gods, and to the image of gold that I set up, ye not prostrating yourselves?
{3:15} Now if ye being prepared that in the time that ye shall hear the voice of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the lyre, the psaltery, and the bagpipe, and all sorts of music, ye shall fall and prostrate yourselves to the image that I made; and if ye shall not prostrate yourselves in the same moment, ye shall be cast into the midst of the furnace of flaming fire; and who that God that shall deliver you from my hands?
{3:16} Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego answered, and saying to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we need not to turn back to thee upon this word.
{3:17} If it is, our God whom we served will be able to deliver us from the furnace of flaming fire, and from thy hand, O king, he will deliver us.
{3:18} And if not, it shall be made known to thee, O king, that to thy gods we serve not, and to the image of gold that thou didst set up we will not prostrate ourselves:
{3:19} In that time Nebuchadnezzar being filled with wrath, and the form of the visage was changed to him against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego: he answered and said to heat to the furnace one seven times above that it was seen to be heated.
{3:20} To the strong, the strong of strength that were in his army, he said to bind to Shadrach, Mesbach, and Abed-Nego, to cast into the furnace of flaming fire.
{3:21} Then these men were bound in their wide trowsers, their tunics, and their mantles, and their clothing, and were cast into the midst of the furnace of flaming fire.
{3:22} For this cause, as the word of the king being severe, and the furnace exceedingly heated, these men that took up to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, the flame of fire killed them.
{3:23} And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, fell into the midst of the furnace of flaming fire, bound.
{3:24} At that time Nebuchadnezzar the king was grieved, and rose up in haste; he answered and said to the counselors, Did we not cast three men into the midst of the fire, bound? They answering and saying to the king, True, O king.
{3:25} He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose going about in the midst of the fire, and there is no hurt in them: and the aspect of the fourth like to the Son of God.
{3:26} At that time Nebuchadnezzar drew near to the door of the furnace of flaming fire; he answered and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, ye servants of God most high, go forth, and come. Then came forth Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, from the midst of the fire.
{3:27} And there being gathered together the satraps, the prefects, and governors, and the king's counselors, looking upon these men that upon their bodies the fire had no power, and a hair of their head was not singed, and their wide trowsers were not changed, and the smell of fire passed not upon them.
{3:28} Nebuchadnezzar answered and said, Blessed be their God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who sent his messenger and delivered for his servants that trusted upon him, and they changed the king's word, and gave their bodies that they will not serve and prostrate themselves to any god, except to their God.
{3:29} And an edict being set from me, That every people, nation and tongue, that shall say an error against their God, of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, shall be made pieces, and his house shall be set a dung-hill, because that there is no other God that shall be able to deliver according to this.
{3:30} Then the king caused to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, to prosper in the province of Babel.
{4:1} Nebuchadnezzar the king to all peoples, nations and tongues, that dwell in all the earth, your peace shall become great.
{4:2} The signs and wonders that the most high God made with me, it was pleasant before me to show.
{4:3} His signs, how many! and his wonders, how mighty! his kingdom, an eternal kingdom, and his dominion with generation and generation.
{4:4} I Nebuchadnezzar, was secure in my house, and green in my temple:
{4:5} I saw a dream, and it will terrify me; and the conceptions upon my bed and the visions of my head, will cause me to tremble.
{4:6} And an edict being set from me to bring up before me to all the wise of Babel, that they shall make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
{4:7} At that time the sacred scribes, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the diviners, coming in: and I told the dream before them: and its interpretation they making not known to me.
{4:8} And even at last Daniel came up before me, whose name Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods in him: and before him I told the dream:
{4:9} O Belteshazzar, leader of the sacred scribes, for I knew that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and my secret pressed not upon thee; the visions of my dream that I saw, and its interpretation, say thou.
{4:10} And the visions of my head upon my bed; I was seeing, and lo, a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height great.
{4:11} And the tree increased and was strong, and its height will reach to the heavens, and its sight to the end of all the earth:
{4:12} Its foliage beautiful, and its fruit great, and food for all in it: and the beasts of the open field will be shaded under it, the buds of the heavens will dwell in its boughs, and all flesh will be nourished from it.
{4:13} I was seeing in the visions of my head upon my bed, and lo, a watcher and holy one came down from the heavens;
{4:14} He called with strength, and thus he said, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its foliage and scatter its fruit: the beasts shall flee from under it, and the birds from its branches.
{4:15} But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the open field; and in the dew of the heavens it shall be wet, and its portion with the beasts in the green herb of the earth.
{4:16} Its heart shall be changed from man, and the heart of a beast shall be given to it; and seven times shall pass over him.
{4:17} The word by the decree of the watchers, and the saying of the holy ones is the question: for the reason that the living shall know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and to whom that he will, he will give it, and he will raise up over it the low of men.
{4:18} This dream, I king Nebuchadnezzar saw. And thou Belteshazzar, tell the interpretation, because that all the wise of my kingdom not being able to make known to me the interpretation: and thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.
{4:19} Then Daniel, his name Belteshazzar, was astonished for one moment, and his thoughts terrified him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, the dream and its interpretation shall not terrify thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream to those hating thee, and its interpretation to thine enemies.
{4:20} The tree that thou sawest that increased and was strong, and its height will reach to the heavens, and its sight to all the earth,
{4:21} And its foliage beautiful, and its fruit great, and food for all in it; under it the beast of the open field will dwell, and in its branches the birds of the heavens will dwell:
{4:22} It is thou, O king, who increased and wert strong: and thy greatness increased and reached to the heavens, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
{4:23} And that the king saw a watcher and a holy one came down from the heavens, and said, Hew down the tree and destroy it; but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the open field; and with the dew of the heavens it shall be wet, and with the beasts of the open field its portion, even till seven times shall pass over him;
{4:24} This the interpretation, O king, and this the decree of the Most High, that came upon my lord the king:
{4:25} And for thee driving from men, and with the beasts of the open field to be thy dwelling, and they shall feed to thee grass as oxen, and wetting to thee from the dew of the heavens, and seven times shall pass over thee till that thou shalt know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and to whom that he will, he will give it.
{4:26} And that they said to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom being sure to thee, from when thou shalt know that the heavens rule.
{4:27} Wherefore, O king, my counsel shall be pleasant to thee, and break off thy sins by justice, and thine iniquities in compassionating the poor; if it shall be a lengthening to thy peace.
{4:28} All came upon Nebuchadnezzar the king.
{4:29} At the end of twelve months in the temple of the kingdom of Babel, he was going about.
{4:30} The king answered and said, Is not this great Babel, that I built it for the house of the kingdom by the strength of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?
{4:31} Yet the word in the king's mouth, a voice from the heavens fell to thee, being said, O Nebuchadnezzar the king, the kingdom passed away from thee:
{4:32} And from men driving thee out, and with beasts of the open field thy dwelling: and they shall feed to thee the grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee till that thou shalt know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and to whom he will, he will give it.
{4:33} In the same moment the word was added upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven out from men, and he shall eat the green herb as oxen, and from the dew of the heavens his body shall be wet till that his hair was increased as eagles, and his nails as birds'.
{4:34} And at the end of the days, I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes to the heavens, and my knowledge will turn back to me, and I praised to the Most High, and to him living forever, I praised and honored, whose dominion an eternal dominion, and his kingdom with generation and generation.
{4:35} And all the generations of the earth being reckoned as nothing: and doing according to his station in the army of the heavens, and the generations of the earth: and there is none that shall strike upon his hand, and say to him, What didst thou?
{4:36} In that time my knowledge will turn back to me: and for the honor of my kingdom, my splendor and my brightness will return to me; and my counselors and my nobles will seek to me: and I was established over my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me.
{4:37} Now I Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor to the king of the heavens, that all his works are truth, and his paths judgment: and that they going about in pride, he being able to bring low.
{5:1} Belshazzar the king made great food for a thousand of his nobles, and before the thousand he drank wine.
{5:2} Belshazzar said, in tasting the wine, to bring in for the vessels of gold and silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father brought forth from the temple that was in Jerusalem; and in them the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines, will drink.
{5:3} At that time they brought the vessels of gold that were brought forth from the temple of the house of God which was in Jerusalem; and in them they drank, the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines.
{5:4} They drank wine, and praised to the gods of gold and silver, brass, iron, wood and stone.
{5:5} In the same moment went forth fingers of a man's hand and wrote before the candlestick upon the lime of the wall of the temple of the king: and the king saw the palm of the hand that wrote.
{5:6} The king's brightnesses changing, and his thoughts will terrify him, and the knots of his loins breaking forth, and his knees knocked this upon that.
{5:7} The king called with strength to bring up the enchanters, the Chaldeans and the diviners. The king answered and said to the wise of Babel, Whatever man that shall read this writing, and will show to me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple, and a necklace of gold upon his neck, and shall rule the third in the kingdom.
{5:8} Then came in all the king's wise ones: and they were not able to read the writing, and to make known the interpretation to the king.
{5:9} Then king Belshazzar being greatly terrified, and his brightnesses being changed upon him, and his nobles being perplexed.
{5:10} The queen, on account of the king's words and his nobles', came in to the house of drinking: the queen answered and said, O king, live forever: thy thought shall not terrify thee, and thy brightnesses shall not be changed:
{5:11} There is a man in thy kingdom that the spirit of the holy gods in him; and in the days of thy father, his light and his understanding and wisdom according to the wisdom of the gods was found in him; and king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king thy father, set him up leader of the sacred scribes, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, the diviners:
{5:12} Because that an excellent spirit and knowledge, and his understanding interpreting dreams, and showing of enigmas, and solving knotty questions, was found in him, in Daniel whom the king set his name Belteshazzar: now Daniel shall be called, and he will show the interpretation.
{5:13} At that time Daniel came in before the king. The king answered and said to Daniel, Is it thou, Daniel, which is from the sons of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought from Judah?
{5:14} I heard concerning thee that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and his light and his understanding and excellent wisdom was found in thee.
{5:15} And now the wise ones, the enchanters, were brought in before me that they shall read this writing, and to make known to me its interpretation: and they were not able to show the interpretation of the word:
{5:16} And I heard concerning thee, that thou wilt be able to interpret interpretations, and solve knotty questions: now if thou shalt be able to read the writing, and to make known to me its interpretation, thou shalt be clothed in purple, and a necklace of gold upon thy neck, and thou shalt rule the third in the kingdom.
{5:17} At that time Daniel answered and said before the king, Thy gifts to be to thyself, and give thy presents to another; but I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
{5:18} Thou, O king, God most high gave a kingdom and greatness and honor and splendor to Nebuchadnezzar thy father:
{5:19} And from the greatness that he gave to him, all peoples, nations and tongues, were trembling and fearing from before him: whom he was willing he killed; and whom he was willing, he was saving alive; and whom be was willing, he was setting up; and whom he willed he was humbling.
{5:20} And when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was strong for pride, he was brought down from the throne of his kingdom, and they took away his honor from him.
{5:21} And he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made level with the beasts, and with wild asses his dwelling: they will feed him with the green herb as oxen, and from the dew of the heavens his body will be wet; till that he knew that God the Most High ruled in the kingdom of men, and to whom he will, he will set up over it.
{5:22} And thou his son, O Belshazzar, didst not humble thy heart because that thou knewest all this;
{5:23} And against the Lord of the heavens thou didst lift up thyself; and for the vessels of his house they brought before thee, and thou and thy nobles, and thy wives, and thy concubines, drinking wine in them; and to the gods of silver and gold, brass, iron, wood, and stone, who see not, and hear not, and know not, thou didst praise: and to the God whom thy breath in his hand, and all thy ways to him, thou didst not honor.
{5:24} At that time from before him was sent the palm of the hand, and this writing written.
{5:25} And this the writing that was written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL and PHARSIN.
{5:26} This the interpretation of the word: Mene; God numbered thy kingdom and completed it.
{5:27} Tekel; Thou shalt be weighed in the balances and be found wanting.
{5:28} Pharsin; Thy kingdom was divided, and it shall be given to the Medes and to Persia.
{5:29} At that time Belshazzar said, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and a necklace of gold upon his neck, and they cried out concerning him, for him to rule the third in the kingdom.
{5:30} In that night Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans was killed.
{5:31} And Darius the Median received the kingdom, as the son of two and sixty years.
{6:1} It pleased before Darius and he set up over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, whom to be over all the kingdom;
{6:2} And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was one: that to them the satraps giving to them account, and the king not for him detriment.
{6:3} Then this Daniel excelling above the presidents and satraps because that an excellent spirit was in him; and the king doing to set him up over all the kingdom.
{6:4} Then the presidents and satraps were seeking to find a pretext against Daniel from the part of the kingdom; and they will not be able to find any pretext and corruption, because that he was faithful, and any error and corruption was not found upon him.
{6:5} Then these men saying that, We shall not find against this Daniel any pretext except we shall find against him in the law of his God.
{6:6} Then these presidents and satraps ran together with tumult to the king, and saying thus to him, O Darius the king, live thou forever.
{6:7} All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects and satraps, and counselors and governors, will counsel together to set up a statute of the kingdom, and to make strong an interdict that whoever shall seek a request from any God and man even to thirty days, except from thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
{6:8} Now, O king, wilt thou set up the interdict, and sign the writing, that not to be changed according to the law of Media and Persia, which shall not pass away.
{6:9} For this cause, king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.
{6:10} And Daniel as soon as he knew that the writing was signed, went up into his house; and the windows being opened to him in his upper chambers before Jerusalem, three times in the day he kneeled upon his knees, and praying and praising before his God, for the cause that he did from before this.
{6:11} Then these men ran together with tumult and found Daniel seeking and making supplication before his God.
{6:12} At that time they drew near, and saying before the king concerning the interdict of the king, Didst thou not sign an interdict that every man that shall seek from any God and man even for thirty days, except from thee, O King, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The word is certain, according to the law of Media and Persia, that shall not pass away.
{6:13} At that time they answered, and saying before the king, That Daniel that is from the sons of the captivity of Judah set not up an account to thee, O king, and to the interdict that thou didst sign; and three times in the day he sought his requests.
{6:14} Then the king as soon as he heard the word, was greatly displeased with himself, and upon Daniel he set the heart to set him free: and even to the going down of the sun he was exerting himself to deliver him.
{6:15} At that time these men ran together with tumult to the king, and saying to the king, Know, O king, that the law to Media and Persia is, that every interdict and statute that the king shall set up is not to be changed.
{6:16} At that time the king said, and they brought Daniel and cast into the den of the lions; the king answered and said to Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest to him continually, he will set thee free.
{6:17} And one stone was brought and set upon the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his signet ring, and with the signet ring of his nobles, that the will shall not be changed upon Daniel.
{6:18} Then the king departed to his temple and passed the night fasting: and he brought not his concubines before him, and his sleep fled from him.
{6:19} At that time the king will rise in the dawn in the morning, and in haste he departed to the lion's den.
{6:20} And in his drawing near to the den he cried to Daniel with a strong voice, the king answered and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, thy God whom thou servest to him continually, is he able to set thee free from the lion's den?
{6:21} Then Daniel said to the king, O king, live forever.
{6:22} My God sent his messenger and shut the mouth of the lions, and they hurt me not, for the cause that innocence was found to me; and also before thee, O king, I did no hurt.
{6:23} At that time the king rejoiced greatly for him, and to Daniel he said to be taken up from the den. And Daniel was taken up from the den, and any hurt was not found upon him, for he trusted in his God.
{6:24} And the king said, and they brought these men that ate up Daniel piece meal, and cast into the lion's den, them, their sons, and their wives; and they not down to the bottom of the den even till the lions had power over them, and they broke all their bones in pieces.
{6:25} At that time Darius the king wrote all peoples, nations and tongues, that are dwelling in all the earth, Your peace shall be great.
{6:26} From before me a decree was set forth that in every dominion of my kingdom to be trembling and fearing from before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and standing forever, and his kingdom that shall not be destroyed, and his dominion even to the end.
{6:27} Setting free and delivering, and working signs and wonders in the heavens and upon the earth, that set free to Daniel from the hand of the lions.
{6:28} And this Daniel was prospered in the kingdom of Darius, and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian.
{7:1} In one year to Belshazzar the king of Babel, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: at that time he wrote the dream, telling the head of the words.
{7:2} Daniel answered and said, I was seeing in my vision by night, and lo, the four winds of the heavens rushing forth to the great sea.
{7:3} And four great beasts went up from the sea, different this from this.
{7:4} The first as a lion, and the wings of an eagle to it; I was seeing even till its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and upon its feet it was caused to stand as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
{7:5} And lo, another beast, a second being like to a bear; and it rose up to one side, and three ribs in its mouth between its teeth: and saying to it thus, Arise, eat much flesh.
{7:6} After this I was seeing, and lo, another, as a panther, and to it four wings of a bird upon its back, and four heads to the beast; and dominion was given to it.
{7:7} After this I was seeing in the visions of the night, and lo, a fourth beast, fearful, and strong and powerful exceedingly; and great teeth of iron to it, eating and beating small, and treading down the remainder with its feet: and it being different from all the beasts that were before it; and ten horns to it.
{7:8} I was considering upon the horns, and lo, another little horn went up among them, and three from the first horns were plucked up from before it: and lo, eyes as the eyes of a man in this horn, and a mouth speaking great things.
{7:9} I was seeing even till thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days sat, his garment white as snow, and the hair of his head as pure wool: his throne a flame of fire, his wheels a burning fire.
{7:10} A river of fire flowed and went out from before him: thousands of thousands will wait upon him, and myriads of myriads will stand before him: the tribunal sat, and the books were opened.
{7:11} I was seeing at that time from the voice of the great words that the horn was speaking: I was seeing even till that the beast was killed and its body destroyed, and it was given to the burning fire.
{7:12} And the rest of the beasts they took away their power: and length in life was given to them for a season and time.
{7:13} I was seeing in the visions of the night, and lo, with the clouds of the heavens as the Son of man he came, and turning even to the Ancient of days; and they brought him near before him.
{7:14} And to him was given dominion, power and honor, and a kingdom; and all peoples and nations and tongues shall serve to him: his power an eternal power that shall not pass away, and his kingdom which shall not be destroyed.
{7:15} I Daniel was grieved in the midst of the sheath, and the visions of my heart will terrify me.
{7:16} I drew near to one of those standing by, and I sought from him the truth concerning all this: and he said to me, and he will cause me to know the interpretation of the words.
{7:17} Those great beasts that they are four, four kings they shall rise up from the earth.
{7:18} And the holy ones of the Most High shall take the kingdom and shall possess the kingdom even to forever, and even to forever of forever.
{7:19} Then I willed to speak the truth concerning the fourth beast that was different from all of them, exceedingly fearful, its teeth of iron and its hoofs of brass; eating, beating small, and treading down the remainder with its feet;
{7:20} And concerning the ten horns that were upon its head, and the other that went up, and three fell from before it; and this horn and eyes to it, and a mouth speaking great things, and its sight great above its companions.
{7:21} I was seeing, and this horn made an encounter with the holy ones, and prevailed against them;
{7:22} Even till that the Ancient of days came, and the judgment was given to the holy ones of the Most High; and the time extending and the holy ones possessed the kingdom.
{7:23} Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom in the earth, that shall be different from all kingdoms, and shall eat up all the earth, and shall tread it down and beat it.
{7:24} And the ten horns from this kingdom, ten kings shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be different from the first, and he shall humble three kings.
{7:25} And he shall speak words against the Most High, and he shall vex the holy ones of the Most High, and he will hope to change times and law: and they shall be given into his hand even to a time and times, and the dividing of time.
{7:26} And the tribunal sat, and they shall take away his power to cut off and to destroy even to the end.
{7:27} And the kingdom and the power, and the greatness of the kingdom under All the heavens was given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High his kingdom an eternal kingdom, and all powers shall serve to him, and shall hear.
{7:28} Even to this the end of the word. I Daniel, my thoughts will greatly terrify me, and my brightness will be changed upon me: and I kept the word in my heart.
{8:1} In the third year to the kingdom of Belshazzar the king a vision was seen to me, I Daniel, after that being seen to me in the beginning.
{8:2} And I shall see in a vision; and it will be in my seeing, and I in Shushan the fortress, in Elam the province; and I shall see in a vision, and I was by the stream of strength.
{8:3} And I shall lift up mine eyes, and I shall see, and behold, one ram stood before the stream, and horns to him: and the horns high; and the one high above the second, and the high came up at the last.
{8:4} And I saw the ram pushing the sea, and north and south; and all the beasts will not stand before him, and none delivering from his hand; and he did according to his will, and increased.
{8:5} And I was considering, and behold, a he goat of the goats came from the west upon the face of all the earth, and not touching upon the earth: and the he goat a horn of vision between his eyes.
{8:6} And ha will come even to the ram possessing the horns, which I saw standing before the stream, and he will run against him in the wrath of his power.
{8:7} And I saw him coming near to the ram, and he will be exasperated against him, and he will strike the ram and break his two horns: and there will be no power in the ram to stand before him, and he will cast him to the earth, and will tread upon him: and there was none delivering for the ram out of his hand.
{8:8} And the he goat of the goats increased even greatly: and in his being strong the great horn was broken; and there will come up the vision of four underneath it to the four winds of the heavens.
{8:9} And from one of them came forth one horn of a little thing, and it will be great exceedingly to the south to the sunrisings, and to the glories.
{8:10} And it will be great even to the army of the heavens; and it will cast to the earth from the army, and from the stars, and it will tread them down.
{8:11} And even to the chief of the army was he magnified, and from him the continuance was lifted up, and the foundation of his holy place was cast down.
{8:12} And an army will be given upon the continuance by transgression, and it will cast down truth to the earth; and it did and it succeeded.
{8:13} And I shall hear one holy one speaking, and one holy one will say to a certain one, speaking, How long the vision of the continuance, and the transgression laying waste, to be? and the holy place and the army being trodden down?
{8:14} And he will say to me, Even to evening morning, two thousand and three hundred; and the holy place was justified.
{8:15} And it will be in my seeing, I Daniel, the vision, and I shall seek its understanding, and behold, there stood before me as the sight of a man,
{8:16} And I shall hear man's voice between Ulai, and he will call and say, Man of God, cause to this to understand the sight.
{8:17} And he will come near my standing: and in his coming I was afraid, and I shall fall upon my face; and he will say to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end, the vision.
{8:18} And in his speaking with me I lay in a deep sleep upon my face upon the earth: and he will touch upon me and will cause me to stand upon my standing.
{8:19} And he will say, Behold me making known to thee what shall be in the last part of the wrath: for at the appointment, the end.
{8:20} The ram which thou sawest possessing horns, the kings of Media and Persia.
{8:21} And the hairy he goat, the king of Grecia: and the great horn which is between his eyes, he the first king.
{8:22} And that being broken, and four will stand up underneath it, four kingdoms from the nation shall stand up, and not in his power.
{8:23} And in the latter state of their kingdom as those transgressing being completed, a king strong of face and understanding enigmas, shall stand up.
{8:24} And strong his power, and not in his power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and he prospered, and did, and he destroyed the strong ones and the holy people.
{8:25} And by his intelligence and he caused deceit to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify in his heart, and in security he shall destroy many: and against the Chief of chiefs he shall stand; and without hand shall he be broken.
{8:26} And the sight of the evening and the morning which was said, it is truth: and shut thou up the vision; for, for many days.
{8:27} And I Daniel was, and was sick days; and I shall rise and do the works of the king; and I shall be astonished at the sight, and none understanding.
{9:1} In one year to Darius son of Ahasuerus, from the seed of Media who reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans.
{9:2} In one year to the kingdom, I Daniel understood by books the number of years which the word of Jehovah was to Jeremiah the prophet, to fill up for the desolations of Jerusalem seventy years.
{9:3} And I will give my face to Jehovah God to seek prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes:
{9:4} And I will pray to Jehovah my God, and I will confess and say, Ah, Jehovah, the great and dreadful God, watching the covenant and the mercy to those loving him, and to those watching his commands:
{9:5} We sinned, and we did iniquity, and were evil, and rebelled, and departing from thy commands and from thy judgments.
{9:6} And we heard not to thy servants the prophets who spake in thy name to our kings and our chiefs and our fathers, and to all the people of the earth.
{9:7} To thee, O Jehovah, justice, and to us shame of face, as this day to the men of Judah, and to those dwelling in Jerusalem, and to all Israel being near and being far off, in all the lands where thou didst thrust them there in their transgression which they transgressed against thee.
{9:8} O Jehovah, to us shame of face, to our kings, to our chiefs, and to our fathers, that we sinned against thee.
{9:9} To Jehovah our God compassion and forgivenesses, for we rebelled against him.
{9:10} We heard not to the voice of Jehovah our God to go in his laws which he gave before us in the hand of his servants the prophets.
{9:11} And all Israel passed by thy Laws, and departing not to hear to thy voice; and the curse will be poured upon us, and the oath which was written in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we sinned against him.
{9:12} And he will set up his words which he spake against us, and against our judges who judged us to bring against us a great evil: which was not done under all the heavens according to what was done in Jerusalem.
{9:13} As that written in the law of Moses all this evil came upon us, and we supplicated not the face of Jehovah our God to turn back from our iniquities and to understand in thy truth.
{9:14} And Jehovah will watch for evil, and will bring it upon us: for Jehovah our God is just upon all his works which he did: and we heard not to his voice.
{9:15} And now, O Jehovah our God, who brought thy people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand, and thou wilt make to thee a name as this day; we sinned, we did evil.
{9:16} O Jehovah, according to all thy justice, now shall thine anger be turned back, and thy wrath from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people for a reproach to all those round about us.
{9:17} And now, O our God, hear to the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy desolated holy place, for sake of Jehovah.
{9:18} Incline, O my God, thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and see our desolations, and the city which thy name was called upon it: for not for our justice do we cause our supplications to fall before thee, but for thy many compassions.
{9:19} O Jehovah hear; O Jehovah forgive; O Jehovah, attend and do; thou wilt not delay for thy sake, O my God: for thy name was called upon thy city and upon thy people.
{9:20} And I yet speaking and praying and confessing my sins, and the sins of my people Israel, and causing my supplication to fall before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God;
{9:21} And I yet speaking in prayer, and the man Gabriel, whom I saw in the vision in the beginning, being wearied with weariness, touched upon me about the time of the evening gift.
{9:22} And he will cause to understand, and will speak with me, and say, O Daniel, now came I forth to teach thee understanding.
{9:23} In the beginning of thy supplications the word came forth, and I came to announce; for thou art desires: and understand thou in the word, and consider in the sight.
{9:24} Seventy seventy were divided upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to close the transgression, and to seal up sins, and to expiate iniquity, and to bring in eternal justice, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the holy of holies.
{9:25} And thou shalt know and understand, from the going forth of the word to turn back and to build Jerusalem even to Messiah the leader, seventy weeks, and sixty and two weeks: and the street shall turn back and be built, and the ditch, in the trouble of the times.
{9:26} And after sixty and two weeks, Messiah shall be cut off, and not for him: and the people of the leader coming shall destroy the city and the holy place; and its end with an overflowing, and even to the end of the war desolations were determined.
{9:27} And he made strong the covenant to many one week: and half the week he shall cause the sacrifice and gift to cease, and upon the wing of abominations laying waste, even to the completion, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolation.
{10:1} In the third year to Cyrus king of Persia the word was revealed to Daniel, whom his name was called Belteshazzar; and the word truth, and the warfare great: and he understood the word, and understanding to him in the sight.
{10:2} And in these days I Daniel was mourning three weeks of days.
{10:3} Bread of desires I ate not, and flesh and wine came not into my mouth, and anointing, I did not anoint myself even to the filling up of three weeks of days.
{10:4} And in the twenty and fourth day to the first month, and I was upon the hand of the great river, this is Hiddekel;
{10:5} And I shall lift up mine eyes and see, and behold, one man being clothed with linen garments, and his loins being girded with gold of Uphaz:
{10:6} And his body as topaz, and his face as the sight of lightning, and his eyes as flames of fire, and his arms and his feet as the eye of polished brass, and the voice of his words as the voice of a multitude.
{10:7} And I saw, I Daniel alone, the sight: and the men that were with me saw not the sight, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they will flee in hiding themselves.
{10:8} And I was left alone, and I shall see this great sight, and strength was not left in me: and my honor was turned upon me into destruction, and I retained not strength.
{10:9} And I shall hear the voice of his words: and in my hearing the voice of his words, and I was lying in a deep sleep upon my face, and my face to the earth.
{10:10} And behold, a hand touched upon me, and it will move me upon my knees, and the palms of my hands.
{10:11} And he will say to me, O Daniel, a man of desires, understand thou in the words which I speak to thee, and stand upon thy standing: for now was I sent to thee. And in his speaking with me this word I stood trembling.
{10:12} And he will say to me, Thou shalt not fear, Daniel: for from the first day that thou gavest thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I came for thy words.
{10:13} And the chief of the kingdom of Persia stood against me twenty and one days: and behold, Michael, one of the first chiefs, came, to help me; and I was left there near the kings of Persia.
{10:14} And I came to cause thee to understand what shall happen to thy people in the last of the days: for yet the vision for days.
{10:15} And in his speaking with me according to these words I gave my face to the earth, and I was dumb.
{10:16} And behold, as the likeness of the sons of man touched upon my lips: and I shall open my mouth and speak and say to him standing before me, O my lord, by the sight my straights were turned upon me, and I retained not strength.
{10:17} And how shall this servant of my lord be able to speak with this my lord and I, from this time no strength will stand in me, and breath was not left in me.
{10:18} And there will add and will touch upon me as the sight of man, and he will strengthen me.
{10:19} And he will say, Thou shalt not fear, O man of desires: peace to thee; be strong, and be strong. And in his speaking with me I was strengthened, and saying, My lord shall speak; for thou didst strengthen me.
{10:20} And he will say, Knewest thou wherefore I came to thee? and now I will turn back to war with the chief of Persia: and I shall go forth, and behold, the chief of Grecia coming.
{10:21} But I will announce to thee that recorded in the writing of truth: and not one strengthening himself with me upon these things but Michael your chief.
{11:1} And I in the one year to Darius the Mede, standing to make firm and to strengthen for him.
{11:2} And now I will announce the truth to thee. Behold, yet three kings standing up to Persia; and the fourth shall be rich of great riches above all: and in his becoming strong in his riches he shall rouse up all against the kingdoms of Grecia.
{11:3} And a strong king stood up, and he ruled from much dominion, and he did according to his will.
{11:4} And in his standing up his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided to the four winds of the heavens; and not to his latter state, and not according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, and for others from besides these.
{11:5} And the king of the south shall be strong, and from his chiefs; and he shall be strong above him, and he ruled from much dominion.
{11:6} And at the end of years they shall join themselves together, and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make straightnesses: and she shall not retain the power of the arm, and he shall not stand, and his arm: and she shall be given up, and those bringing her, and he begetting her, and he strengthening her in the times.
{11:7} And there stood up from the shoot of her roots as he, and he shall come to the strength, and he shall come into the fortress of the king of the north, and he did against them, and was strong:
{11:8} And also their gods with their molten images, with the vessels of their desire of silver and gold he shall bring in captivity to Egypt; and he shall stand years above the king of the north.
{11:9} And the king of the south came into his kingdom, and turned back, to his land.
{11:10} And his sons shall gather themselves together, and they collected a multitude of many forces: and he coming, came and overflowed, and through: and he will turn back, and they shall gather themselves together even to his fortress.
{11:11} And the king of the south shall be exasperated, and shall come forth and war with him, with the king of the north: and he caused a great multitude to stand, and the multitude was given into his hand.
{11:12} And taking away the multitude his heart shall be lifted up; and he cast down myriads, and he shall not be strengthened.
{11:13} And the king of the north turned back and caused a great multitude to stand above the former, and at the end of times, years, coming he shall come with great strength and with much property.
{11:14} And in these times many shall stand up against the king of the south: and the sons of the violent of thy people shall be lifted up to cause the vision to stand; and they were weak.
{11:15} And the king of the north shall come and shall pour out a mound, and take the city of fortifications: and the arms of the south shall not stand, and the people of his choices, and no strength to stand.
{11:16} And he coming against him will do according to his will, and none standing before his face: and he shall stand in the land of glory, and it was finished in his hand.
{11:17} And he shall set up his face to come with the power of all his kingdom, and the upright with him; and he did: and he will give to him the daughter of women, to corrupt her: and she shall not stand, and shall not be for him.
{11:18} And he will turn back his face to the isles and take many: and a leader caused his reproach to cease to him; besides his reproach shall turn back to him.
{11:19} And he shall turn back his face to the fortress of his land: and he was weak and he fell, and he shall not be found.
{11:20} And there stood up upon his place he causing a task-master to pass through the glory of his kingdom: and in some days he shall be broken, and not in anger and not in war.
{11:21} And there stood up upon his place he being despised; and they gave not upon him the strength of the kingdom: and he came in tranquillity, and he took the kingdom by flatteries.
{11:22} And with the arms of an overflowing they shall overflow from his face, and they shall be broken; and also the leader of the covenant.
{11:23} And from being joined to him he shall do deceit: and he came up and was strong with a small nation.
{11:24} And in security and in fatnesses of the province shall he come; and he did what his fathers did not, and the fathers of his fathers; the prey and spoil and property shall he scatter to them: and against the fortifications he shall reckon his purposes, and even to a time.
{11:25} And his strength shall rouse up and his heart against the king of the south with great force; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to war with a great and strong force, even exceedingly; and he shall not stand, for they shall reckon purposes against him.
{11:26} And they eating his dainties shall break him, and his force shall overflow: and many fell wounded.
{11:27} And they two kings, their heart for doing evil, and at one table they will speak falsehood; and it shall not prosper: for yet the end at the appointment.
{11:28} And he shall turn back to his land with great property; and his heart against the holy covenant; and he did, and turned back to his land.
{11:29} At the appointment he shall turn back, and come into the south; and it shall not be as the first, and as the last.
{11:30} And the inhabitants of the desert, the Chittims came against him: and he was dejected, and he turned back, and was angry against the holy covenant: and he did, and turned back; and he shall understand for those forsaking the holy covenant.
{11:31} And seed from him shall stand up, and they profaned the holy place of strength, and they removed the Continuance, and they gave the abomination laying waste.
{11:32} And those condemning the covenant shall pollute by smooth things: and the people knowing their God shall be strong and do.
{11:33} And those understanding of the people shall cause to understand to many: and they were weak by the sword, and by flame, and by captivity, and by plunder, days.
{11:34} And in their being weak they shall be helped with a little help: and many were joined to them by flatteries.
{11:35} And from those understanding shall be weak to try upon them to separate, to become white even to the time of the end: for yet at the appointment.
{11:36} And the king did according to his will; and he shall exalt himself and magnify himself over every god; and against the God of gods he shall speak wonderful things, and he prospered even till anger was finished: for that being determined was done.
{11:37} And concerning the God of his fathers he shall not understand, and concerning the desire of women, and concerning every god he shall not understand; for he shall magnify himself over all.
{11:38} And to the God of fortresses he shall do honor upon his place: and to a god which his fathers knew not he shall do honor with gold and with silver, and with precious stone, and with desires.
{11:39} And he did to the strong fortifications with a strange god whom he recognized, he shall multiply honor: and he caused them to rule over many, and he will divide the land for a price.
{11:40} And in the time of the end the king of the south shall wage war with him: and the king of the north shall rush on like a tempest against him, with chariot and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he came into the lands, and overflowed and passed through.
{11:41} And he came into the land of glory, and many shall be weak: and these shall escape from his hand, Edom and Moab, and the first of the sons of Ammon.
{11:42} And he shall send forth his hand upon the lands, and the land of Egypt shall not be for escaping.
{11:43} And he ruled over the hidden things of gold and silver, and over all the desires of Egypt: and the Lybians and Cushites in his steps.
{11:44} And reports from the sunrising and from the north shall terrify him: and he shall go forth in great wrath to destroy, and to exterminate many.
{11:45} And he shall plant the tent of his palace between the seas to the mountain of glory of holiness: and he came even to his end, and none helping to him.
{12:1} And in that time Michael the great chief shall stand up, he standing for the sons of thy people: and it was a time of straits that was not from there being a nation, even to that time: and in that time thy people shall escape, every one being found written in the book.
{12:2} And many sleeping in the earth of dust shall awake, these to eternal life, and these to reproach and eternal abhorrence.
{12:3} And those understanding shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and those justifying many, as the stars forever and ever.
{12:4} And thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run through and knowledge shall be multiplied.
{12:5} And I Daniel saw, and behold, two others standing, one hence upon the lip of the river, and one thence upon the lip of the river.
{12:6} And he will say to the man clothed with linen garments which was above to the waters of the river, Till when the end of the wonders?
{12:7} And I shall hear the man clothed with linen garments, who was above to the waters of the river, and he will lift up his right hand and his left to the heavens, and swear by him living forever, that for an appointment of appointments and a half; in the scattering of the hand of the holy people being finished, all these shall be finished.
{12:8} And I heard, and I shall not understand: and saying, O my lord, what the last of these things?
{12:9} And he will say, Go, Daniel: for the words being shut up and sealed even to the time of the end.
{12:10} And many shall be separated and become white, and be tried; and the unjust did evil: and all the unjust shall not understand; and the intelligent shall understand.
{12:11} And from the time of removing the continuance, and to give the abomination laying waste, a thousand two hundred and ninety days.
{12:12} Happy he waiting, and he shall reach to the thousand three hundred and thirty and five days.
{12:13} And go thou to the end: and thou shalt rest and stand upon thy lot to the end of the days.
