{1:1} A man as in the land of Uz, Job his name; and that man was blameless and upright, and fearing God, and departing from evil.
{1:2} And seven sons and three daughters will be born to him.
{1:3} And his possession will be seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred pair of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and service exceedingly much; and that man shall be great above all the sons of the east.
{1:4} And his sons went and made a drinking in the house, a man his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
{1:5} And it will be that the days of drinking went round, and Job will send and consecrate them, and he rose early in the morning and brought up burnt-offerings for the number of them all: for Job said, Perhaps my sons sinned, and blessed God in their hearts. Thus did Job all the days.
{1:6} And the day will be and the sons of God will come to stand before God, and also the adversary will come in the midst of them.
{1:7} And Jehovah will say to the adversary, From whence wilt thou come? And the adversary will answer Jehovah, and say, From running to and fro in the earth, and from walking about in it.
{1:8} And Jehovah will say to the adversary, Didst thou set thy heart to my servant Job? for none like him in the earth; a man blameless and upright, fearing God and departing from evil.
{1:9} And the adversary will answer Jehovah and say, Did Job fear God gratuitously?
{1:10} Didst thou, not hedge about him and about his house, and about all that is to him from round about? Thou didst bless the work of his hands, and his possession spread abroad in the earth.
{1:11} But send forth now thy band and tough upon all which is to him, if he will not bless thee upon thy face.
{1:12} And Jehovah will say to the adversary, Behold, all that is to him in thy hand: only upon him thou shalt not send forth thy hand. And the adversary will go forth from the face of Jehovah.
{1:13} And the day will be and his sons and daughters will be eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the first-born:
{1:14} And a messenger came to Job; and he will say, The oxen were ploughing, and the he asses were feeding upon their hands.
{1:15} And Sheba will fall and take them; they struck the young men by the month of the sword; and only shall escape, I alone, to announce to thee.
{1:16} This one yet speaking, and this came, and he will say, The fire of God fell from the heavens, and it will burn upon the sheep and upon the young men, and it will devour them; and I shall escape, only I alone, to announce to thee.
{1:17} This one yet speaking, and this came, and he will say, The Chaldeans set three heads, and they invaded upon the camels, and they will take them, and they struck the young men with the mouth of the sword; and I shall escape, only I alone, to announce to thee.
{1:18} This yet speaking, and this came, and he will say, Thy sons and thy daughters Were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the first-born:
{1:19} And behold, a great wind came from beyond the desert, and it will touch upon the four corners of the house, and fall upon the young men, and they will die; and I shall escape, I only, to announce to thee.
{1:20} And Job will rise and rend his covering, and shave his head, and fall to the earth and worship.
{1:21} And he will say, Naked I came forth from my mother's womb, and naked shall I turn back there: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah took; the name of Jehovah shall be blessed.
{1:22} In all this Job sinned not, and gave not folly to God.
{2:1} And the day will be and the sons of God will come to stand before Jehovah, and the adversary also will come in the midst of them to stand before Jehovah.
{2:2} And Jehovah will say to the adversary, From whence wilt thou come? And the adversary will answer to Jehovah and say, From running to and fro in the earth, and from walking about in it.
{2:3} And Jehovah will say to the adversary, Didst thou set thy heart to my servant Job, that none like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and departing from evil? And yet he holding fast upon his integrity, and thou wilt stimulate me to destroy him without cause.
{2:4} And the adversary will answer Jehovah and say, Skin for skin, and all which is to a man he will give for his soul.
{2:5} But send forth now thy hand and touch upon his bone and upon his flesh, if he will not bless thee to thy face.
{2:6} And Jehovah will say to the adversary, Behold him in thy hand, but watch his soul.
{2:7} And the adversary will go forth from the face of Jehovah, and he will strike Job with an evil burning sore, from the sole of his foot even to his crown.
{2:8} And he will take to him a pot sherd to scrape himself with it, and he will sit in the midst of the ashes.
{2:9} And his wife will say to him, Yet thou art holding fast upon thine integrity: praise God and die.
{2:10} And he will say to her, According to the word of one of the foolish women thou wilt speak. Shall we also receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this. Job sinned not with his lips.
{2:11} And the three friends of Job will hear all this evil coming upon him, and they will come, a man from his place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: and they will appoint to come together to deplore for him, and to comfort him.
{2:12} And they will lift up their eyes from far off, and they knew him not, and they will lift up their voice and weep; and they will rend each his covering, and they will sprinkle dust upon their heads to the heavens.
{2:13} And they sat with him upon, the earth seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word to him: for they saw that grief was great exceedingly.
{3:1} After this Job opened his mouth, and he will curse his day.
{3:2} Job will answer and say,
{3:3} The day shall perish I shall bring forth in it, and the night said, A male was conceived.
{3:4} That day shall be darkness; God shall not search it out from above, and the light shall not shine upon it.
{3:5} Darkness shall pollute it, and the shadow of death; a cloud shall dwell upon it; the obscurations of day shall terrify it.
{3:6} That night darkness shall take it; it shall not be joined upon the days of the year; it shall not come into the number of months.
{3:7} Behold, that night shall be hard; no rejoicing shall be in it.
{3:8} They cursing the day shall curse it, they being ready to rouse up the sea monster.
{3:9} The stars of its twilight shall he dark; it shall wait for light, and none; and it shall not look upon the eyelashes of the dawn.
{3:10} Because it shut not up the doors of my belly; and shall it hide the labor of mine eyes?
{3:11} Wherefore shall I not die from the womb? and I came forth from the belly, and I shall expire.
{3:12} Why did the knees anticipate me? and wherefore the breasts that I shall suck?
{3:13} For now I lay down and I shall rest; I slept: then there will be rest to me.
{3:14} With kings and counselors of the earth building the wastes for themselves;
{3:15} Or with chiefs, gold to them, filling their houses with silver:
{3:16} Or as a hidden abortion I shall not be; as children they saw not light.
{3:17} There the unjust ceased to be angry, and the weary in strength shall rest.
{3:18} They being bound, rested together; they heard not the voice of the taskmaster.
{3:19} The little and the great, he is there; and the servant being free from his lord.
{3:20} Wherefore shall light be given to him toiling, and life to the bitter of soul?
{3:21} Waiting for death, and it is not; and they will dig more than for hidden treasures;
{3:22} Rejoicing with joy when they find the grave;
{3:23} To a man whose way was hid, and God will hedge about him?
{3:24} For my sighing will come before any bread, and my groanings shall be poured put as waters.
{3:25} For I feared a fear, and it will come upon me, and what I was afraid of will come to me.
{3:26} I was not secure, and I rested not, and I was not quiet; and trouble will come.
{4:1} And Eliphaz the Temanite will answer and say,
{4:2} Trying the word to thee shalt thou be weary? who shall be able to with hold in speaking?
{4:3} Behold, thou didst instruct many, and thou wilt strengthen the weak hands.
{4:4} Thy words will raise up the weak and thou wilt strengthen the bent knees.
{4:5} But now it shall come to thee and thou wilt be wearied; it will touch even to thee, and thou wilt tremble.
{4:6} Is not thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the integrity of thy ways?
{4:7} Remember now, who perished, he being innocent? and where were the upright cut off?
{4:8} According to what I saw, they ploughing iniquity and sowing labor shall reap it.
{4:9} By the breath of God they shall perish, and from the spirit of his anger they shall be finished.
{4:10} The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lion, and the teeth of the young lions were broken.
{4:11} The lion perished from failure of prey, and the sons of the lioness shall be scattered.
{4:12} And a word shall be brought to me by stealth, and mine ear will take a transient sound from it.
{4:13} In thoughts, from visions of the night, in the falling of deep sleep upon men,
{4:14} Fear met me, and trembling, and caused the multitude of my bones to tremble.
{4:15} And the spirit will glide before my face; the hair of my flesh will stand erect:
{4:16} It will stand, and I shall not recognize its appearance: a form before mine eyes; I shall hear stillness and a voice:
{4:17} Shall a man be just above God? If a man shall be pure above him making him?
{4:18} Behold, in his servants he will not trust, and upon his messengers he will set folly:
{4:19} Also those dwelling in houses of clay which their foundation in the dust, being crushed before the moth.
{4:20} From morning to evening they will be struck; from not setting to superintend they will perish.
{4:21} Did not their remainder in them remove? They will die, and not in wisdom.
{5:1} Call now, if there is answering thee; and to whom from the holy ones wilt thou turn?
{5:2} For to the foolish, and anger will slay, and the simple will jealousy kill.
{5:3} I saw the foolish one taking root, and suddenly I shall curse his habitation.
{5:4} His sons shall be far from salvation, and they shall be crushed in the gate, and none delivering.
{5:5} Which his harvest the hungry one will devour, and not from thorns shall they take it, and destruction gaped after their substance.
{5:6} For toil will not come forth from the dust, and labor will not spring up from the earth;
{5:7} For man shall be born to labor as the sons of the flame will lift up to fly.
{5:8} But I will seek to God, and to God set my cause:
{5:9} He did great things, and no searching; and wonders even no number:
{5:10} He gave rain upon the face of the earth, and sent waters upon the out places:
{5:11} To raise up the humbled to height; and those mourning were exalted to salvation.
{5:12} Bringing to nought the purposes of the crafty, and their hand shall not do an undertaking.
{5:13} He took the wise in their craftiness, and the counsel of the perverse was headlong.
{5:14} The days they will meet darkness, and they will grope in the noon day as night.
{5:15} And he saved the needy from the sword, from their mouth and from the band of the strong one.
{5:16} And hope will be to the poor one, and iniquity contracted her mouth.
{5:17} Behold, happy the man God shall rebuke him: and thou shalt not reject the correction of the Almighty:
{5:18} For he will cause pain, and he will bind up: he will smite and his hands will heal.
{5:19} In six straits he will deliver thee, and in seven, evil shall not touch upon thee.
{5:20} In famine he redeemed thee from death, and in war from the hands of the sword.
{5:21} In the scourge of the tongue thou shalt be hid, and thou shalt not be afraid of desolation when it shall come.
{5:22} At desolation and at hunger thou shalt laugh, and from the beasts of the earth thou shalt not fear.
{5:23} For with the stones of the field they covenant, and the beast of the field was at peace with thee.
{5:24} And thou knewest that thy tent is peace, and thou reviewedst thy dwelling, and thou shalt not sin.
{5:25} And thou knewest the multitude of thy seed, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
{5:26} Thou shalt come in old age to thy grave, as the ascending of a heap of sheaves in its time.
{5:27} Behold this, we searched it out, so it is: hear it, and know thou for thyself.
{6:1} And Job will answer and say,
{6:2} I would weighing, my anger shall be weighed, and my falls shall be lifted up in the balances together.
{6:3} For now it will be heavy above the sand of the seas: for this my words were rash.
{6:4} For the arrows of the Almighty are with me, which their anger drank up my spirit: the terrors of God will be prepared for me.
{6:5} Shall the wild ass bray at grass? if the ox will low over his provender?
{6:6} Shall that unseasoned be eaten without salt? if there is taste in purslain slime?
{6:7} My soul refused to touch these as the loathsomeness of my bread.
{6:8} Who will give my asking shall come? and will God give my expectation?
{6:9} And God will, and he will crush me; will he let his hand remain, and will he cut me off?
{6:10} And it will yet be my consolation, and I shall exult in pain: he will not spare; for I hid not the words of of the Holy One.
{6:11} For what my strength that I shall wait and what my end, that I shall prolong my soul?
{6:12} If my strength the strength of stones? if my flesh of brass?
{6:13} And if not my help in me? and deliverance fled from me?
{6:14} To him melting, mercy from his friend; and he will forsake the fear of the Almighty.
{6:15} My brethren dealt faithlessly as a torrent; as a channel of torrents they shall pass away;
{6:16} Being darkened because of ice, upon them the snow will be hid:
{6:17} In the time they will flow of they became extinct: in its heat they were extinguished from their place.
{6:18} The paths of their way will turn aside; they will go up into desolation and perish.
{6:19} Behold the paths of Tema; the goings of Sheba, wait ye for them.
{6:20} They were ashamed for trusting; they came even to it, they will be put to shame.
{6:21} For now ye were not: ye shall see the terror and be afraid.
{6:22} For did I say, Give to me? and from your strength make ye a present for me?
{6:23} And deliver me from the hand of the enemy? and from the hand of the strong ye shall redeem me?
{6:24} each ye me, and I will be silent: and what I erred in, cause me to understand.
{6:25} How forcible were words of uprightness! and what will reproving from you prove?
{6:26} Will ye purpose to reprove words, and for the spirit of the words of him despairing?
{6:27} But ye will cause the orphans to fall, and ye will dig for your friend.
{6:28} And now be content, look upon me; and before your face if I shall lie;
{6:29} Turn ye back now, it shall not be iniquity; and turn back yet, my justice is in it.
{6:30} Is there iniquity in my tongue? if my palate shall not understand calamities.
{7:1} Is there not warfare to man upon the earth, and his days as the days of a hireling?
{7:2} As the servant will gape for the shadow, and as the hireling will wait for his work:
{7:3} So was I caused to possess to me months of vanity, and nights of toil were allotted to me.
{7:4} If I lay down, and I said, When shall I arise, and the evening be measured? And I was filled with tossings even to the twilight.
{7:5} And my flesh was clothed with worms, and a clod of dust; my akin was contracted and melted away.
{7:6} My days were swift above a weaver's shuttle, and will finish with no more of hope.
{7:7} Remember that my life is wind: mine eyes shall not turn back to see good.
{7:8} The eye of him seeing me shall not look after me: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.
{7:9} The cloud will end and will go away: thus he shall go down to hades and shall not come up.
{7:10} He shall turn back no more to his house, and his place shall know him no more.
{7:11} Also I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the straitness of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
{7:12} Am I the sea, or a dragon, that thou wilt set a watch over me?
{7:13} For I said, My bed shall comfort me; my couch shall lift up in my complaint;
{7:14} And thou didst terrify me with dreams, and thou wilt make me afraid with visions:
{7:15} And my soul will choose strangling; death rather than my bones.
{7:16} I melted away; I shall not live forever: desist from me, for my days are vanity.
{7:17} What is man that thou wilt magnify him? and that thou wilt set thy heart to him?
{7:18} And thou wilt review him for the mornings, and thou wilt try him for the moments.
{7:19} How long wilt thou not look away from me? wilt thou not desist from me even to my swallowing down my spittle?
{7:20} I sinned; what shall I do to thee, guarding men? wherefore didst thou set me for an assault to thee, and I shall be upon myself for a burden?
{7:21} And why wilt thou not lift up my transgression and pass over mine iniquity? for now I shall lie down to the dust; and thou soughtest me and I was not.
{8:1} And Bildad the Shuhite will answer and say,
{8:2} How long wilt thou speak these things? and the great spirit of the words of thy mouth?
{8:3} Will God pervert judgment? and if the Almighty will pervert justice?
{8:4} If thy sons sinned to him, and he will send them away by the hand of their transgression;
{8:5} If thou shalt seek to God, if thou shalt make supplication to him;
{8:6} If thou wert pure and upright, for now he will awake for thee and requite the habitation of thy justice.
{8:7} And thy beginning was small, and thy latter state shall increase greatly.
{8:8} For ask now to the first generation, and prepare to seek their fathers:
{8:9} (For yesterday are we and we shall not know, for our days upon earth are a shadow:)
{8:10} Shall they not teach thee, and say to thee, and bring forth words from their heart?
{8:11} Shall the bulrush lift itself up without a marsh? shall the marsh grass grow without water?
{8:12} While yet in its greenness it shall not break off, and it will dry up before grass.
{8:13} So the paths of all forgetting God and the hope of the profane one shall perish.
{8:14} Which his hope shall be cut off, and the spider's house his trust.
{8:15} He shall lean upon his house and it shall not stand: he shall hold fast upon it, and it shall not rise up.
{8:16} It was moist before the sun, and its sprout will come forth upon his garden.
{8:17} His roots were entwined upon a heap, he shall see a house of stones.
{8:18} If he should swallow him down from his place, and it lied upon it: I saw thee not.
{8:19} Behold, this the rejoicing of his way, and from the dust shall they cause another to grow.
{8:20} Behold, God will not reject the blameless one, and he will not take hold upon the hand of those doing evil:
{8:21} Till he shall fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with shouts of joy.
{8:22} They hating thee shall put on shame; and the tent of the unjust shall not be.
{9:1} And Job will answer and say,
{9:2} I knew that so the truth: and how shall man be just with God?
{9:3} If he shall desire to contend with him, he shall not answer him one from a thousand.
{9:4} Wise of heart and strong of power: who was hard before him and shall be requited?
{9:5} Removing the mountains and they knew not: who overturned them in his anger;
{9:6} Moving the earth from her place, and her pillars will tremble;
{9:7} Saying to the sun, and it shall not rise; and for the stars he will seal them up.
{9:8} He alone spread out the heavens and he trod upon the heights of the sea.
{9:9} He made Ash-Chesil and Cimah, and the chambers of the south;
{9:10} He did great things even not searched out; and wonders even no number.
{9:11} Behold, he will pass by me, and I shall not see: and he will glide on and I shall not understand for him.
{9:12} Behold, he will catch and who shall turn him? and who shall say to him, What wilt thou do?
{9:13} God will not turn back his anger, the helpers of pride bowed down under him.
{9:14} How much less shall I answer him, shall I choose my words with him?
{9:15} Whom, if I was just, I shall not answer; I will make supplication to my judge.
{9:16} If I called and he will answer me, I shall not believe that he will give ear to my voice.
{9:17} Who will assail me with tempest, and he multiplied my wounds without cause.
{9:18} He will not give me to draw in my spirit, for he will fill me with bitterness.
{9:19} If for strength, behold him strong: if for judgment, who shall arraign me.
{9:20} If I shall be just, my mouth shall condemn me: I am blameless, and he will declare me perverse.
{9:21} I am blameless, I shall not know my soul: I shall despise my life.
{9:22} It is one: for this, I said, The blameless one and the unjust one he finishes.
{9:23} If the scourge shall fall suddenly, he will deride at the trial of the innocent.
{9:24} The earth was given into the hand of the unjust one: he will cover the faces of her judges; if not now, who is it?
{9:25} My days were swift above a runner: they fled, they saw not good.
{9:26} They glided along with the ships of desire: as the eagle will pounce upon food.
{9:27} If my saying, I will forget my complaint, I will let go my face, and I will be cheerful:
{9:28} I was afraid of all my pains, I knew that thou wilt not acquit me.
{9:29} Shall I do evil, wherefore this shall I labor in vain?
{9:30} If I washed myself in snow-water, and cleansed my hands clean;
{9:31} Then thou wilt immerse me in the ditch, and my garments abhorred me.
{9:32} For not a man as I; I shall answer him, we shall come together in judgment.
{9:33} There is not between us a reprover; he will put his hand upon us two.
{9:34} He will take away his rod from me, and his truth shall not make me afraid.
{9:35} I will speak, and I shall not fear him; but not so am I with myself.
{10:1} My soul was weary in my life; I shall leave upon me my complaint; I shall speak in the bitterness of my soul.
{10:2} Saying to God, Thou wilt not condemn me; make known to me for what thou wilt contend with me.
{10:3} Is it good to thee that thou wilt oppress, that thou wilt despise the labor of thy hinds, and thou didst shine upon the counsels of the unjust?
{10:4} Were eyes of flesh to thee? or wilt thou see as man saw?
{10:5} Are thy days as man's days? or thy years as the days of man?
{10:6} That thou wilt seek for mine iniquity, and wilt search out for my sins?
{10:7} Upon thy knowledge that I will not do evil; and none delivering from thy hand.
{10:8} Thy hands formed me, and they will work me together round about; and thou wilt swallow me down.
{10:9} Remember now, thou didst make me as day; and thou wilt turn me back to dust.
{10:10} Wilt thou not weigh me out as milk, and coagulate me as cheese?
{10:11} Thou wilt clothe me with skin and flesh, and thou wilt hedge me with bones and sinews.
{10:12} Thou didst with me life and mercy, and thy reviewing watched my spirit.
{10:13} And these thou didst hide in thy heart: I knew that this is with thee.
{10:14} If I sinned; and thou didst watch me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.
{10:15} If I did evil, wo to me; and was I just, I shall not lift up my head, being filled with dishonor: and see thou mine affliction;
{10:16} And shall it be lifted up? Thou wilt hunt me as the lion, and thou wilt turn back, thou wilt show thyself wonderful upon me.
{10:17} Thou wilt renew thy testimonies before me, and thou wilt increase thy wrath upon me; changes and war with me.
{10:18} And wherefore didst thou bring Me forth from the belly? I shall expire, and eye shall not see me.
{10:19} I shall be as I was not; I shall be brought from the womb to the grave.
{10:20} Is it not my days few? He will cease; he will turn from me, and I shall be cheerful a little,
{10:21} Before I shall go and turn back to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;
{10:22} A land of darkness, as thick darkness; of the shadow of death, and not orders, and the brightness, as thick darkness.
{11:1} And Zophar the Naamathite will answer and say,
{11:2} Shall not the multitude of words be answered? and shall a man of lips be justified?
{11:3} Shall thy empty talks cause men to be silent? and wilt thou deride and none making ashamed?
{11:4} And thou wilt say, My instruction is pure, and I was clean in thine eyes.
{11:5} And who Will give God speaking, and he will open his lips with thee?
{11:6} And he shall announce to thee hidden things of wisdom, for they are the double for understanding. And know thou that God will set to thee from thine iniquity.
{11:7} Searching shalt thou and God? Shalt thou find the Almighty even to completeness?
{11:8} The heavens being high, what wilt thou do? Hades being deep, what wilt thou know?
{11:9} Its measure long above the earth, and broad above the sea.
{11:10} If he shall pass on, and shut up, and gather together, who shall turn him back.
{11:11} For he knew men of vanity, and he will see iniquity; and will he not understand?
{11:12} And man being empty will be without heart: and man will be born a wild ass's colt.
{11:13} If thou preparedst thy heart, and didst spread thy hands towards him;
{11:14} If iniquity in thy hand, remove it far off, and wickedness shall not dwell in thy tents.
{11:15} For then thou shalt lift up thy face from spot; and thou wert firm, and thou shalt not fear:
{11:16} For thou shalt forget toil, then shalt remember as waters they passed away.
{11:17} And life shall rise above the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
{11:18} And thou didst trust, for there is hope; and thou didst search out; thou shalt lie down confidently.
{11:19} And thou shalt lie down and none terrifying; and many waited for thy face.
{11:20} And the eyes of the unjust shall be consumed, and flight shall perish from them, and their hope a breathing out of the soul.
{12:1} And Job will answer and say,
{12:2} Verily that ye are the people, and shall wisdom die with you?
{12:3} Also to me a heart like you; I fall not more than you: and with whom not like these?
{12:4} I shall be he laughing at his neighbor, calling to God, and he will answer him: the just blameless one being laughed at.
{12:5} To misfortune is contempt to the thoughts of him at ease, being prepared for the waverings of the foot.
{12:6} The tents to those oppressing will be secure, and confidence to those provoking God to anger: whom God will bring into his hand.
{12:7} But ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee; and the birds of the heavens, and they shall announce to thee:
{12:8} Or speak to the earth and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall recount to thee.
{12:9} Who knew not in all these that the hand of God did this?
{12:10} Which in his hand the soul of all living, and the spirit of all the flesh of man.
{12:11} Shall not the ear try words? and the palate shall taste food to it?
{12:12} With old men is wisdom, and length of days, understanding.
{12:13} With him wisdom and strength, to him counsel and understanding.
{12:14} Behold, he will pull down and it shall not be built up: he will shut up against man and it shall not be opened.
{12:15} Behold, he will hold back upon the waters, and they will dry up: and he will send them forth and they will overturn the earth.
{12:16} With him strength and purpose: to him the one led astray and him leading astray.
{12:17} Leading away counselors stripped off and he will make foolish the judges.
{12:18} He loosed the bonds of kings, and he will gird upon their loins a girdle.
{12:19} Leading away priests stripped off, and he will overthrow the mighty.
{12:20} Removing the lip to the faithful, and he will take discernment of old men.
{12:21} Proving contempt upon nobles, and he slackened the girdle of the strong.
{12:22} Revealing deep things from darkness, and he will bring to light the shadow of death.
{12:23} Making great to the nations, and he will destroy them: he spread out to the nations, and he will guide them.
{12:24} Taking away the heart of the heads of the people of the earth, and he will cause them to wander in a waste, not a way.
{12:25} They will feel darkness and not light, and he will cause them to wander as one intoxicated.
{13:1} Behold all mine eye saw, and mine ear heard, and it will understand for it.
{13:2} According to your knowledge I knew also: I fall not more than you.
{13:3} But I will speak to the Almighty; I shall delight to plead before God.
{13:4} And on the contrary, ye devise falsehood; physicians all of you for nothing.
{13:5} Who will give silence? Ye shall be silent, and it shall be to you for wisdom.
{13:6} Hear now my proof, and attend to the pleadings of my lips.
{13:7} Will ye speak wickedness for God? and will ye speak deceit to him?
{13:8} Will ye accept his face? will ye contend for God?
{13:9} Is it good that he shall search you out? or as he mocking against a man; will ye mock against him?
{13:10} Reproving, he will reprove you if in secret ye lift up faces.
{13:11} Shall not his majesty make you afraid? and his terror fall upon you?
{13:12} Your remembrances being likened to ashes, your backs to backs of clay.
{13:13} Be silent from me and I will speak what shall pass upon me.
{13:14} For what shall I lift up my flesh in my teeth, and shall I put my soul in my hand?
{13:15} If he shall slay me shall I not hope? only I will prove my ways to his face.
{13:16} Also he is to me for salvation for a profane one shall not come before him.
{13:17} Hearing, hear ye my words, and my declaration in your ears.
{13:18} Behold now I set in order judgment; I knew that I shall be justified.
{13:19} Who is he will contend with me? for now shall I be silent and expire;
{13:20} Only two things thou wilt not do with me: then I shall not hide from thy face.
{13:21} Remove thy hand far from me, and thy terror shall not make me afraid.
{13:22} And call and I will answer, and I shall speak, and turn thou to me.
{13:23} How many iniquities and sins to me? make known to me my transgression and my sin.
{13:24} Why wilt thou hide thy face, and reckon me for an enemy to thee?
{13:25} Wilt thou terrify the scattered leaf? and wilt thou pursue the dry straw?
{13:26} For thou wilt write bitter things against me; and thou wilt give me to inherit the iniquities of my youth.
{13:27} And thou wilt set my feet in the stocks, and thou wilt watch all my paths; thou wilt dig round the roots of my feet.
{13:28} And he as rottenness will fall away; as a garment the moth ate it.
{14:1} Man being born of woman is short of days and full of disquiet.
{14:2} And as a flower he will come forth, and will be cut down: and he will flee as a shadow, and shall not stand.
{14:3} Also upon this one didst thou open thine eyes? and wilt thou bring Me into judgment with thee?
{14:4} For who shall give a clean thing from an unclean? Not one.
{14:5} If his days are determined, the number of his months with thee; thou madest his limit; he shall not pass over.
{14:6} Look away from him and be shall cease, till he shall delight as an hireling in his day.
{14:7} For there is hope for a tree if it shall be cut down, and it shall yet revive, and its suckers shall not cease.
{14:8} If its root shall grow old in the earth, and its trunk shall die in the dust.
{14:9} From the smell of water it will break forth, and make foliage as a plant.
{14:10} And man will die and be weak: and man will expire, and where is he?
{14:11} The waters departed from the sea, and the river will be wasted and dried up;
{14:12} And man lay down and he will not rise: till the heavens be no more they shall not awake and rise from their sleep.
{14:13} Who will give thou wilt hide me in hades? wilt thou cover me till the turning away of thine anger? wilt thou set for me a limit, and wilt thou remember me?
{14:14} If a man die, shall he live? All the days of my warfare I will wait till the coming of my change.
{14:15} Thou shalt call and I will answer thee: thou wilt long for the work of thy hands.
{14:16} For now thou wilt count my steps: wilt thou not watch over my sin?
{14:17} My transgression is sealed up in a purse, and thou wilt patch upon mine iniquity.
{14:18} And yet the mountain falling shill decay, and the rock shall be removed from its place.
{14:19} The waters rubbed the stones: thou wilt overflow the flowings of the dust of the earth; and thou didst destroy the hope of man.
{14:20} Thou wilt overpower him forever, and he will go away: changing his face, thou wilt send him away.
{14:21} His sons will be honored and he knew not: they will be brought low, and he will not understand for them.
{14:22} But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul upon him shall mourn.
{15:1} And Eli-Phaz the Temanite will answer and say,
{15:2} Shall a wise one answer knowledge of wind, and fill his belly with the east wind?
{15:3} Reproving with words he shall not profit, and speeches will be of no use in them.
{15:4} Also thou wilt bring to nought, fear, and thou wilt withhold meditation before God.
{15:5} For thy mouth will accustom itself to thine iniquity, and thou wilt choose the tongue of the crafty.
{15:6} Thy mouth will condemn thee, and not I: and thy lips will testify against thee.
{15:7} Shalt thou be the firm man born? and hadst thou a beginning before the hills?
{15:8} Shalt thou hear in the consultation of God? and wilt thou reserve wisdom to thyself?
{15:9} What knewest thou and we shall not know? wilt thou understand and it not be with us?
{15:10} Also the gray headed and old man with us, great of days above thy fathers.
{15:11} Is it small with thee the consolations of God? and a word covered with thee?
{15:12} Why shall thy heart take thee? and why shall thine eyes wink?
{15:13} That thou wilt turn thy spirit against God, and thou broughtest words from thy mouth?
{15:14} What is man that he will be clean? and that he will be just, being born of woman?
{15:15} Behold, in his holy ones he will, not trust; and the heavens were not clean in his eyes.
{15:16} How much more abominable and corrupt is man drinking iniquity as water!
{15:17} I will show thee, hear to me; and that I saw I will recount;
{15:18} Which the wise ones will announce, and he hid it not from their fathers.
{15:19} To them alone the earth was given, and a stranger passed not in the midst of them.
{15:20} All the days the unjust one himself being pained, and numbering the years they were hidden to him terrifying.
{15:21} The voice of fears in his ears: in peace he destroying shall come upon him.
{15:22} He will not believe to turn back from darkness, and he was waited for by the sword.
{15:23} He wandered about for bread, where he knew that the day of darkness was ready at his hand.
{15:24} Straitness and distress shall terrify him; they shall overpower him as a king ready for war.
{15:25} For he stretched forth his hand against God, and he will strengthen himself against the Almighty.
{15:26} He will run against him upon the neck, upon the thicknesses of his shields:
{15:27} For he covered his face with his fat, and he will make fatness upon the flank.
{15:28} And he will dwell in cities out off, the houses shall not be inhabited by them, which were ready for heaps.
{15:29} He shall not be rich, and his wealth shall not rise up; their possession shall not extend upon the earth.
{15:30} He shall not depart from darkness; the flame shall dry up his suckers, and by the breath of his mouth shall he depart.
{15:31} He being deceived shall not trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his compensation.
{15:32} Before his day it shall be completed, and his branch was not green.
{15:33} He will shake off as a vine his unripe grapes, and he will cast his flower as the olive.
{15:34} For the assembly of the profane is hard, and fire consumed the tents of the gift.
{15:35} He conceiving trouble and he bringing forth vanity, and their belly shall prepare deceit.
{16:1} And Job will answer and say,
{16:2} I heard many like there: comforters of vexation ye all.
{16:3} Was there an end to words of wind? or what will provoke thee that thou wilt answer?
{16:4} Also I will speak as you: if it is your soul instead of my soul, I will join together with words against you, and shake my head against you upon it.
{16:5} I will strengthen you with my month, the moving of my lips shall hold back.
{16:6} If I shall speak, my pain will not be held back, and shall I cease, what will go from me?
{16:7} But now he made me weary: thou hast made desolate all mine assembly.
{16:8} Thou wilt lay fast hold on me to be for a testimony, and my leanness will rise up in me; it will answer against my face.
{16:9} He rent in his anger, and he will lie in wait for me, gnashing upon me with his teeth; mine enemy will sharpen his eyes against me.
{16:10} They gaped upon me with their mouth; with reproach they struck upon my cheek; they will fill out together against me.
{16:11} God will shut me up to the evil one, and he will cast me into the hands of the unjust.
{16:12} I was secure, and he will break me in pieces: and he seized upon my neck and he will disperse me, and he will set me up to him for a mark:
{16:13} His multitudes will surround upon me, he will cleave my reins asunder, and not spare; he will pour my gall upon the earth.
{16:14} He will break me, breaking upon the face of breaking; he will run upon me as the strong one.
{16:15} I sewed together sackcloth upon my skin, and I thrust my horn into the dust.
{16:16} My face became red from weeping, and upon my eye-lashes the shadow of death.
{16:17} Not for violence in my hands: and my prayer is clean.
{16:18} O earth, thou wilt not cover my blood; and shall there not be place for my cry?
{16:19} Also now, behold, my witness in the heavens, and my testimony in the heights.
{16:20} My friends mocking me: to God mine eye wept.
{16:21} Shall he judge for a man with God? and the son of man for his neighbor?
{16:22} When years of number shall come, and the way I shall go I shall not turn back.
{17:1} My spirit being destroyed my days were extinct; the graves are for me.
{17:2} If not mockings with me? and shall not mine eye lodge in their bitterness?
{17:3} Set up now, pledge me with thee: who is he will strike for my hand?
{17:4} For thou didst hide their heart from understanding; for this thou wilt not exalt them.
{17:5} He will commence evils for a position, and the eyes of his sons shall be consumed.
{17:6} He set me for a parable of the peoples, and I shall be one spit upon to the face.
{17:7} And mine eye shall be weak from vexation, and my thoughts as a shadow all of them.
{17:8} The upright shall be astonished upon this, and the innocent Shall arouse himself against the profane.
{17:9} And the just shall hold on his way, and the clean one of hands shall add strength.
{17:10} But ye all shall turn back, and come ye now, and I shall not find a wise one among you.
{17:11} My days passed away, my purposes were broken; the possessions of my heart.
{17:12} They will set the night for day: the light being near from the face of darkness.
{17:13} If I shall wait, hades is my house: in darkness I spread my bed.
{17:14} I called to the pit: Grave, thou my father: and to the worm, My mother, and my sister.
{17:15} And where now my hope? and my hope who shall regard it?
{17:16} They shall go down to the bars of hades if together we shall go down to the dust.
{18:1} And Bildad the Shuhite will answer and say,
{18:2} How long will ye set an end to words? Ye shall understand, and afterwards we will speak.
{18:3} Wherefore were we reckoned as cattle, and were unclean in your eyes?
{18:4} He rent his soul in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed from its place?
{18:5} Also the light of the unjust shall be extinguished, and the flame of his fire shall not shine;
{18:6} The light was darkened in his tent, and his lamp shall be extinguished for him.
{18:7} The steps of his strength shall be straightened, and his counsel shall cast him down.
{18:8} For he was cast into a net by his feet, and he will go about upon latticework.
{18:9} A snare shall lay hold upon the heel, the noose shall hold fast upon him.
{18:10} His gin being hid in the earth, and his snare upon the beaten path.
{18:11} Terrors made him afraid round about, and scattered him to his feet.
{18:12} His strength shall be hunger, and destruction being prepared at his side.
{18:13} It shall devour the bars of his skin: the first-born of death shall devour his bars.
{18:14} His confidence shall be plucked out from his tent, and it shall drive him to the king of terrors.
{18:15} It shall dwell in his tent, from not to him: brimstone shall be scattered upon his dwelling.
{18:16} From underneath, his roots shall be dried up, and from above, his harvest shall be cut off.
{18:17} His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and not a name to him upon a face without.
{18:18} They shall drive him out of light into darkness, and they shall exclude him from the habitable globe.
{18:19} No offspring to him, and no progeny among his people, and not a survivor in his dwellings.
{18:20} Others were astonished at his day, and the ancient took hold on shuddering.
{18:21} Also these the dwellings of evil, and this the place of him not knowing God.
{19:1} And Job will answer and say,
{19:2} How long will ye, grieve my soul, and crush me with words?
{19:3} These ten times ye will reproach me: ye will not be ashamed, ye will injure me.
{19:4} If indeed I erred my error will lodge with me.
{19:5} If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and prove against me my reproach:
{19:6} Know ye now that God subverted me; and he folded his net about me.
{19:7} Behold, I shall cry violence, and shall I not be answered: I shall cry for help, and no judgment.
{19:8} He walled up my path and I shall not pass, and he will set darkness upon my beaten paths.
{19:9} And he put off from me my honor, and he removed the crown of my head.
{19:10} He will lay me waste round about, and I shall go: and he will remove my hope as a tree.
{19:11} And he will kindle his anger against me, and he will reckon me to him as his enemy.
{19:12} His troops shall come together and raise up their way against me, and they will encamp round about to my tent.
{19:13} He removed my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance truly turned aside from me.
{19:14} My kindred ceased, and they acquainted with me forgot me.
{19:15} They sojourning in my house and my maids, mill reckon me for a stranger: I was a foreigner in their eyes.
{19:16} I called to my servant and he will not answer; I shall entreat him with my mouth.
{19:17} My spirit was loathsome to my wife, and I entreated to the sons of my belly.
{19:18} Also children rejected me; I shall arise, and they will speak against me.
{19:19} All the men of my intimacy will abhor me, and those I loved were turned against me.
{19:20} My bone cleaved to my skin and to my flesh, and I shall escape with the skin of my teeth.
{19:21} Pity me, pity me, ye my friends, for the hand of God touched upon me.
{19:22} Why will ye pursue me as God, and will ye not be satisfied from my flesh?
{19:23} Who will give now, and my words shall be written? who will give and they shall be delineated in a book?
{19:24} They shall be cut in the rock with a style of iron and lead, forever.
{19:25} And I knew he redeeming me lived, and at last he shall rise up upon the dust:
{19:26} And after they destroyed my skin, this, and from my flesh I shall see God:
{19:27} Which I shall see for myself, and mine eyes beheld, and not a stranger: my reins were finished in my bosom.
{19:28} For ye shall say, Why shall we pursue after him and the root of the word was found in me?
{19:29} And fear ye to yourselves, from the face of the sword? for wrath the iniquities of the sword, so that ye shall know there is judgment.
{20:1} And the Naainathite will answer and say,
{20:2} For this my thoughts will turn back, and because of my haste in me.
{20:3} I shall hear the instruction of my shame, and the spirit of my understanding will cause me to answer.
{20:4} Thou knewest this from everlasting when man was set upon the earth:
{20:5} For the rejoicing of the unjust drawing near, and the gladness of the profane even for a moment.
{20:6} If his elevation shall go up to the heavens, and his head shall reach to the cloud;
{20:7} As his dung he shall perish forever: they seeing him shall say, Where is he?
{20:8} As a dream he shall fly away, and they shall not find him: and he shall flee away as the vision of the night.
{20:9} The eye scanned him and shall not add; and his place shall no more look after him.
{20:10} The weak shall break his sons, and his hands shall turn back his wealth.
{20:11} His bones were full of his youth, and shall lie down with him in the dust.
{20:12} If evil shall be sweet in his mouth he will cover it under his tongue;
{20:13} He will spare over it, and forsake it not, and keep it back in the midst of his palate:
{20:14} His bread in his bowels was turned, the gall of asps in his midst.
{20:15} He swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit it up, and God shall drive it out of his belly.
{20:16} He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall kill him.
{20:17} He shall not look upon the streams, the rivers, the torrents of honey and curdled milk.
{20:18} Turning back the labor, and he shall not swallow down: according to the substance of his exchange and he shall not exult.
{20:19} For he oppressed, forsaking the poor; he stripped the house and he will not build it up.
{20:20} For he knew not tranquillity in his belly, in his desire he shall not escape.
{20:21} Nothing was left to his food; for this his good shall not be stable.
{20:22} In the fulness of his abundance it shall be pressed to him: every laboring hand shall come to him.
{20:23} He will be for filling his belly, he will send upon him the burning of his anger, and will rain upon him in his eating.
{20:24} He shall flee from the weapon of iron, the bow of brass shall pierce him.
{20:25} Being drawn it will come forth from the body; and the lightning will go from his bile, and terrors upon him.
{20:26} All darkness hid for his secret places: a fire not blown upon shall devour him; and the remaining one shall do evil upon his tent.
{20:27} The heavens shall uncover his iniquity, and the earth an adversary against him.
{20:28} The increase of his house shall be rolled off; they were poured out in the day of his anger.
{20:29} This the portion of an unjust man and the lot of his command from God.
{21:1} And Job will answer and say,
{21:2} Hearing, hear ye my speech, and this shall be your consolations.
{21:3} Suffer me and I will speak; and after my word ye will mock.
{21:4} I, is my complaint to man? and then wherefore shall not my spirit be shortened?
{21:5} Look to me and be astonished, and put the hand upon the mouth.
{21:6} And when I remembered and trembled, and horror took hold of my flesh.
{21:7} Wherefore shall the unjust live? They grew old, also they were strong in power.
{21:8} Their seed was established before their face with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
{21:9} Their houses peace from fear, and the rod of God not upon them.
{21:10} His ox passed over and will not be cast away: his heifer will escape and will not be barren.
{21:11} They will send forth their children as a flock, and their children will leap.
{21:12} They will lift up with the drum and harp, and they will rejoice at the voice of the pipe.
{21:13} Their days glided on in good, and in a moment they will lay hold of hades.
{21:14} And they will say to God, Depart from us; and we desired not the knowledge of thy ways.
{21:15} What the Almighty that we shall serve him? and what shall we be profited if we shall supplicate to him?
{21:16} Behold, their good not in the hand: the counsel of the unjust was far from me.
{21:17} How often the light of the unjust shall be extinguished, and their destruction will come upon them. He will distribute pains in his anger.
{21:18} They shall be as straw before the wind, and as chaff the storm stole it away.
{21:19} God will lay up his iniquity for his sons: he will requite to him and be shall know.
{21:20} His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink from the wrath of the Almighty.
{21:21} For what his delight in his house after him, and the number of? his months were divided out?
{21:22} Shall he teach knowledge to God? and he will judge those lifted up.
{21:23} This shall die in the strength of his fulness, altogether tranquil and at rest.
{21:24} His sides were filled with fat, and the marrow of his bones will, be moistened.
{21:25} And this will die in the soul of bitterness, and will not eat in good.
{21:26} They will lie down together upon the dust, and the worm shall cover over them.
{21:27} Behold, I knew your purposes, and the devices ye will shake off against me.
{21:28} For ye will say, Where the house of the noble one; and where the tent of the dwellings of the unjust?
{21:29} Did ye not ask them passing over the way? and shall ye not know their signs?
{21:30} For the evil one will be spared for the day of destruction; they shalt be led away to the day of wraths.
{21:31} Who shall announce his way upon his face? and who shall requite to him that he did?
{21:32} And he shall be led away to the graves, and shall watch over the tomb.
{21:33} And the clods of the valley were sweet to him, and every man shall draw after him, and before him no number.
{21:34} And how will ye comfort me in vain, and your answers remained treachery?
{22:1} And Eliphaz the Temanite will answer and say,
{22:2} Shall a man profit to God as he understanding shall profit for himself?
{22:3} Did it please to the Almighty that thou wilt be just? and if gain if thou wilt perfect thy ways?
{22:4} Will he reprove thee from thy fear? Will he go with thee into judgment?
{22:5} Is not thine evil much? and no end to thine iniquities?
{22:6} For thou wilt take a pledge of thy brethren, in vain, and the garments of the naked thou wilt strip of.
{22:7} Thou wilt not give to the weary one water to drink, and from the hungry one thou wilt withhold bread.
{22:8} And the man of arm, to him the earth; and the lifted up of face dwelt in it.
{22:9} Thou didst send away widows empty, and the arms of the orphans will be broken.
{22:10} For this, snares are round about thee, and sudden fear will terrify thee;
{22:11} Or darkness thou wilt not see; and abundance of waters shall cover thee.
{22:12} Is not God high in the heavens? and see the head of the stars for they were lifted up.
{22:13} And thou saidst How shall God know? Shall he judge in the cloud of darkness?
{22:14} Clouds a covering to him, and he will not see; and he will go about the circle of the heavens.
{22:15} Wilt thou watch the path of old which men of iniquity trod?
{22:16} Who were laid hold of, and no time a river will pour out their foundation?
{22:17} They saying to God, Depart from us: and what shall the Almighty do for them?
{22:18} And he filled their houses with good: and the counsel of the unjust was far from me.
{22:19} The just shall see and shall be glad: and the innocent shall deride at them.
{22:20} If our adversaries were not destroyed, and their remnant the fire shall devour.
{22:21} Be acquainted now with him, and be safe: by them shall good come to thee.
{22:22} Take now the law from his mouth, and set his words in thy heart.
{22:23} If thou wilt turn back even to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt remove iniquity far off from thy tent.
{22:24} Place thou gold upon the dust, and the precious ore of the torrents of Ophir.
{22:25} And the Almighty was thy gold and silver of labors to thee.
{22:26} For then upon the Almighty shalt thou delight thyself, and thou shalt lift up thy face to God.
{22:27} And thou shalt pray to him, and he will hear thee, and thou shalt repay thy vows.
{22:28} And thou shalt decide the word, and it shall be set up to thee: and the light shone upon thy ways.
{22:29} For they were humbled, and thou wilt say, A lifting up; and he will save him depressed of eyes.
{22:30} He will deliver the island of the innocent: and it was delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
{23:1} And Job will answer and say,
{23:2} Also today is my complaint bitter: my hand heavy over my groaning,
{23:3} Who will give, I knew to find him: I will come even to his place.
{23:4} I will arrange judgment before him, and I will fill the mouth with proofs.
{23:5} I shall know the words he will answer me, and I shall understand what he will say to me.
{23:6} Will he contend with me in great power? No; but he will put in me.
{23:7} There the upright one disputed with him; and I shall be delivered forever from my judge.
{23:8} Behold, I shall go before, and he is not; and behind, I shall not understand for him.
{23:9} The left hand in his working, and I shall not behold: he will cover himself on the right hand, and I shall not see.
{23:10} For he knew the way with me: he tried me; I shall come forth as gold.
{23:11} My foot laid hold upon his going, I watched his way and not softly.
{23:12} From the command of his lips and I will not waver; from his law I hid the words of his mouth.
{23:13} And he is in one, and who shall turn him back? and his soul desired, and he will do.
{23:14} For he will finish my appointing: and many such with him.
{23:15} For this I shall tremble from his face: I shall consider, and I shall be afraid of him.
{23:16} God relaxed my heart, and the Almighty caused me to tremble.
{23:17} For I was not cut off from the face of darkness, and he covered misfortune from my face.
{24:1} Wherefore were not times hidden from the Almighty? and they knowing him saw not his days.
{24:2} They will remove the bound; they will strip off the flock, and they will feed.
{24:3} They will lead away the ass of the orphans, and they will take for pledge, the widow's ox.
{24:4} They will turn the needy from the Way: the poor of the earth hid themselves together.
{24:5} Behold, wild asses in the desert will go forth in their work, seeking for prey: the sterile region bread for him, and for the young.
{24:6} In the field they will harvest his meslin, and they will glean the vintage of the unjust one.
{24:7} They will cause the naked to lodge without clothing, and no covering in the cold.
{24:8} They will be wet from the pouring rains of the mountains, and they embraced the rock from no shelter.
{24:9} They will strip the orphan from the breast, and take a pledge for the poor.
{24:10} They caused the naked to go without clothing, and from the hungry they took away the sheaf;
{24:11} Between their walls they will press out oil; they trod their wine-presses, and they will thirst.
{24:12} From the city men will groan, and the soul of the wounded will cry out: and God will not set folly.
{24:13} They were among the rebels of light; they knew not his ways, and they dwelt not in his beaten paths.
{24:14} The murderer will rise by light; he will kill the poor and needy; and in the night he will be as a thief.
{24:15} And the eye of the adulterer watched the twilight, saying, Eye shall not perceive me: and secretly he will set the face.
{24:16} To break through houses in darkness in the day they shut up for themselves: they knew not light.
{24:17} For the morning altogether to them the shadow of death: if it shall be known, the terrors of the shadow of death.
{24:18} He is swift upon the face of the waters; their portion will be cursed in the earth: he will not see the way of the vineyards.
{24:19} Dryness, also heat, will strip the snow waters: hades him sinning.
{24:20} The womb shall forget him; the worm sucked him; he shall be no more remembered: and iniquity shall be broken as a tree.
{24:21} He did evil to the barren; she will not bear: and he will not do good to the widow.
{24:22} And he drew the mighty in his power: he will rise up and none shall be sure in living.
{24:23} It will he given to him for confidence, and he will rest upon: and his eyes upon their ways.
{24:24} They were lifted up a little while, and they are not, and they were brought low; as all they will be drawn together, and as the head of an ear of grain they shall be cut off.
{24:25} And if not now, who will cause me to lie, and set my words for nought?
{25:1} And Bildad the Shuhite will answer and say,
{25:2} Dominion and fear with him; he made peace in his heights.
{25:3} Is there a number to his troops? and upon whom shall not his light arise?
{25:4} And how shall man be justified with God? and how shall he born of woman be clean?
{25:5} Behold even to the moon, and it shall not shine; and the stars were not clean in his eyes.
{25:6} How much less man, a worm; and the son of man, a worm.
{26:1} And Job will answer and say,
{26:2} How didst thou help to him of no strength? didst thou save the arm of no strength?
{26:3} How didst thou counsel to him of no wisdom? and didst thou make known help for abundance?
{26:4} And with whom didst thou announce words? and whose breath came forth from thee?
{26:5} The shades shall tremble from under the waters, and their inhabitants.
{26:6} Hades is naked before him, and no covering to destruction.
{26:7} He stretched out the north upon emptiness, he hung up the earth upon nothing.
{26:8} He bound up the waters in his clouds, and the cloud was not rent under them.
{26:9} Holding fast the face of the throne, he spread his cloud upon it.
{26:10} He marked out with a compass the law upon the face of the waters, even till the end of light with darkness.
{26:11} The pillars of the heavens shall be shaken, and be astonished from his reproof.
{26:12} By his power he caused the sea to tremble; by his understanding he smote through pride.
{26:13} By his spirit he polished the heavens; his hand pierced the flat serpent.
{26:14} Behold these the ends of his ways; how transient a sound of the word was heard in him! and the thunder of his might who shall understand?
{27:1} And Job will add to take up his parable, and say,
{27:2} God lives, he removed my judgment; and the Almighty embittered my soul;
{27:3} For all the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God in my nose;
{27:4} If my lips shall speak iniquity, and my tongue if it shall murmur deceit.
{27:5} Far be it to me if I shall justify you: till I expire I will not remove my integrity from me.
{27:6} My justice I held fast, and I will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach from my days.
{27:7} Mine enemy shall be as the unjust one, and he rising up against me, as the evil one.
{27:8} For what the hope of the profane one if he shall plunder? for God shall draw out his soul.
{27:9} Will God hear his cry when straits shall come upon him?
{27:10} If he will delight himself upon the Almighty? will he call upon God in all time?
{27:11} I will teach you by the hand of God: what is with the Almighty I will not hide.
{27:12} Behold, all ye yourselves saw; and wherefore this, will ye breathe out vanity?
{27:13} This the portion of an unjust man with God, and the inheritance of the terrible they shall take from the Almighty.
{27:14} If his sons shall be multiplied, for then the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
{27:15} His surviving one shall be buried in death, and his widows shall not weep.
{27:16} If he shall heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing as clay;
{27:17} He shall prepare, and the just shall put on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
{27:18} He built his house as the moth, and as a booth he watching made.
{27:19} The rich one shall lie down, and he shall not be gathered: he opened his eyes, and he is not.
{27:20} Terrors shall hedge him about as waters, the night a tempest stole him away.
{27:21} The east wind shall lift him up, and he shall go: and it shall sweep him away in storm from his place.
{27:22} For he shall cast upon him and not spare: fleeing, he will flee from his hand.
{27:23} It shall be clapped upon him with their hands, and it shall be hissed upon him from his place.
{28:1} For there is a going forth for silver, and a place for gold they will purify it.
{28:2} Iron shall be taken from the dust, and stone will pour out brass.
{28:3} He set an end to darkness, and he searched out for all completeness: the stone of darkness and the shadow of death.
{28:4} The torrent broke out from the sojourner; being forgotten of the foot, they were weak, they wandered from men.
{28:5} The earth, from it will come forth bread, and under it was turned as fire.
{28:6} Its stones the place of the sapphire, and dust gold to it.
{28:7} A beaten path the birds knew not, and the vulture's eye scanned it not:
{28:8} The sons of pride trod it not, and the lion passed not by upon it.
{28:9} He stretched forth his hand upon the flint; he overturned the mountains from the roots.
{28:10} He cut rivers in the rocks, and his eye saw every precious thing.
{28:11} He bound the rivers from weeping, and he will bring forth the hidden thing to light.
{28:12} And from whence shall wisdom be found? and where this place of understanding?
{28:13} And man knew not its estimation, and it shall not be found in the land of the living.
{28:14} The depth said, It is not in me: and the sea said, Not with me.
{28:15} Shut up gold shall not be given for it, and silver shall not be weighed its price.
{28:16} It shall not be weighed with gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, and the sapphire.
{28:17} Gold and crystal shall not compare with it, and its exchange, vessels of pure gold.
{28:18} High things, and crystal, shall not be remembered: and the drawing out of wisdom above pearls.
{28:19} The topaz of Cush shall not compare with it; with pure gold it shall not be weighed.
{28:20} And from whence shall wisdom come? and where this place of understanding?
{28:21} And being hid from the eyes of all living, and covered from the birds of the heavens.
{28:22} Destruction and death said, We heard its report with our ears:
{28:23} God understood its way, and he knew its place.
{28:24} For he will look to the ends of the earth, he will see under all the heavens;
{28:25} To make the weight for the wind; and he weighed the waters by measure.
{28:26} In his making a law for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the voices.
{28:27} Then he saw, and he will recount it; he prepared it, and also he searched it out.
{28:28} And he will say to man, Behold, the fear of Jehovah, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
{29:1} And Job will add to lift up his parable, and say,
{29:2} Who will give me as the months of old, as the days God will watch me?
{29:3} In his causing his light to shine upon my head, before his light I shall go through darkness;
{29:4} As I was in the days of my ripeness, in the intercourse of God upon my tent;
{29:5} In the Almighty being yet with me, my youths round about me;
{29:6} In washing my goings with butter, and the rock will pour out with me streams of oil;
{29:7} In my going forth to the gate upon the city, in the street I shall prepare my seat.
{29:8} The young men saw me and hid themselves, and the old men rose up and stood.
{29:9} Chiefs held back in words, and they will put the hand to the mouth.
{29:10} The voice the leaders hid, and their tongue was joined to their palate.
{29:11} If the ear heard, and it will pronounce me happy; and the eye saw, and it will testify to me:
{29:12} For I shall deliver the poor crying, and the orphan, and none helping to him.
{29:13} The praise of him perishing will come upon me, and I shall cause the heart of the widow to rejoice.
{29:14} I put on justice and it will clothe me: my judgment as an upper garment and a turban.
{29:15} Eyes was I to the blind one, and feet to the lame was I.
{29:16} I was a father to the needy, and the contention I knew not I shall search it out.
{29:17} And I shall break the biter's teeth of the evil one, and I shall cast the prey from his teeth.
{29:18} And saying, I shall expire with my nest I shall multiply days as the sand.
{29:19} My root opened to the waters, and the dew will lodge upon my foliage.
{29:20} My glory new with me, and my bow will be changed in my hand.
{29:21} To me they heard, and they waited, and they will be silent for them at my counsel.
{29:22} After my words they will not repeat, and my speech will drop upon them.
{29:23} And they waited for me as the rain, and they opened wide their mouth for the latter rain.
{29:24} I shall laugh at them, they will not believe; and the light of my face they will not cast down.
{29:25} I shall choose their way, and I shall sit the head, and I shall dwell as king in the troop, as he shall comfort those mourning.
{30:1} And now the younger than I laughed upon me, which I rejected their fathers to set with the dogs of my flock.
{30:2} Also the strength of their hands wherefore to me? Upon them old age perished.
{30:3} In want and in hunger, barren, gnawing the dry land, yesternight desolation and burning.
{30:4} Plucking off sea purslain upon the shrub, the root of broom their bread.
{30:5} They shall be driven forth from the midst, they shall cry after them as a thief:
{30:6} To dwell in the horror of the valleys, holes of the dust, and the rocks.
{30:7} Between the shrubs they will bray; they will be poured out under the thorn bush.
{30:8} The sons of the foolish one, also the sons of no name: they were beaten from the land.
{30:9} And now I was their song, and I to them for a by word.
{30:10} They abhorred me, they removed far from me, and withheld not spittle from my face.
{30:11} Because he loosed his cord and he will afflict me, and they cast off the bridle from before me.
{30:12} Upon the right the brood will rise up; they cast away my feet, and they will cast up the paths of their destruction against me.
{30:13} They tore up my beaten path, they helped for my fall, no help to them.
{30:14} They will come as a wide breach under a destroying tempest, they rolled themselves.
{30:15} Terror turned upon me, it will pursue my willingness as the wind, and my salvation passed away as a cloud.
{30:16} And now my soul shall be poured out upon me; and the days of affliction will hold me fast.
{30:17} The night my bones pierced from above me, and my gnawers will not lie down.
{30:18} By the multitude of power my clothing will be disguised: it will gird me about as the mouth of my coat.
{30:19} He cast me to the clay; I shall become like as dust and ashes.
{30:20} I shall cry to thee and thou wilt not answer me: I stood up and thou wilt not attend to me.
{30:21} Thou wilt turn to be cruel to me: with the strength of thy hand thou wilt lie in wait for me.
{30:22} Thou wilt lift me up to the wind; thou wilt cause me to ride, and thou wilt melt to me counsel.
{30:23} For I knew thou wilt turn me back to death, and the house appointed to all living.
{30:24} But prayer is nothing; he will send forth the hand, if in his calamity to them a cry for help.
{30:25} If I wept not for him being hard of day: my soul was grieved for the needy.
{30:26} For I hoped for good and evil will come: and I shall wait for light and darkness will come.
{30:27} My bowels boiled, and were not silent: the days of affliction anticipated me.
{30:28} I went darkened without warmth: I rose up, I shall cry in the convocation.
{30:29} I was a brother to jackals, and a companion to the daughters of the ostrich.
{30:30} My skin was black from above me, and my bones burnt from heat.
{30:31} And my harp will be for mourning, and my pipe for the voice of those weeping.
{31:1} I cut out a covenant for mine eyes; and why shall I show myself attentive to a virgin?
{31:2} And what the portion of God from above? and the inheritance of the Almighty from the heights?
{31:3} Is not destruction to the evil one? and strangeness to those working iniquity?
{31:4} Will he not see my way, and number all my steps?
{31:5} If I went with vanity, and my foot will haste upon deceit;
{31:6} He shall weigh me in balances of justice, and God will know mine integrity.
{31:7} If my going will incline from the way, and my heart went after mine eyes, and a blemish did cleave upon my hands:
{31:8} I will sow and another shall eat; and my offspring shall be rooted up.
{31:9} If my heart was seduced by woman, and I laid wait at the door of my neighbor;
{31:10} My wife shall grind for another, and others shall bow down upon her.
{31:11} For this is crime, and this is iniquity for the judges.
{31:12} For it is a fire; it will devour even to destruction, and will root out upon all mine increase.
{31:13} If I shall despise the judgment of my servant and my maid in their contending with me;
{31:14} And what shall I do when God shall rise up? And when he shall review, what shall I turn back to him?
{31:15} Did not he making me in the womb, make him? And he will prepare us in one belly.
{31:16} If I shall withhold from the desire of the poor, and cause the eyes of the widow to fail;
{31:17} And eating my morsel alone, and the orphan ate not from it;
{31:18} (For from my youth he grew up to me as a father, and I shall guide her from my mother's womb;)
{31:19} If I shall see one perishing from not being clothed, and no covering to the needy;
{31:20} If his loins did not praise me, and he will be warmed from the fleece of my sheep.
{31:21} If I lifted up my hand against the orphan when I shall see, my help in the gate:
{31:22} My shoulder shall fall from its shoulder-blade, and mine, arm shall be broken from the bone.
{31:23} For the destruction of God is a terror to me, and from his lifting up I shall not prevail.
{31:24} If I set gold my hope, and said to gold, My trust;
{31:25} If I shall rejoice because of the Multitude of my riches, and because my hand found much;
{31:26} If I shall see the light when it shall shine, and the moon going in splendor;
{31:27} And my heart will be seduced in secret, and my hand shall kiss to my mouth:
{31:28} Also this an iniquity for the judges: for I lied to God from above.
{31:29} If I shall rejoice in the destruction of him hating me, and I exalted when evil found him:
{31:30} And I gave not my palate to sin to ask in cursing his soul.
{31:31} If the men of my tent said not, Who will give from his flesh? We shall not be satisfied.
{31:32} The stranger shall not lodge without: I shall open my doors to the traveler.
{31:33} If I covered my transgression, as man, to hide mine iniquity in my bosom:
{31:34} If I, shall fear a great multitude, and the contempt of families terrify me, and I will be silent and not go out of my door.
{31:35} Who will give to me hearing to me? Behold, my sign, the Almighty will answer me, and the man contending with me wrote a book.
{31:36} If not, I shall lift it up upon my shoulder, I will bind it a crown to me.
{31:37} The number of my steps I shall announce to him: as a leader I shall draw near to him.
{31:38} If my land shall cry against me, and its, furrows shall weep together;
{31:39} If I ate its strength without silver, and caused its possessors to expire:
{31:40} The thorn shall come forth, instead of wheat, and the weed instead of barley. The words of Job were completed.
{32:1} And these three men will cease from answering Job, for he is just in his eyes.
{32:2} And the anger of Elihu will kindle, son of Barachel the Buzite, from the family of Ram: against Job was, his anger kindled, for his justifying his soul above God.
{32:3} And against his three friends was his anger kindled, because they, found not an answer, and they will condemn Job.
{32:4} And Elihu waited for Job in words, for they were old for days above him.
{32:5} And Elihu will see that not an Answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger will kindle,
{32:6} And Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite will answer and say, I few for days, and ye old men; for this I was afraid, and I shall fear showing you my knowledge.
{32:7} I said, days shall speak, and multitude of years shall make known wisdom.
{32:8} But it is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty will cause them to understand.
{32:9} Not the many will be wise: and old men understand judgment.
{32:10} For this, I said, Hear to me; I also will show my knowledge.
{32:11} Behold, I waited for your words, giving ear even to your understandings while ye will search out words.
{32:12} And I will show myself attentive even to you, and behold, none from you confuting to Job, answering his words.
{32:13} Lest ye shall say, We found wisdom: God will thrust him, not man.
{32:14} And he arranged not words against me: and I will not turn back to him with your words.
{32:15} They were confounded; they answered no more: they removed words from themselves.
{32:16} And I waited, (for they will not speak, for they stood, they answered no more:)
{32:17} I also will answer my part, I also will show my knowledge.
{32:18} For I was filled with words, the spirit of my belly pressed upon me.
{32:19} Behold, my belly as wine it will not open; it will break open as new wine skins.
{32:20} I will speak, and it will breathe to me: I will open my lips and answer.
{32:21} Not now shall I lift up the face of man, and I shall not flatter to man.
{32:22} For I knew not, shall I flatter; for a little while, he making me will take me away.
{33:1} And yet hear now, O Job, my speech, and give ear to all my words.
{33:2} Behold, now, I opened my mouth, my tongue spake in my palate.
{33:3} My sayings the uprightness of my heart, and my lips spake knowledge purely.
{33:4} The spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty will cause me to live.
{33:5} If thou shalt be able to turn back to me, set in order before me, stand forth.
{33:6} Behold, I am according to thy mouth for God: from clay was I also broken off.
{33:7} Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, and my hand shall not be heavy upon thee.
{33:8} Surely thou spakest in mine ear and I will hear the voice of thy words.
{33:9} I am clean without transgression; I am fair, and no iniquity to me.
{33:10} Behold, he will find enmity against me, and he will reckon me for an enemy to him.
{33:11} He will set my feet in the stocks, he will watch all my paths.
{33:12} Behold, this thou wert not just: I will answer thee, for God will be great above man.
{33:13} Wherefore didst thou contend against him? for he will not answer all his words.
{33:14} For God will speak at once, and at a second time, and he shall not regard it.
{33:15} In a dream, in a vision of the night, in the falling of deep sleep upon men, in slumbers upon the bed;
{33:16} Then he will uncover the ear of men, and will seal in their instruction,
{33:17} To remove man from working, and he will bide pride from man.
{33:18} He will keep back his soul from the pit, and his life from passing away by the spear.
{33:19} And he was chastened with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones perpetually.
{33:20} His life loathed bread, and his soul food of desire.
{33:21} His flesh will consume away from seeing, and they saw not the nakedness of his bones.
{33:22} And his soul will draw near to the pit, and his life to the dead.
{33:23} If there is a messenger upon him, an interpreter, one from a thousand, to announce to man his uprightness:
{33:24} And he will compassionate him and say, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I found an expiation.
{33:25} His flesh revived above a youth: he shall turn back to the days of his childhood.
{33:26} He shall pray to God and he shall receive him into favor: and he shall see his face with rejoicing, and he will turn back to man his justice.
{33:27} He will look upon men, and he shall say, I sinned, and I perverted the right, and it was not fitting to me;
{33:28} Redeem my soul from passing into the pit, and my life shall look upon light.
{33:29} Behold, all these God will work twice, thrice, with man,
{33:30} To turn back his soul from the pit, to enlighten with the light of the living.
{33:31} Attend, O Job, hear to me: be silent and I will speak.
{33:32} If there be words, turn back to me: speak, for I desired to justify thee.
{33:33} If not, hear thou to me: be silent, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
{34:1} And Elihu will answer and say,
{34:2} Hear, ye wise, my words; and ye knowing, give ear to me.
{34:3} For the ear will try words, and the palate will taste of food.
{34:4} We will choose to us judgment: we shall know between ourselves what is good.
{34:5} For Job said, I was just: and God removed my judgment.
{34:6} Shall I speak falsehood against my judgment? mine arrow was desperate without transgression.
{34:7} What man as Job he will drink scoffing as water?
{34:8} Going for company with those working iniquity, and to go with men of injustice?
{34:9} For he said, It will not profit a man in delighting himself with God.
{34:10} For this, ye men of heart, hear to me: far be it to God from doing evil; and the Almighty from iniquity.
{34:11} For the work of man shall he recompense to him, and a man shall find himself according to his way.
{34:12} Also surely God will not do evil, and the Almighty will not pervert judgment.
{34:13} Who committed to him the earth? and who set up the habitable globe all of it?
{34:14} If he will set his heart to him, he will gather his spirit and his breath to him;
{34:15} All flesh shall expire together, and man shall turn back to dust.
{34:16} If now understanding, hear this: give ear to the voice of my words.
{34:17} Also shall he hating judgment, rule? and if thou wilt condemn the just mighty one?
{34:18} Saying to the king, Wickedness; (Belial) to nobles, Injustice.
{34:19} Who accepted not the face of chiefs, and looked not upon the rich one before the poor: for his hand made all of them.
{34:20} In a moment shall they die, and the middle of the night shall the people be moved and pass away: and the mighty shall be removed with not a hand.
{34:21} For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he will see all his steps.
{34:22} Not darkness and not the shadow of death for those working iniquity to hide there.
{34:23} For he will not yet set upon man to go to God in judgment.
{34:24} He shall break in pieces the mighty, not searching out, and he will set others in their stead.
{34:25} For this he will know their work, and he turned the night, and they will be crushed.
{34:26} He struck them for the unjust in the place of those seeing;
{34:27} Who therefore turned away from after him, and they consider not all his ways,
{34:28} To cause the cry of the poor one to come to him, and he will hear the cry of the humble.
{34:29} And he will give quiet, and who shall disturb? and he will hide the face, and who shall look upon him? and against a nation and against man wholly:
{34:30} From the reigning of the profane man from the people being snared.
{34:31} For he said to God, I was lifted up, I will pervert no more.
{34:32} Besides I shall see thou wilt teach it to me: if I did iniquity, I will not add.
{34:33} Is it with thee? he will requite it, if thou didst refuse, if thou shalt choose, and not I: and what thou knewest, speak.
{34:34} Men of heart will say to me, and a wise man heard to me.
{34:35} Job will speak not with knowledge, and his word not with understanding.
{34:36} My father, Job shall be tried even to the end, for turning back with men of iniquity.
{34:37} He will add rebellion to his sin; he will clap between us, and he will multiply his words to God.
{35:1} And Elihu will answer and say,
{35:2} Didst thou reckon this for judgment thou saidst, My justice is above God?
{35:3} For thou wilt say, What shall it profit to thee? what shall I profit from my sin?
{35:4} I will turn back words to thee, and thy companions with thee.
{35:5} Look upon the heavens and see; behold the clouds, they were high above thee.
{35:6} If thou sinnedst, what wilt thou do against him? and thy transgressions were multiplied, what wilt thou do to him?
{35:7} If thou wert just, what wilt thou give to him? or what shall he take from thy hand?
{35:8} Thy injustice to a man as thou: and thy justice to the son of man.
{35:9} From the multitude of oppressions they will cry out: they will cry out from the arm of the many.
{35:10} And not saying, Where is God making me? he gave songs in the night.
{35:11} And who teacheth us from the cattle of the earth, and he will make us wise above the birds of the heavens?
{35:12} Then they will cry, and he will not answer from the face of the pride of the evil.
{35:13} Also God will not hear vanity, and the Almighty will not look upon it.
{35:14} Also if thou shalt say thou wilt not see him, judgment is before him, and thou shalt wait for him.
{35:15} And now that it is not, he reviewed his anger, and he knew not in great transgression.
{35:16} And Job will open his mouth in vain; he will bind together words without knowledge.
{36:1} And Elihu will add and say,
{36:2} Wait for me a little, and I will show thee, for yet words for God.
{36:3} I will lift up my knowledge from far off, and to him making me, I will give justice.
{36:4} For truly my words are not falsehood: the perfect of knowledge with thee.
{36:5} Behold, God is mighty, and he will not despise: mighty in strength of heart.
{36:6} He will not save alive the unjust one, and he will give the judgment of the poor.
{36:7} He will not take off his eyes from the just: and with kings upon the throne, and he will seat them for glory, and they shall be exalted.
{36:8} And they being bound in fetters shall be taken in the cords of affliction.
{36:9} And he will announce to them their work, and their transgressions, for they will be strong.
{36:10} And he will uncover their ear for instruction, and he will say that they shall turn back from iniquity.
{36:11} If they will hear and will serve him, they shall finish their days in good, and their years in delights.
{36:12} And if they will not hear, they shall pass away by the spear, and they shall expire without knowledge.
{36:13} And the profane of heart shall set up anger: they will not cry if he bound them.
{36:14} Their soul will die in youth, and their life among the consecrated.
{36:15} He will deliver the poor one in his affliction, and he will uncover their ear in oppression.
{36:16} And also he moved thee from the mouth of the enemy to a broad, not straight place; and thy table came down full of fatness.
{36:17} And thou didst fill up the judgment of the unjust one; judgment and right shall hold together.
{36:18} Because of wrath, lest he shall remove thee with smiting, and a multitude of covering shall not turn thee away.
{36:19} Will he value thy riches? not gold and all the powers of thy strength.
{36:20} Thou shalt not pant after the night, for taking up peoples in their place.
{36:21} Watch thyself; thou shalt not turn to iniquity: for upon this thou didst choose rather than affliction.
{36:22} Behold, God will exalt by his power: who teaches like him?
{36:23} Who charged upon him his way? and who said, Thou didst iniquity?
{36:24} Remember that thou shalt magnify his work which men beheld.
{36:25} Every man looked upon it; man shall see from far off.
{36:26} Behold, God is great, and we shall not know the number of his years, and it was not searched out.
{36:27} For he will withhold the drops of water: they will pour out rain for its vapor.
{36:28} Which the clouds will shake out; they will drop an abundance upon man.
{36:29} Also if he shall understand the spreadings of the cloud, the noise of his booth.
{36:30} Behold, he spread upon it his light, and he covered the roots of the sea.
{36:31} For by them he will judge the peoples; he will give food to abundance.
{36:32} With the hands be covered the light; and he commanded concerning it with a mark.
{36:33} His thunder will announce concerning him, and the flock also concerning the going up.
{37:1} Also at this my heart shall tremble, and it will leap from its place.
{37:2} Hearing, hear ye, to the noise of his voice, and the growling going out from his mouth.
{37:3} He will let it go free under all the heavens, and his light upon the wings of the earth.
{37:4} After him a voice shall rear; he will thunder with the voice of his majesty: and he will not leave them behind when his voice shall be heard.
{37:5} God will thunder with his voice of wonder, doing great things, and we shall not know.
{37:6} For he will say to the snow, Be it on earth; and to the shower of rain, and to the shower of the rains of his strength.
{37:7} He will seal in the hand of every man, for all men to know his work.
{37:8} And the beast shall go into the covert, and shall dwell in its habitation.
{37:9} From the chamber shall come forth the whirlwind, and cold from the scatterings.
{37:10} From the breath of God ice will be given, and the breadth of the waters in being straitened.
{37:11} Also by watering he will cast down the cloud: he will scatter the cloud of his light:
{37:12} Being turned by his guidance to their doing all that he commanded them upon the face of the habitable globe of the earth.
{37:13} If for the rod, if for his land, if for mercy, it shall find him.
{37:14} Give ear to this, O Job: stand and consider the wonders of God.
{37:15} Shalt thou know in God's setting upon them, and he caused the light of his cloud to shine?
{37:16} Shalt thou know upon the poisings of the cloud, the wonders of the complete of knowledges?
{37:17} That thy garments are warm in quieting the earth from the south?
{37:18} Wilt thou spread out with him to the clouds, strong as the sight of a melted mass?
{37:19} Make known to us what we shall say to him we shall not set in order from the face of darkness.
{37:20} Shall it be recounted to him that I shall speak? If a man spake, then shall he be swallowed down.
{37:21} And now they saw not the bright light that is in the clouds: and the wind passed over and it will cleanse them.
{37:22} From the north, gold shall come: upon God terrible majesty.
{37:23} The Almighty we found not: great of power and judgment, and much justice, he will not afflict.
{37:24} For this, men shall fear him: he will not see all the wise of heart.
{38:1} And Jehovah will answer Job from the whirlwind, and he will say,
{38:2} Who this darkening counsel in words without knowledge?
{38:3} Gird now thy loins as a man; and I will ask thee, and make thou known to me.
{38:4} Where wert thou in my founding the earth? Announce, if thou knewest understanding.
{38:5} Who set its measures, if thou shalt know? or who stretched the line upon it?
{38:6} Upon what were its bases impressed? or who placed its corner-stone?
{38:7} In the rejoicing together of the stars of morning, and all the sons of God will shout for joy?
{38:8} And he will hedge in the sea with doors in its breaking forth, going forth from the womb.
{38:9} In my making the cloud its garment, and darkness its bandage:
{38:10} And I shall break upon it my law, and I shall set bars and doors;
{38:11} And saying, Even to this shalt thou come, and thou shalt not add: and here in the pride of thy waves, stand thou.
{38:12} In thy days didst thou command the morning? and didst thou make the dawning know its place?
{38:13} To take hold upon the wings of the earth, and the unjust shall be shaken out of it?
{38:14} It shall be turned as clay to the seal; and they shall stand as clothing.
{38:15} And their light shall be withheld from the unjust, and the high arm shall be broken.
{38:16} Didst thou go even to the fountains of the sea? and didst thou go about in searching the depth?
{38:17} Were the gates of death uncovered to thee? and shalt thou see the gates of the shadow of death?
{38:18} Wilt thou consider even to the breadth of the earth? Announce if thou knewest all of it.
{38:19} Where the way light shall dwell? and darkness, where its place?
{38:20} That thou shalt take it to its bound, and that thou shalt understand the beaten paths of its house?
{38:21} Knewest thou? for shalt thou then be born, and the number of thy days great?
{38:22} Didst thou come into the treasures of snow? and shalt thou see the treasures of hail,
{38:23} Which I kept back for the time of straits, for the day of encounter and war?
{38:24} Where that way the light will divide, it will scatter the east wind upon the earth?
{38:25} Who divided a channel for the overflowing, and a way for the lightning of the voices?
{38:26} To cause it to rain upon the earth, not a man; the wilderness not a man in it?
{38:27} To satisfy the desolation and burning, and to cause the springing up of the finding of the tender grass?
{38:28} Is there a father to the rain? or who begat the reservoirs of the dew?
{38:29} From whose womb came forth the ice? and the hoarfrost of the heavens, who brought it forth?
{38:30} The waters shall be hid as a stone, and the face of the depth will be taken.
{38:31} Wilt thou bind the bands of the cluster, or wilt thou open the cords of Orion?
{38:32} Wilt thou bring forth the twelve signs in its time? and the great bear and his sons, wilt thou guide them?
{38:33} Knewest thou the laws of the heavens? or wilt thou set up its dominion in the earth?
{38:34} Wilt thou lift up thy voice to the cloud, and abundance of waters shall cover thee?
{38:35} Shalt thou send lightnings, and shall they go and shall they say to thee, Behold us?
{38:36} Who put wisdom in the reins? or who gave understanding to the mind?
{38:37} Who shall number the clouds in wisdom? and who shall cause the bottles of heaven to lie down?
{38:38} In the pouring out of the dust into a melted mass, and the clods will adhere.
{38:39} Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? and wilt thou fill up the life of the young lions?
{38:40} For they will sink down in the dwellings; they will dwell in the thicket to lie in wait.
{38:41} Who will prepare for the raven his food? for his young will cry to God; they will wander without food.
{39:1} Knewest thou the time of the bringing forth of the wild goats of the rock? and wilt thou watch the bearing of the hinds?
{39:2} Wilt thou number the months they shall fill up? and didst thou know the time of their bringing forth?
{39:3} They will bow, they will bring forth their children, they will cast forth their pains.
{39:4} Their sons will be fat, they will increase with grain; they will go forth and not turn back to them.
{39:5} Who sent the wild ass free? and who opened the bonds of the wild ass?
{39:6} To whom did I set the desert his house, and the salt land his dwellings?
{39:7} He will laugh at the multitude of the city; he will not hear the noise of him driving.
{39:8} The searching out of the mountains his pasture, and he will seek after every green thing.
{39:9} Will the buffalo be willing to serve thee, or will he lodge by thy stall?
{39:10} Wilt thou bind the buffalo in the furrow with cords, or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
{39:11} Wilt thou trust in him because great his strength? and wilt thou leave to him thy labor?
{39:12} Wilt thou believe in him that he will turn back thy seed and gather to thy threshing-floor?
{39:13} The wings of ostriches exulted; and the wing-feather of the stork and the pinion.
{39:14} For she will leave her eggs to the earth, and she will warm them in the dust;
{39:15} And she will forget that the foot will press it, and the beast of the field will crush it.
{39:16} She made hard to her sons as not to her: her labor in vain without fear;
{39:17} For God caused her to forget wisdom, and he divided not to her in understanding.
{39:18} For the time she will lash herself up upon height, she will laugh at the horse and at his rider.
{39:19} Wilt thou give strength to the horse? wilt thou clothe his neck with thunder?
{39:20} Wilt thou cause him to tremble as the locust? the glory of his snorting is terror.
{39:21} They will dig in the valley, and he will rejoice in strength: he will go forth to the meeting of the weapon.
{39:22} He will laugh at fear, and he will not be dismayed; and he will not turn back from the face of the sword.
{39:23} The quiver will give forth a whizzing against him, the flame of the spear and the javelin.
{39:24} With leaping and rage he will swallow the earth; and he will not believe that it is the voice of the trumpet.
{39:25} He will say according to the multitude of the trumpet, Aha! and he will smell the battle from far off, the thunder of the chiefs, and the war cry.
{39:26} From thy understanding will the hawk mount upwards? will it stretch its wings to the south?
{39:27} If at thy mouth the eagle will lift itself up, and if it will raise up its nest?
{39:28} She will dwell in the rock, and she will lodge upon the cliff of the rock and the fortress.
{39:29} From thence it sought food; far off shall its eyes behold.
{39:30} Her young shall suck up the blood: and where the wounded, there is she.
{40:1} And Jehovah will answer Job, and he will say,
{40:2} Shall he contending with the Almighty, instruct? he reproving God shall answer it.
{40:3} And Job will answer Jehovah, and say,
{40:4} Behold, I was vile; what shall I turn back to thee? I put my hand to my mouth.
{40:5} Once I sake, and I will not answer: and twice, and I will not add.
{40:6} And Jehovah will answer Job from the whirlwind, and he will say,
{40:7} Gird up now thy loins as a man; I will ask thee, and do thou make known to me.
{40:8} Wilt thou also annul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me so that thou shalt be just?
{40:9} And if an arm to thee as God? and with thy voice wilt thou thunder as he?
{40:10} Deck thyself now with majesty and grandeur, and thou shalt put on ornament and splendor.
{40:11} Scatter the overflowings of thine anger, and see every proud one and bring him low.
{40:12} See every proud one, and humble him; and crush the unjust in their place.
{40:13} Hide them in the dust together, and bind their faces in hiding.
{40:14} And also I will confess to thee that thy right hand shall save for thee.
{40:15} Behold now, the great beast which I made with thee; he will eat grass as an ox.
{40:16} Behold now, his strength in his loins, and his power in the sinews of his belly.
{40:17} He will bend his tail as a cedar; the sinews of his thighs will be woven together.
{40:18} His bones tubes of brass; his bones as a hammered bar of iron.
{40:19} He the chief of the ways of God: he making him, his sword will reach.
{40:20} For the mountains shall lift up produce for him, and all the beasts of the field shall play there.
{40:21} He will lie down under the shades, in the covering of the reed and marsh.
{40:22} The shades shall cover him with their shadow; the willows of the torrent shall surround him.
{40:23} Behold, he will oppress a river, and he will not spring up: he will trust that Jordan burst forth into his mouth.
{40:24} He will take it with his eyes: his nose will pierce through snares.
{41:1} Wilt thou draw out the crocodile with a hook and with a cord wilt thou press down his tongue?
{41:2} Wilt thou put a rope in his nose? and wilt thou hollow out his jaw with a thorn?
{41:3} Will he multiply supplications to thee? will he speak soft things to thee?
{41:4} Will he cut out a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant forever?
{41:5} Wilt thou play with him as a bird? and wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
{41:6} Shall companions give a feast upon him? shall they divide him between the Canaanites?
{41:7} Wilt thou fill his skin with pointed weapons? and his head with fish spears?
{41:8} Put thy hand upon him; remember the battle, thou shalt not add.
{41:9} Behold, his hope was false: shall he not be cast down at his sight?
{41:10} None fierce that he will rouse him up: and who is he will stand before me?
{41:11} Who anticipated me, and I will recompense? under all the heavens it is to me.
{41:12} I will not be silent for him, and the word of powers and the beauty of his preparation.
{41:13} Who uncovered the face of his clothing? who shall come with his double bridle?
{41:14} Who opened the doors of his face? his teeth a terror round about.
{41:15} Pride of strong shields shut up with a seal of straitness.
{41:16} One shall touch upon another, and the wind shall not come between them.
{41:17} They will adhere each in his brotherhood, they will hold together, and they will not be separated.
{41:18} His sneezings a light will shine, and his eyes as the eyelashes of the dawning of day.
{41:19} From his mouth flaming torches shall go forth; sparks of fire will escape.
{41:20} From his nostrils smoke will come forth as a blown pot, and a caldron.
{41:21} His soul will kindle coals, and a flame will go forth from his mouth.
{41:22} In his neck will lodge strength, and terror will leap before him.
{41:23} The flaps of his flesh adhered: it will press upon him; it will not be moved.
{41:24} His heart will press as a stone; and it will press as the under millstone.
{41:25} His lifting up, the mighty will be stirred up: from breaking they shall purify themselves.
{41:26} The sword reaching him, shall not be raised up: the spear, the dart, and the coat of mail.
{41:27} He will reckon iron for straw, and brass for wood of rottenness.
{41:28} The son of the bow shall not cause him to flee: sling-stones were turned to him for stubble.
{41:29} The bludgeon was reckoned to him for stubble: and he will laugh at the shaking of the javelin.
{41:30} Sharpnesses of the potsherd under him: he will spread a trench upon the mire.
{41:31} He will cause the deep to boil as a pot: he will set the sea as ointment.
{41:32} He will cause a beaten path to shine after him: the deep will be reckoned to be hoary.
{41:33} None upon the dust being like him; he made him without fear.
{41:34} He will see every thing high: he is king over all the sons of pride.
{42:1} And Job will answer Jehovah, and he will say,
{42:2} I knew that thou wilt be able to do all, and counsel shall not be restrained from thee.
{42:3} Who this hiding counsel without knowledge? for this, I announced, and I shall not understand; wonders above me, and I shall not know.
{42:4} Hear, now, and I will speak: I will ask thee and make thou known to me.
{42:5} By the hearing of the ear I heard of thee: and now mine eyes saw thee:
{42:6} For this, I shall melt away, and I lamented in dust and ashes.
{42:7} And it will be after Jehovah spake these words to Job, and Jehovah will say to Eliphaz the Temanite, Mine anger was kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye spake not the right before me as my servant Job.
{42:8} And now take to you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and bring up a burnt-offering for yourselves; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for his face I will accept, so as not to do with you for folly, for ye spake not to me the right as my servant Job.
{42:9} And Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, Zophar the Naamathite, will go, and they will do according as God Jehovah spake: and Jehovah will accept the face of Job.
{42:10} And Jehovah turned back the captivity of Job in his praying for his friends: and Jehovah added all which was to Job, to the double.
{42:11} And there will come to him all his brethren and all his sisters, and all knowing him before; and they will eat bread with him in his house: and they will deplore for him, and they will comfort him upon all the evil which Jehovah brought upon him: and they will give to him each one weight, and each one ring of gold.
{42:12} And Jehovah blessed the latter state of Job more than his beginning: and there will be to him fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.
{42:13} And there will be to him seven sons and three daughters.
{42:14} And he will call the name of the one, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-Happuch.
{42:15} And women were not found fair as the daughters of Job, in all the land: and their father will give to them an inheritance in the midst of their brethren.
{42:16} And Job will live after this a hundred and forty years, and he will see his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations.
{42:17} And Job will die, old and full of days.
