{1:1} The lifting up the word of Jehovah to Israel by the hand of Malachi.
{1:2} I loved you, said Jehovah. And ye said, In what didst thou love us? Was not Esau brother to Jacob? says Jehovah: and loving Jacob.
{1:3} And I hated Esau, and I will set his mountains a desolation, and his inheritance for the jackals of the desert.
{1:4} For Edom will say, We were broken down, and we will turn back and build the wastes; thus said Jehovah of armies: They shall build and I will pull down; and calling to them, The bound of injustice, and, The people with whom Jehovah was very angry, even to forever.
{1:5} And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, Jehovah will be magnified from above to the bound of Israel.
{1:6} A son will honor the father, and the servant his lord; and if I a father, where mine honor? and if I their lord, where my fear? said Jehovah of armies to you, O priests despising my name. And ye said, In what did we despise thy name?
{1:7} Bringing polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye said, In what did we pollute thee? In your saying, The table of Jehovah it was despised.
{1:8} And if ye shall bring near the blind for a sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye shall bring near the lame and the sick, is it not evil? bring A near now to thy governor; will he delight in thee, or lift up thy face? said Jehovah of armies.
{1:9} And now, beseech now, the face of God, and he will be gracious to us: this was from your hand: will he lift up from you the faces? says Jehovah of armies.
{1:10} Who also among you and he will shut the doors? and ye shall not make light mine altar gratuitously. Not to me delight in you, said Jehovah of armies, and I will not delight in the gift of your hand.
{1:11} For from the rising of the sun and even to its going down, great my name among the nations; and in every place incense being brought to my name, and a clean gift: for great my name among the nations, said Jehovah of armies.
{1:12} And ye profaning it in your saying, The table of Jehovah it being polluted; and its fruit, its food was despised.
{1:13} And ye said, Behold, what a weariness! and ye puffed at it, said Jehovah of armies; and ye brought the spoiled and the lame, and the sick; and ye brought the gift: shall I accept it from your hand? said Jehovah.
{1:14} And cursed he deceiving, and there is in his flock a male, and he vowed and sacrificed a corrupt thing to Jehovah: for I am a great king, said Jehovah of armies, and my name terrible among the nations.
{2:1} And now to you this command, O ye priests.
{2:2} If ye will not hear and if ye will not set upon your heart to give honor to my name, said Jehovah of armies, and I sent a curse upon you, and I cursed your blessings, and also I cursed it for your not setting upon the heart.
{2:3} Behold me rebuking the seed to you, and I scattered dung upon your faces, the dung of your festivals; and it lifted you up to it.
{2:4} And ye knew that I sent this command to you, for my covenant to be with Levi, said Jehovah of armies.
{2:5} My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I will give them to him fearing, and he shall fear me, and from the face of my name he was terrified.
{2:6} The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: in truth and in uprightness he went with me, and he turned back many from iniquity.
{2:7} For the lips of the priest shall watch knowledge, and they shall seek the law from his mouth: for he is the messenger of Jehovah of armies.
{2:8} And ye departed out of the way; ye made many weak by the law; ye corrupted the covenant of Levi, said Jehovah of armies.
{2:9} And also I set you despised and low to all the people, according as ye watch not my way, and lift up the face against the law.
{2:10} Is there not one father to us all? is there not one God creating us? wherefore shall we deal faithlessly each against his brother, to profane the covenant of our fathers?
{2:11} Judah dealt faithlessly, and an abomination was done in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah profaned the holy place of Jehovah which he loved, and married the daughter of a strange god.
{2:12} Jehovah will cut off to the man which shall do it, him waking, and him answering from the tents of Jacob, and him bringing near a gift to Jehovah of armies.
{2:13} And this ye will do the second time, covering with tears the altar of Jehovah, with weepings and shrieks, from not any more looking to the gift, and to take delight from your hand.
{2:14} And ye said, For what? For that Jehovah testified between thee and between the wife of thy youth, which thou didst deal faithlessly against her, and she thy companion and the wife of thy covenant.
{2:15} And did he not make one? And the remainder of the spirit to him. And why one? Seeking a seed of God. And ye matched in your spirit, and he shall not deal faithlessly against the wife of thy youth.
{2:16} For he hated sending away, says Jehovah God of Israel: and he covered violence with his clothing, said Jehovah of armies: and ye watched in your spirit, and ye shall not deal faithlessly.
{2:17} Ye wearied Jehovah with your words: and ye said, In what did we weary? In your saying, Every one doing evil is good in the eyes of Jehovah, and he delighted in them; or, Where the God of judgment?
{3:1} Behold me sending my messenger, and he looked upon the way before my face: and suddenly Jehovah whom ye seek shall come to his temple, and the messenger of the covenant whom ye delight in: behold him coming, said Jehovah of armies.
{3:2} And who enduring the day of his coming? and who standing in his being seen? for he is as the fire of the crucible, as the alkali of the fuller.
{3:3} And he sat melting and cleansing silver: and he cleansed the sons of Levi, and he purified them as gold and as silver, and they were to Jehovah bringing near the sacrifice in justice.
{3:4} And the sacrifice of Judah and Jerusalem was pleasant to Jehovah, as the days of old and as the former years.
{3:5} And I came near to you for judgment: and I was a swift witness against those practicing magic, and against those committing adultery, and against those swearing to falsehood, and against those oppressing the hire of the hireling, the widow and the orphan, and those turning aside the stranger, and they feared not me, said Jehovah of armies.
{3:6} For I am Jehovah, I changed not; and ye the sons of Jacob were not finished.
{3:7} For from the days of your fathers ye departed from my laws, and ye watched not. Turn back to me and I will turn back to you, said Jehovah of armies. And ye said, In what shall we turn back?
{3:8} Will man defraud God? For ye defraud me. And ye said, In what did we defraud thee? The tenths and the offerings.
{3:9} Ye are cursed with a curse: and ye defrauded me, the nation all of it.
{3:10} Bring ye all the tenths to the house of treasure, and food shall be in my house, and try me now in this, said Jehovah of armies, if I will not open to you the lattices of the heavens, and empty out to you a blessing, even is it not a sufficiency.
{3:11} And I rebuked upon the eater for you, and he shall not corrupt for you the fruit of the earth; and the vine in the field shall not be barren to you, says Jehovah of armies.
{3:12} And all nations pronounced you happy, for ye shall be a land of delight, said Jehovah of armies.
{3:13} Your words were strong against me, said Jehovah. And ye said, What did we speak against thee?
{3:14} Ye said, Vanity to serve God: and what profit that we watched his watches, and that we went mourning from the face of Jehovah of armies?
{3:15} And now we pronounce the proud happy; also they working injustice were built up; also they tried Jehovah and they will be delivered.
{3:16} Then they fearing Jehovah spake each to his neighbor, and Jehovah will attend and will hear, and write a book of remembrance before him for those fearing Jehovah, and for thinking upon his name.
{3:17} And they were to me, said Jehovah of armies, for the day which I make wealth; and I spared for them as a man will spare for the son serving him.
{3:18} And ye turned back and saw between the just to the unjust, and between him serving God and to him serving him not.
{4:1} For behold, the day coming, burning as a furnace; and all the proud and all doing injustice were straw: and the day coming burnt them, said Jehovah of armies, that it shall not leave to them root and branch.
{4:2} And to you fearing my name the sun of justice arose, and healing in his wings; and ye went forth and spread as calves of the stall.
{4:3} And ye tread down the unjust; for they were ashes under the soles of your feet in the day which I doing, said Jehovah of armies.
{4:4} Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel, the laws and the judgments.
{4:5} Behold, I send to you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the day of Jehovah, great and terrible:
{4:6} And he turned back the heart of the fathers to the sons, and the heart of the sons to the fathers, lest I shall come and strike the earth with utter destruction.
