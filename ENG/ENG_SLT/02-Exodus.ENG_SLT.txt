{1:1} These the names of the sons of Israel coming into Egypt with Jacob; a man and his house came.
{1:2} Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah,
{1:3} Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin,
{1:4} Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
{1:5} And these will be all the souls that came out of the thigh of Jacob, seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt.
{1:6} And Joseph will die, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
{1:7} And the sons of Israel were fruitful, and they will multiply abundantly, and they will increase, and will become strong with might exceedingly; and the land will be filled with them.
{1:8} And a new king will arise over Egypt, who will not know Joseph.
{1:9} And he will say to his people, Behold, the people of the sons of Israel, many, being strong above us.
{1:10} Come, we will be wise with them, lest they shall multiply, and it was when war shall happen, and also being added to our armies and fighting against us, and they went up from the land.
{1:11} And they will set over them leaders of the tributes in order to afflict them in their burdens. And they will build cities of stores for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses.
{1:12} And as they will afflict them, so they will multiply and will increase. And they will feel disgust from the face of the sons of Israel.
{1:13} And the Egyptians will make the sons of Israel serve by oppression.
{1:14} And they will embitter their lives by hard work in clay, and in bricks, and in all work in the field: all their work in which they made them serve by oppression.
{1:15} And the king of Egypt will say to the midwives of the Hebrews, of whom the name of the one Shiprah, and the name of the second, Puah;
{1:16} And he will say, In the delivering the Hebrew women, and seeing upon the stools, if it is a son, ye shall kill him; and if it is a daughter, preserve alive.
{1:17} And the midwives will fear God, and they did not according to what the king of Egypt said to them, and they will preserve alive the boys.
{1:18} And the king of Egypt will call to the midwives, and will say to them, Wherefore did ye this word, and ye will preserve alive the boys?
{1:19} And the midwives will say to Pharaoh, That the Hebrewesses are not as the Egyptian women, for they giving life before the midwives shall come in to them, and they will bring forth.
{1:20} And God will do well to the midwives, and the people will multiply and be greatly strong.
{1:21} And it will be because the midwives will fear God, and he will make houses for them.
{1:22} And Pharaoh will command to all the people, saying, Every son being brought forth ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall preserve alive.
{2:1} And a man from the house of Levi will go and take a daughter of Levi.
{2:2} And the woman will conceive and will bring forth a son; and she will see him that he is good, and she will hide him three months.
{2:3} And she will not be able any more to hide him, and she will take for him an ark of bulrush, and will pitch it with bitumen and with pitch, and she will put in it the child, and will put in the sedge by the lip of the river.
{2:4} And his sister will stand afar off to know what will be done to him.
{2:5} And the daughter of Pharaoh will come down to wash at the river; and her maids going by the side of the river: and she will see the ark in the midst of the sedge, and she will send her maid and she will take it.
{2:6} And she will open and will see the child: and behold, the boy weeping: And she will have pity upon him, and will say, This from the children of the Hebrews.
{2:7} And his sister will say to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse from the Hebrew women, and she will suckle the child for thee?
{2:8} And Pharaoh's daughter will say to her, Go. And she will go and call the child's mother.
{2:9} And Pharaoh's daughter will say to her, Take this child and suckle it for me, and I will give thy wages And the woman will take the child and will suckle it.
{2:10} And the child will become great, and she will bring him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he will be to her for a son. And she will call his name Moses; and she will say, Because I drew him out of the water.
{2:11} And it will be in these days, and Moses will become great, and he will go forth to his brethren, and he will see their burdens: and he will see a man, an Egyptian, smiting a man, a Hebrew, from his brethren.
{2:12} And he will turn hither and thither, and will see that there is no man, and he will smite the Egyptian, and hide him in the sand.
{2:13} And he will go forth in the second day, and behold, two men, Hebrews, (paneling; and he will say to the unjust one, For what wilt thou smite thy friend?
{2:14} And he will say, Who set thee for a chief man and judge over us? dost thou think to kill me as thou didst kill the Egyptian? and Moses will be afraid, and will say, Surely, this word was known.
{2:15} And Pharaoh will hear this word, and he will seek to kill Moses. And Moses will flee from the face of Pharaoh, and he will dwell in the land of Midian: and he will sit down by the well.
{2:16} And to the priest of Midian, seven daughters: and they will come and will draw and fill the watering troughs to water the sheep of their father.
{2:17} And the shepherds will come, and will expel them: and Moses will rise up and help them, and will water their sheep.
{2:18} And they will come to Reuel their father, and he will say, Wherefore hastened ye to come this day?
{2:19} And they will say, A man, an Egyptian, delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and also drawing, drew for us, and watered the sleep.
{2:20} And he will say to his daughters, Where is he? for what this left ye the man? call to him and he shall eat bread.
{2:21} And Moses will be contented to dwell with the man, and he will give Zipporah his daughter to Moses.
{2:22} And she will bear a son, and he will call his name Gershom; for he said, I was a sojourner in a strange land.
{2:23} And it will be in these many days, and the king of Egypt will die: and the sons of Israel will groan, from the work; and they will cry out, and their supplication will go up to God from the work.
{2:24} And God will hear their groaning, and God will remember his covenant with Abraham, with Isaak and with Jacob.
{2:25} And God will see the sons of Israel, and God will know.
{3:1} And Moses was feeding the sheep of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he will lead the sheep behind the desert, and he will come to the mountain of God, to Horeb.
{3:2} And the messenger of Jehovah will be seen to him in a flame of fire from the midst of the bramble; and he will see, and behold, the bramble burning in fire, and the bramble was not consumed.
{3:3} And Moses will say, I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bramble will not burn.
{3:4} And Jehovah will see that he turned aside to see, and God will call to him from the midst of the bramble, and he will say, Moses, Moses! And he will say, Behold me.
{3:5} And he will say, Thou shalt not draw near hither; draw off thy shoes from thy feet, for the place which thou standest upon it, this is holy land.
{3:6} And he will say, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaak and the God of Jacob. And Moses will hide his face, for he will be afraid to look to God.
{3:7} And Jehovah will say, Seeing, I saw the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I heard their cry from the face of their pressers; and I knew their pains.
{3:8} And I will come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of this land to a good and great land, to a land flowing milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites and the Jebusites.
{3:9} And now behold the cry of the sons of Israel came to me: and also I saw the oppression which the Egyptians oppressed them.
{3:10} And now come, and I will send thee to Pharaoh, and bring thou forth my people, the sons of Israel out of Egypt.
{3:11} And Moses will say to God, Who am I that I shall go to Pharaoh, and that I shall bring forth the sons of Israel, out of Egypt?
{3:12} And he will say, That I will be with thee; and this a sign to thee that I sent thee; in thy bringing forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
{3:13} And Moses will say to God, Behold me going to the sons of Israel, and I spake to them, The God of your fathers sent me to you; and they said to me, What his name? what shall I say to them?
{3:14} And God will say to Moses, I shall be that I shall be: and he will say, So shalt thou say to the sons of Israel, I Shall Be sent me to you.
{3:15} And God will yet say to Moses, Thou shalt say to the sons of Israel, Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaak and the God of Jacob, sent me to you: this my name for eternity, and this my remembrance to generation and generation.
{3:16} Come, and gather together the old men of Israel, and say to them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, was seen to me, the God of Abraham, Isaak and Jacob, saying, Reviewing, I reviewed you and what was done to you in Egypt.
{3:17} And saying, I will bring you up from the affliction of Egypt, to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.
{3:18} And they heard thy voice; and thou camest, thou and the old men of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and ye said to him, Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, met with us; and now will we go a way of three days into the desert, and we will sacrifice to Jehovah our God.
{3:19} And I knew that the king of Egypt will not give you to go and not with a strong hand.
{3:20} And I sent my hand and struck Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst: and after that he will send you forth.
{3:21} And I gave favor to this people in the eyes of the Egyptians, and it shall be when ye shall go, ye shall not go empty.
{3:22} And a woman asked of her neighbor, and of her sojourning in her house, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and clothing; and put upon your sons and upon your daughters; and ye stripped the Egyptians.
{4:1} And Moses will answer and say, And behold, they will not believe in me, and they will not bear to my voice: for they will say, Jehovah was not seen to thee.
{4:2} And Jehovah will say to him, What this in thy hand? and he will say, A rod.
{4:3} And he will say, Cast it upon the earth. And he will cast it upon the earth and it will be into a serpent, and Moses will flee from before it.
{4:4} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand, and seize by its tail. And he will stretch forth his hand, and will hold fast upon it, and it will be for a rod in his hand.
{4:5} That they shall believe that Jehovah was seen to thee, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaak, and the God of Jacob.
{4:6} And Jehovah will say to him yet again, Bring now thy hand into thy bosom. And he will bring his hand into his bosom, and he will bring it forth, and behold his hand leprous as snow.
{4:7} And he will say, Turn back thy hand into thy bosom. And he will turn back his hand into his bosom, and he will bring it forth from his bosom, and behold, it turned back as his flesh.
{4:8} And it shall be if they will not believe in thee, and will not hear to the voice of the first sign, and they believed the voice of the latter sign.
{4:9} And it shall be, if they will not believe in the two signs, and will not hear to thy voice, and take thou from the water of the river and pour out upon the dry; and the water which thou shalt take from the river shall be and shall be for blood upon the dry.
{4:10} And Moses will say to Jehovah, With leave my Lord, not a man of words, also from yesterday, also from the third day, also from the time of thy speaking to thy servant; for I being heavy of mouth, and heavy of tongue.
{4:11} And Jehovah will say to him, Who set a mouth to man? or who set the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or blind? is it not I Jehovah?
{4:12} And now go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.
{4:13} And he will say, With leave, my Lord, send by the hand thou shalt send.
{4:14} And Jehovah will be angry with anger against Moses, and he will say, Is not Aaron thy brother, the Levite? I know that speaking, he will speak. And also behold him coming forth to thy meeting: and seeing thee and rejoicing in his heart.
{4:15} And speak to him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and teach you what ye shall do.
{4:16} And he the word for thee to the people: and being, he shall be to thee for a mouth, and thou shalt be to him for God.
{4:17} And this rod shalt thou take in thy hand, with which thou shalt do signs.
{4:18} And Moses will go and turn back to Jethro his father-in-law, and will say to him, I will go now and turn back to my brethren which are in Egypt, and I will see whether they are yet living. And Jethro will say to Moses, Go in peace.
{4:19} And Jehovah will say to Moses in Midian, Go, turn back to Egypt, for all the men died having sought thy soul.
{4:20} And Moses will take his wife and his sons, and will cause them to ride upon an ass, and he will turn back to the land of Egypt And Moses will take the rod of God in his hand.
{4:21} And Jehovah will say to Moses, In thy going to turn back to Egypt, see all the wonders which I put in thy hand: do them before Pharaoh; and I will bind fast his heart and he shall not send forth the people.
{4:22} And say thou to Pharaoh, So said Jehovah, my first-born son is Israel.
{4:23} And saying to thee, Send forth my son, and he shall save me: and shalt thou refuse to send him, behold me killing thy son, thy first-born.
{4:24} And it shall be in the way in the inn, and Jehovah will meet with him and will seek to kill him.
{4:25} And Zipporah will take a stone, and will cut off the uncircumcision her son, and will come to his feet, and will say, For a spouse of bloods, thou to me.
{4:26} And he will desist from him: then she said, A husband of bloods, for the circumcision.
{4:27} And Jehovah will say to Aaron, Go to the meeting of Moses, to the desert And he will go, and will meet with him in the mount of God, and will kiss him.
{4:28} And Moses will announce to Aaron all the words of Jehovah who sent him, and all the signs which he commanded him.
{4:29} And Moses will go, and Aaron, and they will gather together all the old men of the sons of Israel.
{4:30} And Aaron will speak all the words which Jehovah spoke to Moses, and he will do the signs in the eyes of the people.
{4:31} And the people will believe: and they will hear that Jehovah reviewed the sons of Israel, and that he saw their affliction, and they will bow down and worship.
{5:1} And afterwards Moses and Aaron and they will say to Pharaoh, Thus said Jehovah, the God of Israel, Send forth my people, and they shall keep a festival to me in the desert.
{5:2} And Pharaoh will say, Who is Jehovah, whose voice I shall hear to send forth Israel? I knew not Jehovah, and also I shall not send Israel forth.
{5:3} And they will say, The God of the Hebrews called to us; we will go now a way of three days into the desert, and we will sacrifice to Jehovah our God, lest he fall upon us with death or with the sword.
{5:4} And the king of Egypt will say to them, For what Moses and Aaron, will ye let go loose the people from their works? go ye to your burdens.
{5:5} And Pharaoh will say, Behold, many now are the people of the land, and ye turned them away from their burdens.
{5:6} And Pharaoh will command in that day those urging on over the people, and their scribes, saying,
{5:7} Ye shall not gather straw to give to the people to make bricks as yesterday, and the third day: they shall go and gather straw for themselves.
{5:8} And the measure of bricks which they made yesterday and the third day, ye shall put upon them; ye shall not take away from it, for they are slack; for this they cried, saying, We will go to sacrifice to our God.
{5:9} The work shall be heavy upon the men, and they shall work in it, and they shall not look upon empty words.
{5:10} And the urgers on of the people will go forth, and the scribes, and they will speak to the people, saying, Thus said Pharaoh, I gave you not straw.
{5:11} Go ye, take straw for yourselves, from where ye shall find it; for not a word shall be taken away from your works.
{5:12} And the people will be dispersed in all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
{5:13} And the urgers on will hasten them, saying, Complete your work; the word of a day, in its day, as in there being straw.
{5:14} And the scribes of the sons of Israel will be beaten, which Pharaoh's urgers on set over them, saying, Wherefore did ye not complete your allowance of brick as yesterday and the third day, also yesterday, also this day?
{5:15} And the scribes of the sons of Israel will come in, and will cry to Pharaoh, saying, For what wilt thou do this to thy servants?
{5:16} Straw was not given to thy servants, and they said to us, Make bricks: and behold, thy servants were beaten; and the sin, thy people.
{5:17} And he will say, Ye are idle, ye are idle: for this ye said, We will go to sacrifice to Jehovah.
{5:18} And now go, work; and straw shall not be given to you, and ye shall give the measure of bricks.
{5:19} And the scribes of the sons of Israel will see themselves in evil, for saying, Ye shall not take away from the bricks the word of a day in its day.
{5:20} And they will light upon Moses and Aaron, going forth to their meeting in their coming out from Pharaoh.
{5:21} And they will say to them, Jehovah will look upon you and will judge, because ye made our odor hateful in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to give a sword into their hand to kill us.
{5:22} And Moses will turn back to Jehovah, and he will say, My Lord, why didst thou evil to this people? wherefore for this didst, thou send me?
{5:23} And from the time I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he did evil to this people: and delivering, thou didst not deliver thy people.
{6:1} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Now thou shalt see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand will he send them forth, and with a strong hand will he drive them out of his land.
{6:2} And God will speak to Moses, and will say to him, I am Jehovah.
{6:3} And I shall be seen to Abraham, to Isaak, and to Jacob, by God Almighty; and my name Jehovah I was not known to them.
{6:4} And also have I set my covenant with them to give to them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, which they sojourned upon it.
{6:5} And also I heard the groaning of the sons of Israel whom the Egyptians have made to serve: and I will remember my covenant.
{6:6} For this say thou to the sons of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I brought you forth from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I delivered you from their work, and I redeemed you with an arm stretched out and with great judgments.
{6:7} And I took you to me for a people, and I was to you for God: and ye knew that I was Jehovah your God, having brought you forth from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
{6:8} And I brought you to a land which I lifted up my hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaak, and to Jacob, and I gave it to you a possession: I am Jehovah.
{6:9} And Moses spake thus to the sons of Israel: and they heard not to Moses for shortness of spirit, and from hard work.
{6:10} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{6:11} Go, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he shall send forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt.
{6:12} And Moses will speak before Jehovah, saying, Behold, the sons of Israel heard not to me; and how shall Pharaoh hear me, and I of uncircumcised lips?
{6:13} And Jehovah will speak to Moses and to Aaron and will command them to the sons of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring forth the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
{6:14} These the heads of the house of their father: the sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi: these the tribes of Reuben.
{6:15} And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Saul, the son of a Canaanitess; these the tribes of Simeon.
{6:16} And these the names of the sons of Levi, according to their generation; Gershon, and Kohath and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi, seven and thirty and a hundred years.
{6:17} And the sons of Gershon, Libni and Shimi, according to their tribes.
{6:18} And the sons of Kohath; Amram and Izhar and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath, three and thirty and a hundred years.
{6:19} And the sons of Merari: Mahali and Mushi: these the tribes of Levi according to their generations.

{6:25} And Eleazar the son of Aaron, took to him from the daughters of Putiel, for a wife; and she will bare to him Phinehas: these the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their tribes.
{6:26} This Aaron and Moses, whom Jehovah said to them, Bring forth the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt with their army.
{6:27} They having spoken to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt; this Moses and Aaron.
{6:28} And it will be in the day Jehovah spake to Moses in the land of Egypt.
{6:29} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying, I am Jehovah; speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, all which I say to thee.
{6:30} And Moses will say before Jehovah, Behold, I of uncircumcised lips; and how shall Pharaoh hear to me?
{7:1} And Jehovah will say to Moses, See, I gave thee a God to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.
{7:2} Thou shalt speak all that I shall command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak to Pharaoh, and he sent forth the sons of Israel out of his land.
{7:3} And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and I multiplied my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
{7:4} And Pharaoh will not hear to you; and I gave ray hand upon Egypt, and I brought forth my army, my people the sons of Israel, out of Egypt, with great judgments.
{7:5} And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, in my stretching out my hand over Egypt, and my bringing forth the sons of Israel from the midst of them.
{7:6} And Moses will do, and Aaron, as Jehovah commanded them, so did they.
{7:7} And Moses the son of eighty years, and Aaron the son of three and eighty years, in their speaking to Pharaoh.
{7:8} And Jehovah will speak to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
{7:9} When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Give ye a wonder for you; and say to Aaron, Take thy rod and cast down before Pharaoh, it shall be into a dragon.
{7:10} And Moses will go, and Aaron, to Pharaoh, and they will do thus as Jehovah commanded: and Aaron will cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it will be into a dragon.
{7:11} And Pharaoh also will call to the wise men and to the magicians; and the sacred scribes of Egypt, they also will do so with their enchantments.
{7:12} And they will cast down each their rod, and they will be for dragons: and Aaron's rod swallowed their rods.
{7:13} And Pharaoh's heart will be strengthened, and he will not hear to them; as Jehovah said.
{7:14} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Pharaoh's heart was heavy; he refused to send forth the people.
{7:15} Go to Pharaoh in the morning; behold, he will go forth to the water, and standing to meet him at the lip of the river: and the rod which was turned into a serpent thou shalt take in thy hand.
{7:16} And say to him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to thee, saying, Send forth my people, and they shall serve me in the desert: and behold, thou didst not hear until now.
{7:17} Thus said Jehovah, In this thou shalt know that I am Jehovah: Behold me smiting with the rod which is in my hand upon the waters that in the river, and they were turned into blood.
{7:18} And the fish which is in the river shall die, and the river be loathsome: and the Egyptians labored in vain to drink the water from the river.
{7:19} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the waters of Egypt, upon their rivers, upon their canals, and upon their pools, and upon all the collections of their waters, and they shall be blood: and blood was in all the land of Egypt, and in wood, and in stones.
{7:20} And Moses and Aaron will do so as Jehovah commanded; and he will lift up the rod and will smite the water which is in the river, in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants; and all the waters which are in the river shall be turned to blood.
{7:21} And the fish which was in the river died; and the river will be loathsome; and the Egyptians will not be able to drink the water from the river: and the blood will be upon all the land of Egypt.
{7:22} And the sacred scribes of Egypt will do so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart will be strong, and he heard not to them as Jehovah spake.
{7:23} And Pharaoh will turn and will go to his house, and he did not set his heart also to this.
{7:24} And all the Egyptians will dig round about the river for water to drink; for they will not be able to drink from the water of the river.
{7:25} And seven days will be filled up after Jehovah struck the river.
{8:1} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Go to Pharaoh and say to him, So said Jehovah, Send forth my people, and they shall serve me.
{8:2} And if thou refusest to send forth, behold, I smite all thy bounds with.
{8:3} And the river abounded with frogs, and they went up and came into thy house, and into the chamber of thy bed, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading troughs:
{8:4} And upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants shall the frogs go up.
{8:5} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod upon the rivers, and upon the canal; and upon the pools, and bring up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
{8:6} And Aaron will stretch forth his hand upon the waters of Egypt; and the frog will come up and will cover the land of Egypt.
{8:7} And the sacred scribes will do so with their charms; and they will bring up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
{8:8} And Pharaoh will call to Moses and to Aaron, and will say, Pray to Jehovah, and he will remove the frogs from me and from my people: and I will send forth the people and they shall sacrifice to Jehovah.
{8:9} And Moses will say to Pharaoh, Be honored over me: at what time shall I pray for thee and for thy servants and for thy people, to cut off the frogs from thee and from thy houses, only in the river shall they remain?
{8:10} And he will say, To-morrow. And he will say, According to thy word: for thou shalt know, that there is not as Jehovah our God.
{8:11} And the frogs shall turn away from thee and from thy houses and from thy servants and from thy people; only in the river shall they remain.
{8:12} And Moses will go forth and Aaron from Pharaoh; and Moses will cry to Jehovah, for the word of the frogs which he set against Pharaoh.
{8:13} And Jehovah will do according to the word of Moses, and the frogs will die out of the houses, out of the villages and out of the fields.
{8:14} And they will gather them together, heaps, heaps: and the land will be loathsome.
{8:15} And Pharaoh will see that there was enlargement, and he made his heart heavy, and he heard not to them; as Jehovah spake.
{8:16} And the sacred scribes will do so with their enchantments to bring forth gnats, and they will not be able: and there will be gnats upon man and upon quadrupeds.
{8:17} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy rod and smite the dust of the earth, and it shall be for gnats upon all the land of Egypt.
{8:18} And they will do so; and Aaron will stretch forth his hand with his rod, and will smite the dust of the earth, and it will be gnats upon man and in quadrupeds: all the dust of the earth was gnats upon all the land of Egypt.
{8:19} And the sacred scribes will say to Pharaoh, This the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart will be strengthened, and he heard not to them: as Jehovah said.
{8:20} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and thou shalt stand before Pharaoh (behold he will go forth to the water); and say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Send forth my people, and they shall serve me.
{8:21} And I separated in that day the land of Goshen, which my people stood upon it, for no gad-fly to be there; that thou shalt know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth.
{8:22} For if thou sendest not my people forth, behold me sending upon thee and upon thy servants, and upon thy people and upon thy houses, the gad-fly: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with the gad-fly, and also the land which they are upon it.
{8:23} And I put a redemption between my people and between thy people; and in the morrow shall be this sign.
{8:24} And Jehovah will do so; and the gad-fly will come forth a multitude into the house of Pharaoh and the house of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt: and the land will be destroyed from before the gad-fly.
{8:25} And Pharaoh will call to Moses, and to Aaron, and will say, Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.
{8:26} And Moses will say, It not being right to do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God: Behold, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians in their eyes, and will they not stone us?
{8:27} A way of three days will we go into the desert and sacrifice to Jehovah our God as he shall say to us.
{8:28} And Pharaoh will say, I will send you forth and sacrifice ye to Jehovah your God in the desert; only departing, ye shall not go far away: pray for me.
{8:29} And Moses will say, Behold, I will go forth from thee, and pray for thee to Jehovah; and the gad-fly shall depart from Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people, to-morrow: only Pharaoh shall not add to deceive, not to send away the people to sacrifice to Jehovah.
{8:30} And Moses will go forth from Pharaoh, and will pray to Jehovah.
{8:31} And Jehovah will do according to the word of Moses; and he will remove the gad-fly from Pharaoh, and from his servants, and from his people; not one was left over.
{8:32} And Pharaoh will make his heart heavy also in this time; he sent not forth the people.
{9:1} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and speak to him, Thus said Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Send forth my people and they shall serve me.
{9:2} For if thou refusest to send forth, but yet thou holdest fast upon them,
{9:3} Behold, the hand of Jehovah is upon thy cattle which are in the field; upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen and upon the sheep: death exceedingly heavy.
{9:4} And Jehovah separated between the cattle of Israel and between the cattle of Egypt: and nothing shall die from all the sons of Israel, spoken of.
{9:5} And Jehovah will set an appointment, saying, To-morrow Jehovah will do this word in the land.
{9:6} And Jehovah will do this word in the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt will die: and from the cattle of the sons of Israel, not one died.
{9:7} And Pharaoh will send, and behold, from the cattle of Israel, there died not even one And the heart of Pharaoh will be heavy, and he sent not forth the people.
{9:8} And Jehovah will say to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you your two fists full of ashes of the furnace; and Moses sprinkled it towards the heavens in the eyes of Pharaoh.
{9:9} And it was for dust upon all the land of Egypt, and it was upon man, and upon quadruped for a burning sore breaking forth with pustules over all the land of Egypt.
{9:10} And they will take ashes of the furnace and will stand before Pharaoh; and Moses will sprinkle it towards the heavens; and it will be a burning sore, breaking forth with pustules upon man and upon quadruped.
{9:11} And the sacred scribes will not be able to stand before Moses on account of the burning sore: for the burning sore was upon the sacred scribes, and in all Egypt.
{9:12} And Jehovah will bind fast the heart of Pharaoh, and he heard not to them: as Jehovah spake to Moses.
{9:13} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus said Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Send forth my people, and they shall serve me.
{9:14} For in this time I send all my plagues into thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people: so that thou shalt know that there is not as I in all the earth.
{9:15} For now I sent forth my hand, and surely I will smite thee and thy people with death; and thou shalt be destroyed from the earth.
{9:16} And yet for this I raised thee up in order to cause thee to see my strength; and for the sake of declaring my name in all the earth.
{9:17} As yet lifting up thyself against my people not to send them forth?
{9:18} Behold, I rain at this time to-morrow, hail exceedingly heavy, which was not as this in Egypt from the day it was founded even now.
{9:19} And now send forth to secure thy cattle, and all which is to thee in the field: every man and quadruped which shall be found in the field, and shall not be gathered together to the house, and the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
{9:20} He fearing the word of Jehovah from the servants of Pharaoh, caused his servants to flee, and his cattle to the houses.
{9:21} And he who set not his heart to the word of Jehovah, will leave his servants and his cattle in the field.
{9:22} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward the heavens, and there shall be hail upon all the land of Egypt, upon man and upon quadruped, and upon the green herb of the field in the land of Egypt.
{9:23} And Moses will stretch forth his rod towards the heavens, and Jehovah gave voices, and hail; and fire will go upon the earth: and Jehovah will rain hail upon the land of Egypt.
{9:24} And there will be hail and fire taking hold in the midst of the hail, exceedingly heavy, which was not as this upon all the land of Egypt from the time it was for a nation.
{9:25} And the hail will strike in all the land of Egypt, all which is in the field, from man, and even to quadruped, and every green herb of the field; the hail smote and broke in pieces every tree of the field.
{9:26} Only in the land of Goshen, there were the sons of Israel, was no hail.
{9:27} And Pharaoh will send and call for Moses and for Aaron, and will say to them, I sinned this time: Jehovah is just, and I and my people unjust.
{9:28} Pray ye to Jehovah and much, from there being voices of God and hail; and I will send you forth, and ye shall not add to stand.
{9:29} And Moses will say to him, When I have gone forth from the city, I will spread forth my hands to Jehovah; the voices shall cease, and the hail shall be no more; for thou shalt know that to Jehovah is the earth.
{9:30} And thou and thy servants, I knew that ye will not yet fear from before Jehovah God.
{9:31} And the flax and the barley were struck: for the barley was ripe, and the flax high.
{9:32} And the wheat and spelt were not struck, for they were late.
{9:33} And Moses will go forth from Pharaoh out of the city, and he will spread forth his hands to Jehovah, and the voices will cease; and the hail and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
{9:34} And Pharaoh will see that the rain ceased, and the hail and the voices; and he will add to sin, and he will make his heart heavy, he and his servants.
{9:35} And Pharaoh's heart will be bound fast, and he sent not forth the sons of Israel; as Jehovah spake by the hand of Moses.
{10:1} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Go to Pharaoh: for I made his heart heavy, and the heart of his servants; for sake of my setting these my signs within him.
{10:2} And that thou shalt recount in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what I performed in Egypt, and my signs which I set up among them; and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
{10:3} And Moses will come, and Aaron, to Pharaoh, and they will say to him, Thus said Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, Until long didst thou refuse to humble thyself from before me. Send forth my people and they shall serve me.
{10:4} For if thou refusest to send forth my people, behold me bringing to-morrow the locust into thy bounds.
{10:5} And it covered the eye of the earth, and he shall not be able to see the earth: and it shall eat the remainder of that escaping, being left to you from the hail; and it shall eat every tree springing up to you out of the field.
{10:6} And they filled thy houses and all the houses of thy servants, and the houses of all Egypt; which thy fathers saw not, and thy fathers' fathers, from the day they were upon the earth, even till this day. And he will turn away and go forth from Pharaoh.
{10:7} And Pharaoh's servants will say to him, How long will this, be to us for a snare? Send forth the men, and they shall serve Jehovah their God, before thou shalt know that Egypt is destroyed.
{10:8} And he will turn back Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh, and he will say to them, Go, serve Jehovah your God: who and who are they going.
{10:9} And Moses will say, With our youths and with our old men will we go; with our sons and with our daughters, with our sheep and with our oxen will we go: for a festival of Jehovah is to us.
{10:10} And he will say to them, So will Jehovah be with you, as I will send you forth, and your little ones: see ye, for evil is manifest before you.
{10:11} Not so: go now, ye men, and serve Jehovah; for this ye yourselves were seeking. And he will drive them out from before Pharaoh.
{10:12} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand upon the land of Egypt, with the locust, and it will come up upon the land of Egypt; and it shall eat every green herb of the land, all which the hail left.
{10:13} And Moses will stretch forth his rod upon the land of Egypt, and Jehovah drove an east wind upon the earth, all that day and all the night: it was morning, and the east wind raised up the locust.
{10:14} And the locust will come up upon all the land of Egypt, and it will rest in all the bounds of Egypt exceeding many: before it was there no locust thus like it, and after it, it shall not be thus.
{10:15} And it will cover the eye of all the earth, and the land will be dark; and it will eat every green herb of the land, and all the fruit of the tree which the hail left: and not a green thing was left in the tree, and in the green herb of the field, in all the land of Egypt.
{10:16} And Pharaoh will hasten to call for Moses and for Aaron; and he will say, I sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.
{10:17} And at this time take away now my sin, only this time, and pray ye to Jehovah your God, and he will remove from me only this death.
{10:18} And he will go forth from Pharaoh, and will pray to Jehovah.
{10:19} And Jehovah will turn a wind of the sea, exceedingly strong, and he will take away the locust and will drive it into the sea of sedge: not one locust remained in all the bounds of Egypt.
{10:20} And Jehovah will bind fast the heart of Pharaoh, and he sent not forth the sons of Israel.
{10:21} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand towards the heavens, and darkness shall be upon the land of Egypt, and the darkness shall be felt.
{10:22} And Moses will stretch forth his hand toward the heavens, and there shall be thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.
{10:23} They saw not a man his brother, and they rose not up each from his lower part, three days: and to all the sons of Israel there was light in their dwellings.
{10:24} And Pharaoh will call to Moses, and will say, Go ye, serve Jehovah: only your sheep and your oxen shall be left; also your little ones shall go with you.
{10:25} And Moses will say, Thou also shalt give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, and we sacrificed to Jehovah our God.
{10:26} And also our cattle shall go with us; a hoof shall not be left; for from us we shall take to serve Jehovah our God; and we shall not know what we shall serve Jehovah till we come there.
{10:27} And Jehovah will bind fast the heart of Pharaoh, and he not being willing to send them forth.
{10:28} And Pharaoh will say to him, Go from me, watch to thyself; thou shalt not add to see my face, for in the day of thy seeing my face thou shalt die.
{10:29} And Moses will say, Thou spakest well: I will no more add to see thy face.
{11:1} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Yet one blow will I bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt; after this he will send you forth from here; when his sending forth to go, driving, he will drive you out from here.
{11:2} Speak now in the ears of the people; they shall ask each from his friend, and a woman from her friend, vessels of silver and vessels of gold.
{11:3} And Jehovah will give favor to the people in the eyes of the Egyptians: also the man Moses was exceedingly great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh's servants, and in the eyes of the people.
{11:4} And Moses will say, Thus said Jehovah, About the middle of the night I will go forth into the midst of Egypt.
{11:5} And every first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh sitting upon his throne, even to the first-born of the maid which is behind the two mill-stones; and every first-born of quadruped.
{11:6} And a great cry was in all the land of Egypt, such as was not, and such shall not be added.
{11:7} And against all the sons of Israel, a dog shall not sharpen his tongue, from man and even to cattle: so that ye shall know that Jehovah will separate between Egypt and between Israel.
{11:8} And all these thy servants shall come down to me, and worship to me, saying, Go forth, thou, and all the people which are at thy feet: and after this I will go forth. And he will go forth from Pharaoh in the heat of anger.
{11:9} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Pharaoh will not hear to you; so that my wonders be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
{11:10} And Moses and Aaron did all these signs before Pharaoh; and Jehovah will bind fast Pharaoh's heart, and he sent not forth the sons of Israel from his land.
{12:1} And Jehovah will say to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
{12:2} This month is to you the beginning of months: this to you the first month of the year.
{12:3} Speak ye to all the assembly of Israel, saying, In the tenth of this month and they shall take to them each a sheep, according to the house of the fathers; a sheep for a house.
{12:4} And if the house shall be little from being for a sheep, and he taking, and his neighbor drawing nigh his house according to the number of souls; each according to the mouth of his eating shall ye reckon for the sheep.
{12:5} A perfect sheep, a male, the son of a year, shall be to you from the he-lambs and from the goats ye shall take.
{12:6} And it shall be to you for a preservation till the fourteenth day of this month; and they shall slaughter it, all the convocation of the assembly of Israel, between the two evenings.
{12:7} And they took from the blood and gave upon the two door-posts, and upon the lintel within the houses which they shall eat it in them.
{12:8} And they shall eat the flesh in that night roasted with fire and unleavened; upon bitter herbs shall they eat it.
{12:9} Ye shall not eat from it raw and boiled from boiling with water, but roasted with fire, its head with its legs with its inner part.
{12:10} Ye shall not leave from it till morning: and that remaining from it till morning, ye shall burn with fire.
{12:11} And so shall ye eat it, your loins girded, your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand: and ye ate it in hasty flight; a passing over to Jehovah.
{12:12} And I passed over in the land of Egypt in this night, and I struck every first-born in the land of Egypt from man even to quadruped: and against all the gods of Egypt I will do judgments: I Jehovah.
{12:13} And the blood was to you for a sign upon the houses where you are there: and I saw the blood and I passed over you, and the blow shall not be upon you to destroy, in my striking upon the land of Egypt.
{12:14} And this day shall be to you for a remembrance; and ye kept it a festival to Jehovah for your generations: ye shall keep a festival a law forever.
{12:15} Seven days ye shall eat unleavened; wholly in the first day shall ye turn away leaven in your houses; for all eating leavened and that soul was destroyed from Israel from the first day even to the seventh day.
{12:16} And in the first day a calling of holiness, and in the seventh day a calling of holiness shall be to you; every service shall not be done in them only what shall be eaten by every soul; this only shall be done by you.
{12:17} And ye watched the unleavened; for in this self-same day I brought forth your armies out of the land of Egypt and watch ye this day for your generations a law forever.
{12:18} In the first, in the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, ye shall eat unleavened till the one and twentieth day of the month in the evening.
{12:19} Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses; for all eating from the leavened, that soul shall be destroyed from the assembly of Israel, for the sojourner or for the native of the land.
{12:20} All leavened ye shall not eat: in all your dwellings ye shall eat unleavened.
{12:21} And Moses will call for all the old men of Israel and he will say to them, Draw out and take to yourselves a sheep according to your tribes, and slaughter the passing over.
{12:22} And take ye a bundle of hyssop, and dip in the blood that is upon the threshhold, and touch upon the lintel, and upon the two door-posts from the blood which is upon the threshhold and ye shall not come forth each from the door of his house till morning.
{12:23} And Jehovah passed over to strike the Egyptians; and he saw the blood upon the lintel, and upon the two doorposts, and Jehovah passed by the door and will not give him destroying to come in to your houses to strike.
{12:24} And watch ye this word for a law to thee and to thy sons forever.
{12:25} And it shall be when ye shall come to the land which Jehovah will give to you, as he spake, watch ye this service.
{12:26} And it shall be when your sons shall say to you, What this service to you?
{12:27} And they said, This the sacrifice of the passing over to Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt in his striking the Egyptians, and he delivered our houses. And the people will bow down and will worship.
{12:28} And the sons of Israel will go, and will do as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron; thus did they.
{12:29} And it will be in the middle of the night, and Jehovah struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh sitting upon his throne, to the first-born of the captive which is in the house of the pit; and every first-born of the cattle.
{12:30} And Pharaoh will rise up in the night, he and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there will be a great cry in Egypt: for not a house where there was not the dead there.
{12:31} And he will call for Moses and for Aaron by night, and he will say, Arise, go forth from the midst of my people, also ye, also the sons of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah as ye spake.
{12:32} Also your sheep, also your oxen take as ye spake, and go and bless also me.
{12:33} And Egypt will be strong upon the people to hasten to send them forth out of the land; for they said, We are all dying.
{12:34} And the people will take up their dough before it will be leavened, their kneading-bowls bound in their garments upon their shoulders.
{12:35} And the sons of Israel did as Moses spake: and they will ask of the Egyptians, silver vessels and gold vessels, and garments.
{12:36} And Jehovah gave favor to the people in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they will lend them; and they will strip the Egyptians.
{12:37} And the sons of Israel will remove from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand footmen; men apart from the little ones.
{12:38} And also a great mixture went up with them; and sheep and oxen, very much cattle.
{12:39} And they will cook the dough which they brought out of Egypt unleavened cakes, for it was not leavened; for they were driven out of Egypt, for they could not linger, and also they made not for themselves food.
{12:40} And the dwelling of the sons of Israel which they dwelt in Egypt, was thirty years and four hundred years.
{12:41} And it will be from the end of thirty years and four hundred years, in this self-same day all the armies of Jehovah will go forth out of the land of Egypt.
{12:42} This a night of watchings to Jehovah, for bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt: it is this night to Jehovah of watching to all the sons of Israel for their generations.
{12:43} And Jehovah will say to Moses and Aaron, This the law of the passing over: every son of a stranger shall not eat of it.
{12:44} And every servant of a man bought with silver, and thou hast circumcised him, then he shall eat of it.
{12:45} The sojourner and the hireling shall not eat of it.
{12:46} In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not bring forth out of the house from the flesh without, and ye shall not break a bone of it.
{12:47} All the assembly of Israel shall do it.
{12:48} And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and do the passing over to Jehovah, all the males to him being circumcised, and then he shall draw near to do it; and he was as a native of the land: and every one uncircumcised shall not eat of it.
{12:49} One law shall be to the native and to the stranger sojourning in the midst of you.
{12:50} And all the sons of Israel will do as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
{12:51} And it will be in this self-same day, Jehovah brought forth the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt with their armies.
{13:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{13:2} Consecrate to me every first-born bursting open every womb among the sons of Israel, of man and of cattle: it is to me.
{13:3} And Moses will say to the people, Remember this day which ye came forth out of Egypt, out of the house of servants; for by strength of hand Jehovah brought you forth from here: and leavened shall not be eaten.
{13:4} The day ye came forth in the month of Abib.
{13:5} And it was when Jehovah shall bring thee forth to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware to thy fathers to give to thee, a land flowing with milk and honey; and do thou this service in this month.
{13:6} Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened, and in the seventh day a festival to Jehovah.
{13:7} Unleavened shall be eaten seven days: and leavened shall not be seen to thee in all thy bounds.
{13:8} And announce to thy son in this day, saying, For this Jehovah did to me in my coming out of Egypt.
{13:9} And it was to thee for a sign upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes; so that the law of Jehovah shall be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand Jehovah brought thee forth out of Egypt.
{13:10} And watch this law according to its appointment from days to days.
{13:11} And it was when Jehovah shall bring thee to the land of the Canaanites, as he sware to thee and to thy fathers, and he gave it to thee.
{13:12} And thou madest pass over all bursting open the womb, to Jehovah; and every one bursting forth young of the quadruped which shall be to thee; the males are to Jehovah.
{13:13} And every first-born of the ass, thou shalt redeem with a sheep; and if thou shalt not redeem, thou shalt break his neck: and every first-born of man among thy sons thou shalt redeem.
{13:14} And it was when thy son shall ask thee to-morrow, saying, What this? and thou saidst to him, With strength of hand Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt from the house of servants.
{13:15} And it shall be when Pharaoh was hard to send us forth, and Jehovah will kill every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of man to the firstborn of cattle; for this I sacrifice to Jehovah all bursting forth the womb, the males; and all the first-born of my sons I will redeem.
{13:16} And it was for a sign upon thy hand, and for bands between thine eyes: for with a strong hand Jehovah brought us forth from Egypt.
{13:17} And it shall be in Pharaoh's sending forth the people, and God directed not the way of the land of the Philistines, for it is near; for God said, Lest the people shall grieve in their seeing war, and they turn back to Egypt.
{13:18} And God will turn the people about the way of the desert, the sea of sedge: and the sons of Israel went up active out of the land of Egypt.
{13:19} And Moses will take the bones of Joseph with him: for swearing he caused the sons of Israel to swear, saying, For reviewing, God will review you; and carry up my bones with you from here.
{13:20} And they will remove from Succoth, and they will encamp in Etham, in the extremity of the desert.
{13:21} And Jehovah went before them the day in a pillar of cloud, to direct them the way; and the night in a pillar of fire to give light to them; to go the day and the night.
{13:22} And the pillar of cloud will not give way, the day, and the pillar of fire, the night, before the people.
{14:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{14:2} Speak to the sons of Israel, and they shall turn back and shall encamp before the mouth of Hahiroth, between Migdol and between the sea, before Baal-Zephon: before them shall ye encamp by the sea.
{14:3} And Pharaoh will say concerning the sons of Israel, They are wandering in perplexity in the land; the desert closed upon them.
{14:4} And I bound fast Pharaoh's heart, and he pursued after them; and I will be honored in Pharaoh and all his army; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they will do so.
{14:5} And it was announced to the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh will be turned, and his servants, against the people, and they will say, What this we did, that we sent forth Israel from serving us?
{14:6} And he will harness his chariot, and he took his people with him.
{14:7} And he will take six hundred chosen chariots, and all the horsemen of Egypt, and rulers over them all.
{14:8} And Jehovah will bind fast the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he will pursue after the sons of Israel: and the sons of Israel went forth with a high hand.
{14:9} And the Egyptians will pursue after them, and they will enclose them, having encamped by the sea; all the horse, the chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen and his army, by the mouth of Hahiroth, before Baal-Zephon.
{14:10} And Pharaoh drew near, and the sons of Israel will lift up their eyes, and behold, Egypt encamped behind them; and they will be exceedingly afraid: and the sons of Israel will cry to Jehovah.
{14:11} And they will say to Moses, Because no tombs are in Egypt, didst thou take us to die in the desert? what this thou didst to us to bring us forth out of Egypt?
{14:12} Is not this the word which we spake to thee in Egypt, saying, Desist from us, and we will serve the Egyptians? For it is good to us to serve Egypt rather than that we died in the desert.
{14:13} And Moses will say to the people, Ye shall not fear; stand ye and see the deliverance of Jehovah, which he will do to you this day: for the Egyptians whom ye saw this day, ye shall not add to see them more forever.
{14:14} Jehovah will wage war for you and ye shall be silent.
{14:15} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Why wilt thou cry to me? speak to the sons of Israel and they shall remove.
{14:16} And thou, lift up thy rod, and stretch forth thy hand over the sea, and break it up: and the sons of Israel shall go in the midst of the sea on dry land.
{14:17} And I, behold me binding fast the heart of the Egyptians, and they shall go after them: and I will be honored in Pharaoh, and upon all his army, and in his chariots, and in his horsemen.
{14:18} And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah in the getting me honor in Pharaoh, in his chariots and in his horsemen.
{14:19} And the messenger of God going before the camp of Israel will remove, and will go from behind them; and the pillar of the cloud will remove from before them, and will stand from behind them,
{14:20} And it will come between the camp of Egypt and between the camp of Israel; and it will be the cloud, and the darkness, and it will make the night light: and this drew not near to this all the night.
{14:21} And Moses will stretch forth his hand over the sea, and Jehovah will cause the sea to go by a strong east wind all the night; and he will set the sea for dry land, and the waters will be rent.
{14:22} And the sons of Israel will go in the midst of the sea on dry land; and the waters to them a wall from their right hand and from their left.
{14:23} And the Egyptians will pursue and will go after them, all the horse of Pharaoh and his chariots and his horsemen to the midst of the sea.
{14:24} And it will be in the watch of the morning, Jehovah will look forth to the camp of Egypt in the pillar of fire and the cloud, and he will disturb the camp of Egypt.
{14:25} And he will remove the wheel of their chariots, and they will drive in heaviness; and Egypt will say, I will flee from the face of Israel; for Jehovah waged war for them against Egypt.
{14:26} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand over the sea, and the waters shall turn back upon Egypt, upon its chariots and upon its horsemen.
{14:27} And Moses will stretch forth his hand over the sea, and the sea will turn back before the morning to its perpetuity. And the Egyptians fled at meeting it, and Jehovah will shake off Egypt in the midst of the sea.
{14:28} And the waters will turn back, and will cover the chariots and the horsemen, to all Pharaoh's army coming after them into the sea: and there was not left among them even one.
{14:29} And the sons of Israel came upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were to them a wall from the right hand and from the left.
{14:30} And Jehovah will save Israel in that day, from the hand of Egypt: and Israel will see the Egyptians dead upon the lip of the sea.
{14:31} And Israel will see the great hand which Jehovah did upon Egypt; and the people will fear Jehovah, and they will believe in Jehovah, and in Moses his servant.
{15:1} Then will Moses sing, and the sons of Israel, this song to Jehovah; and they will speak, saying, I will sing to Jehovah, for exalting himself, he was exalted: the horse and his horsemen he threw into the sea.
{15:2} Jehovah my strength and song, and he shall be to me for salvation: this my God, and I will cause him to rest; the God of my father, and I will exalt him.
{15:3} Jehovah, a man of war: Jehovah his name.
{15:4} The chariots of Pharaoh and his army he threw into the sea; his chosen rulers sank in the sea of sedge.
{15:5} The depths will cover them: they will go down into the deep as a stone.
{15:6} Thy right hand, Jehovah, was magnified in strength: thy right hand, Jehovah, will break in pieces the enemy.
{15:7} And in the multitude of thy majesty thou wilt destroy those rising up against thee: thou wilt send forth thine anger; it shall eat them as straw.
{15:8} And by the spirit of thine anger the waters shook them off, the flowings stood up as a heap: the depths were contracted in the heart of the sea.
{15:9} The enemy said, I will pursue, I will enclose, I will divide the spoil: my soul shall be filled with them: I will draw out my sword, my hand shall dispossess them.
{15:10} Thou didst blow with thy spirit; the sea covered them: they rolled down as lead in the great waters.
{15:11} Who like thee among the gods, O Jehovah? who like thee magnified in in holiness, wonderful in praise, doing a wonder?
{15:12} Thou didst stretch forth thy right hand, the earth will swallow them.
{15:13} Thou didst lead in thy kindness this people thou didst redeem: thou didst conduct with thy strength to thy holy dwelling.
{15:14} The peoples heard, and they will be angry: pain took those inhabiting Philistia.
{15:15} Then the chiefs of Edom trembled; the mighty of Moab, trembling, shall take them; all those dwelling in Canaan melted away.
{15:16} Dread shall fall upon them and terror: by the greatness of thine arm they shall be dumb as a stone; till thy people pass over, O Jehovah: till this people pass over, thou didst buy.
{15:17} Thou shalt bring them in and shalt plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, into the place of thy Sabbath, thou didst make, O Jehovah: a holy place, O Jehovah, which thy hands prepared.
{15:18} Jehovah shall reign forever and yet.
{15:19} For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen, into the sea, and Jehovah will turn back over them the water of the sea: and the sons of Israel went on the dry land in the midst of the sea.
{15:20} And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, will take the drum in her hand; and all the women will go forth after her, with drums and with lutes.
{15:21} And Miriam will sing to them, Sing ye to Jehovah; for being lifted up, he was lifted up: the horse and his horseman he threw into the sea.
{15:22} And Moses will remove Israel from the sea of sedge, and they will come forth to the desert of Shur; and they will go three days into the desert, and they found not water.
{15:23} And they will come to Marah, and they will not be able to drink the waters of Marah, for they are bitter: for this he called the name bitterness.
{15:24} And the people will murmur against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
{15:25} And he will cry to Jehovah, and Jehovah will show him a tree, and he will cast into the waters, and the waters will become sweet: then he set to him a law and judgment, and there he tried him.
{15:26} And he will say, If hearkening thou wilt hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and thou wilt do the right in his eyes, and give ear to his commands, and watch all his laws, every disease which I put upon Egypt I will not put upon thee: for I am Jehovah healing thee.
{15:27} And they will come to Ailam; and twelve fountains of water there, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
{16:1} And they will remove from Ailam, and all the assembly of the sons of Israel will come to the desert of Sin, which is between Ailam and between Sinai, the fifteenth day of the second month of their coming out of the land of Egypt.
{16:2} And all the assembly of the sons of Israel will murmur against Moses and against Aaron in the desert.
{16:3} And the sons of Israel will say to them, Who will give to die by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt in our sitting by the pot of flesh, in our eating bread to satiety? for ye brought us forth to this desert to kill all this convocation with hunger.
{16:4} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Behold me raining for you bread from the heavens; and the people shall go forth and shall gather the word of a day in its day, so that I shall try them, whether they will go in my law or not.
{16:5} And it was in the sixth day, and they prepared what they shall bring in; and it was double to what they will gather day by day.
{16:6} And Moses will say, and Aaron, to all the sons of Israel, The evening, and ye knew that Jehovah brought you out of the land of Egypt:
{16:7} And the morning, and ye saw the glory of Jehovah, in his hearing your murmurings against Jehovah and what are we that ye will murmur against us?
{16:8} And Moses will say, In Jehovah giving you in the evening flesh to eat, and bread in the morning to satiety; in Jehovah hearing your murmurings which ye murmured against him: and what are we? not against us your murmurings but against Jehovah.
{16:9} And Moses will say to Aaron, Say to all the assembly of the sons of Israel, Come near before Jehovah: for he heard your murmurings.
{16:10} And it shall be as Aaron spake to all the assembly of the sons of Israel, and they will turn to the desert, and behold, the glory of Jehovah was seen in the cloud.
{16:11} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{16:12} I heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel; speak to them, saying, Between the two evenings ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye knew that I am Jehovah your God.
{16:13} And it shall be in the evening, the quail shall come up and shall cover the camp: and in the morning the dew was lying round about the camp.
{16:14} And the dew lying will go up, and behold, upon the face of the desert a small thing being peeled off thin, as pitch upon the earth.
{16:15} And the sons of Israel will see, and they will say, each to his brother, What this? for they knew not what it was And Moses will say to them, This the bread which Jehovah gave to you to eat.
{16:16} This the word which Jehovah commanded, Gather ye from it, each according to the mouth of his eating: an omer for the head from the numbering of your souls, ye shall take each for those in his tent.
{16:17} And the sons of Israel will do so, and they will gather this much, and this little.
{16:18} And they will measure by the handful, and the abundance did not exceed, and the little was not diminished: they gathered a man according to the mouth of his eating.
{16:19} And Moses will say to them, No man shall leave from it till morning.
{16:20} And they heard not to Moses; and the men will leave from it till morning, and it will rot with worms, and it will stink: and Moses will be angry with them.
{16:21} And they will gather it in the morning by morning, a man according to the mouth of his eating: and the sun was hot and it melted.
{16:22} And it will be in the sixth day, they gathered double the bread, two handfuls for one; and all the chiefs of the assembly will come and announce to Moses.
{16:23} And he will say to them, This what Jehovah spake, To-morrow the Sabbath, a holy rest to Jehovah: what ye will cook, cook; and what ye will boil, boil; and all exceeding, leave for you for preservation till the morning.
{16:24} And they left it till morning as Moses commanded: and it did not stink, and no worm was in it.
{16:25} And Moses will say, Eat this day; for the Sabbath this day to Jehovah: this day ye shall not find in the field.
{16:26} Six days ye shall gather, and in the seventh day, the Sabbath, it shall not be in it.
{16:27} And it will be in the seventh day, and they will go forth from the people to gather, and they found not.
{16:28} And Jehovah will say to Moses, How long refused ye to watch my commands and my law?
{16:29} See, for Jehovah gave to you the Sabbath; for this be gave to you in the sixth day, bread of two days: sit ye each in his station; a man shall not go forth from his place in the seventh day.
{16:30} And the people shall rest in the seventh day.
{16:31} And the house of Israel will call its name portion: as the seed of coriander, white, and its taste as a flat cake with honey.
{16:32} And Moses will say, This the word which Jehovah commanded, Fill the omer from it for a preservation to your generations; so that they shall see the bread which I gave you to eat in the desert in my bringing you forth out of the land of Egypt.
{16:33} And Moses will say to Aaron, Take one vase and give there an omer full of manna, and deposit it before Jehovah for a preservation to your generations.
{16:34} As Jehovah commanded Moses, and Aaron will deposit it before the testimony for preservation.
{16:35} And the sons of Israel ate the manna forty years till they came to a land inhabited: they ate the portion till they came to the extremity of the land of Canaan.
{16:36} And the omer the tenth of this ephah.
{17:1} And all the assembly of the sons of Israel will remove from the desert of Sin, according to their removings by the mouth of Jehovah; and they will encamp in Rephidim; and no water for the people to drink.
{17:2} And the people contended with Moses, and they will say, Give to us water and we will drink. And Moses will say to them, Why will ye contend with me, and why will ye tempt Jehovah?
{17:3} And the people will thirst there for water; and the people will murmur against Moses, and will say, For what this did ye bring us up out of Egypt to kill us and our sons and our cattle with thirst?
{17:4} And Moses will cry to Jehovah, saying, What shall I do to this people? yet a little and they will stone me.
{17:5} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Pass over before the people and take with thee from the old men of Israel; and thy rod which thou didst strike with it the river, take in thy hand and go.
{17:6} And behold, I stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and strike upon the rock, and waters shall come forth from it, and the people drank. And Moses will do so before the eyes of the old men of Israel.
{17:7} And he will call the name of the place, Temptation, and Strife, for the contention of the sons of Israel, and because they tempted Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah in the midst of us or not?
{17:8} And Amalek will come and will wage war with Israel, in Rephidim.
{17:9} And Moses will say to Joshua, Choose to us men, and go forth, wage war with Amalek: to-morrow I stand upon the head of the hill and the rod of God in my band.
{17:10} And Joshua will do as Moses said to him to wage war with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron and Hur, went up to the head of the hill.
{17:11} And it was as Moses will lift up his hand, Israel prevailed: and as he will put down his hand and Amalek prevailed.
{17:12} And the hands of Moses were heavy; and they will take a stone and put under him, and he will sit upon it: and Aaron and Hur took hold upon his hands, one from here, and one from there; and his hands will be in firmness till the sun went forth.
{17:13} And Joshua will overthrow Amalek and his people with the mouth of the sword.
{17:14} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Write this a remembrance in the book, and set in the ears of Joshua: for wiping off I will wipe off the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens.
{17:15} And Moses will build an altar, and he will call its name, Jehovah my Standard.
{17:16} For he will say, Because the hand upon the throne of Jehovah, war to Jehovah with Amalek from generation to generation.
{18:1} And Jethro, priest of Midian, the father-in-law of Moses, will hear all which God did to Moses and to Israel his people, for Jehovah brought forth Israel out of Egypt:
{18:2} And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, will take Zipporah, Moses' wife, after her sending forth,
{18:3} And her two sons, which the name of the one Gershom, for he said I was a stranger in a strange land;
{18:4} And the name of the one Eliezer; for the God of my father for my help, and he will take me away from the sword of Pharaoh.
{18:5} And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, will come, and and his sons and his wife, to Moses to the desert, where he encamped there in the mountain of God.
{18:6} And he will say to Moses, I thy father-in-law, Jethro, came to thee, and thy wife and her two sons with her.
{18:7} And Moses will go forth to the meeting of his father-in-law, and will worship him and kiss him: and they will ask each his friend of peace; and they will come into the tent.
{18:8} And Moses will recount to his father-in-law all which Jehovah did to Pharaoh, and to Egypt on account of Israel, all the distress which found them in the way; and Jehovah will deliver them.
{18:9} And Jethro will rejoice for all the good which Jehovah did to Israel, whom he took away out of the hand of Egypt.
{18:10} And Jethro will say, Praised be Jehovah who took you away out of the hand of Egypt, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who took away the people from under the hand of Egypt.
{18:11} Now I knew that Jehovah is great above all gods; for in the word they acted proudly over them.
{18:12} And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, will take a burnt-offering and sacrifices to God: and Aaron will come, and all the old men of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.
{18:13} And it will be on the morrow, and Moses will sit to judge the people: and they will stand by Moses from the morning to the evening.
{18:14} And Moses' father-in-law will see all which he did for the people, and he will say, What this thou doest to the people? Wherefore wilt thou sit alone by thyself, and all the people stand by thee from morning to evening?
{18:15} And Moses will say to his father-in-law, Because the people will come to me to seek God.
{18:16} For when the word will be to them, they came to me, and I judged between a man and between his friend, and I made known the laws of God and his precepts.
{18:17} And Moses' father-in-law will say to him, The word is not good which thou doest.
{18:18} Fading, thou wilt fade away, also thou, also this people that is with thee: for this word is heavy for thee; thou wilt not be able to do it thyself alone.
{18:19} Now hear to my voice, I will advise thee, and God will be with thee: be thou for the people towards God, and bring thou their words to God;
{18:20} And teach them the laws and the precepts and make known to them the way they shall go in it, and the work which they shall do.
{18:21} And thou shalt look out from all the people men of ability, fearing God, men of truth, men hating gain; and set thou over them chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of ten.
{18:22} And they judged the people in all time: and it will be every great word they will bring to thee, and every small word they shall judge: and it will be light for thee, and they shall lift up with thee.
{18:23} If thou shalt do this word, and God commanded thee, and thou shalt be able to stand, and all this people shall go to their place in peace.
{18:24} And Moses will hear to the voice of Jethro, and will do all that he said.
{18:25} And Moses will choose men of ability from all Israel, and he will give them heads over the people, chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, chiefs of ten.
{18:26} And they judged the people in all time; and the hard word they brought to Moses, and every small word they will judge themselves.
{18:27} And Moses will, send away his father-in-law, and he will go for himself to his land.
{19:1} In the third month, in the coming forth of the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt, in that day they came to the desert of Sinai.
{19:2} And they will remove from Rephidim, and they will come to the desert of Sinai, and they will encamp in the desert; and Israel will encamp there before the mountain.
{19:3} And Moses went up to God, and Jehovah will call to him from the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and shalt announce to the sons of Israel:
{19:4} Ye saw what I did to Egypt, and I will lift you up upon the wings of eagles, and I will bring you to me.
{19:5} And now if hearing, ye shall hear to my voice, and watch my covenant, and ye were to me wealth above all peoples, for to me is all the earth.
{19:6} And ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These the words which thou shalt speak to the sons of Israel.
{19:7} And Moses will go and will call to the old men of the people, and he will set before them all these words that Jehovah commanded him.
{19:8} And all the people will answer together, and will say, All which Jehovah spake, we will do. And Moses turned back the words of the people to Jehovah.
{19:9} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Behold me coming to thee in the darkness of the cloud, so that the people shall hear in my speaking with thee, and also in thee shall they believe forever. And Moses will announce the words of the people to Jehovah.
{19:10} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Go to the people and consecrate them this day, and the morrow; and they washed their garments,
{19:11} And be ye prepared for the third day, for in the third day Jehovah will come down before the eyes of all the people upon mount Sinai.
{19:12} And set bounds to the people round about, saying, Watch for yourselves to go up into the mount, and to touch upon its extremity: every one touching upon the mount, dying, shall die.
{19:13} No hand shall touch upon it, for being stoned, he shall be stoned, or being shot, shall be shot; whether quadruped or man, it shall not live: in protracting the shouting, they shall go up upon the mount.
{19:14} And Moses will come down from the mount to the people, and he will consecrate the people; and they will wash their garments.
{19:15} And he will say to the people, Be prepared; for three days ye shall not come near to a woman.
{19:16} And it shall be in the third day, it being in the morning, and there shall be voices, and lightnings, and a heavy cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceedingly strong; and all the people in the camp will tremble.
{19:17} And Moses will bring forth the people to the meeting of God out of the camp; and they will stand in the lower parts of the mount.
{19:18} And mount Sinai smoked all of it, because that Jehovah came down upon it in fire: and its smoke will go up as the smoke of the furnace, and all the mountain will tremble exceedingly.
{19:19} And the voice of the trumpet will be going and strengthening exceedingly, Moses will speak and God will answer him by a voice.
{19:20} And Jehovah will come down upon mount Sinai to the head of the mount: and Jehovah will call for Moses to the head of the mount and Moses will go up.
{19:21} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Go down: protest to the people lest they shall break in to Jehovah to see, and a multitude fall from them.
{19:22} And also the priests drawing near to Jehovah, shall be consecrated, lest Jehovah shall break forth upon them.
{19:23} And Moses will say to Jehovah, The people shall not be able to come up to mount Sinai, for thou didst protest to us, saying, Set bounds to the mountain, and consecrate it.
{19:24} And Jehovah will say to him, Go; come down, and come up, thou and Aaron with thee: and the priests and the people shall not break in to come up to Jehovah lest he shall break forth upon them.
{19:25} And Moses will come down to the people and will say to them.
{20:1} And God will speak all these words, saying,
{20:2} I am Jehovah thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants.
{20:3} There shall be no other God to thee to my face.
{20:4} Thou shalt not make to thee a carved image, and every appearance that is in the heavens above, and that is in the earth beneath, and that is in the water under the earth.
{20:5} Thou shalt not worship to them, and thou shalt not serve them: for I am Jehovah thy God, a jealous God, striking the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and to the fourth, to them hating me;
{20:6} And doing kindness to thousands to them loving me and to them watching my commands.
{20:7} Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain: for Jehovah will not cleanse him who shall take his name in vain.
{20:8} Remember the day of the Sabbath to consecrate it.
{20:9} Six days thou shalt work and do all thy service:
{20:10} And the seventh day the Sabbath to Jehovah thy God: thou shall do no service, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy servant, and thy maid, and thy cattle, and thy stranger which is in thy gates.
{20:11} For six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all which is in them, and he will rest in the seventh day: for this Jehovah praised the seventh day and consecrated it.
{20:12} Honor thy father and thy mother, so that thy days shall be prolonged upon the land which Jehovah thy gave to thee.
{20:13} Thou shalt not kill.
{20:14} Thou shalt not commit adultery.
{20:15} Thou shalt not steal.
{20:16} Thou shalt not testify against thy friend for falsehood.
{20:17} Thou shalt not desire thy friend's house, thou shalt not desire thy friend's wife, and his servant and his maid and his ox and his ass and all which is to thy friend.
{20:18} And all the people saw the voices and the flames, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and the people feared, and they will shake, and they will stand from far off.
{20:19} And they will say to Moses, Speak thou with us and we will hear: and God shall not speak with us lest we shall die.
{20:20} And Moses will say to the people, Ye shall not fear; for for this cause God came to try you, that his fear shall be to your faces, so that ye shall not sin.
{20:21} And the people will stand from far off, and Moses will draw near to the darkness where God is there.
{20:22} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Thus shalt thou say to the sons of Israel, Ye saw that from the heavens I spake with you.
{20:23} Ye shall not make to me gods of silver, and gods of gold ye shall not make to yourselves.
{20:24} An altar of earth shalt thou make to me, and sacrifice upon it thy burnt-offering and thy peace, and thy sheep and thy cattle: and in every place where I shall cause my name to be remembered, I will come to thee and bless thee.
{20:25} And if thou shalt make to me an altar of stones, thou shalt not build them, cutting, for didst thou lift up thy sword upon it, and thou shalt defile it.
{20:26} And thou shalt not go up by steps upon mine altar, that thou shalt not uncover thy nakedness upon it.
{21:1} And these the judgments which thou shalt set before them.
{21:2} If thou shalt buy a Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve: and in the seventh he shall go forth free gratuitously.
{21:3} If he shall come in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he possessed a wife, and his wife shall go forth with him.
{21:4} If his lord shall give to hint a wife, and she brought to him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be to her lord, and he shall go forth by himself.
{21:5} And if saying, the servant shall say, I loved my lord, my wife and my sons; I will not go forth free:
{21:6} And his lord brought him near to God, and he brought him near to the door, or to the door-post, and his lord pierced his ear with an awl; and he served him forever.
{21:7} And if a man shall sell his daughter for a maid, she shall not go forth as the servants went forth.
{21:8} If evil in the eyes of her lord, he did not betroth her and he ransomed her: to a strange people he shall not have power to sell her, in his acting deceitfully by her.
{21:9} And if to a son he shall betroth her, according to the judgment of daughters he shall do to her.
{21:10} If he shall take to him another, her food and her covering and her cohabitation he shall not take away.
{21:11} And if he shall not do these three to her, she shall go forth gratuitously without silver.
{21:12} He striking a man and he died, dying, he shall die.
{21:13} And when he hunted not after, and God let fall into his hand, and I set to thee a place where he shall flee there.
{21:14} And if a man shall act proudly against his friend to kill him with craftiness, from mine altar shalt thou take him to die.
{21:15} And he striking his father and his mother, dying be shall die.
{21:16} And he stealing a man, and selling him, and being found in his hand, dying, he shall die.
{21:17} And he making light of his father and his mother, dying, he shall die.
{21:18} And if men shall contend, and a man struck his friend with a stone or with the fist, and he shall not die, and he fell upon the bed:
{21:19} If he shall rise and go forth without upon his support, and he smiting being innocent, only he shall give his resting, and healing, he shall be healed.
{21:20} And if a man shall strike his servant or his maid with a rod, and he died under his hand, avenging, he shall be avenged.
{21:21} But if a day or two days he shall stand, he shall not be avenged, for he is his silver.
{21:22} And if men shall quarrel and strike a woman pregnant, and her child shall go forth, and there shall not be harm, punishing, he shall be punished, as the husband of the woman shall put upon him; and he giving in justice.
{21:23} And if there shall be harm, and he gave soul for soul,
{21:24} Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
{21:25} Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
{21:26} And if a man strike the eye of his servant or the eye of his maid, and he destroyed it; he shall send him forth free for the sake of his eye.
{21:27} And if the tooth of his servant or the tooth of his maid he shall cast out, he shall send him forth free for his tooth.
{21:28} And if an ox shall push (with the horns) a man or a woman, and he died; stoning, the ox shall be stoned, and he shall not eat his flesh; and the lord of the ox being innocent.
{21:29} And if this ox pushed (with the horns) from yesterday the third day, and being testified to its lord, and he will not watch him and he killed the man or the woman; the ox shall be stoned, and also his lord shall be put to death.
{21:30} If an expiation shall be put upon him, the price of redemption of his soul according to all which shall be put upon him.
{21:31} If he shall push (with his horns) a son, or shall push a daughter, according to this judgment it shall be done to him.
{21:32} If the ox shall push a servant, or a maid, he shall give thirty shekels of silver to his lord, and the ox shall be stoned.
{21:33} And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and shall not cover it, and an ox fall there, or an ass:
{21:34} The lord of the pit shall recompense; he shall turn back silver to his lord and the dead shall be to him.
{21:35} And if a man's ox shall strike the ox of his friend and he died, and they shall sell the living ox and divide the silver, and also the dead ox they shall divide.
{21:36} Or if this ox was known to push from yesterday, the third day, and his lord guarded him not; recompensing, he shall recompense, ox for ox, and the dead shall be to him.
{22:1} If a man shall steal an ox or a sheep, and slaughter it or sell it, he shall recompense five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
{22:2} If in breaking in a thief shall be found, and he was smitten and died, no bloods for him.
{22:3} If the sun was risen upon him, bloods for him: recompensing, he shall recompense; if nothing to him, to be sold for his theft.
{22:4} If finding, the theft shall be found in his hand, from an ox to an ass, to a sheep; living, he shall recompense two.
{22:5} If a man shall feed a field or vineyard, and send forth the cattle and feed in another field: from the good of his field and from the good of his vineyard shall he recompense.
{22:6} If fire shall come forth, and find thorns, and it consume the heap of sheaves or stalk of grain, or the field; he having kindled the fire, recompensing, he shall recompense.
{22:7} If a man shall give to his friend silver or vessels to watch, and it was stolen out of the man's house, if the thief shall be found he shall recompense double.
{22:8} If the thief shall not be found, and the lord of the house being brought to God, if he put not forth his hand upon his friend's goods.
{22:9} For every word of transgression, for ox, for ass, for sheep, for garment, for every loss which if this say is his: to God the word of both of them shall come; whom God shall condemn, he shall recompense double to his friend.
{22:10} If a man shall give to his friend an ass or ox or sheep or all cattle to watch; and it died, or being broken or being taken captive, not being seen:
{22:11} An oath of Jehovah shall be between them both if he put not forth his hand to his friend's goods; and its lord shall take and he shall not recompense.
{22:12} And if stealing, it shall be stolen from him, he shall recompense to his lord.
{22:13} If tearing in pieces, it shall be torn in pieces, he shall bring it a witness; the torn in pieces he shall not recompense.
{22:14} And if a man shall ask from his friend, and being broken or dying, its lord not with it, recompensing, he shall recompense.
{22:15} If its lord be with it, he shall not recompense: if hired, it came for its hire.
{22:16} If a man shall seduce a virgin who was not betrothed, and lying with her, endowing, he shall endow her to him for a wife.

{22:18} Thou shalt not preserve alive a sorceress.
{22:19} Every one lying with a quadruped, dying, shall die.
{22:20} He sacrificing to a God except to Jehovah himself alone, shall be devoted to destruction.
{22:21} Thou shalt not treat evil the stranger, and thou shalt not press him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
{22:22} Every widow and orphan ye shall not afflict.
{22:23} If afflicting, thou shalt afflict him, if crying, he shall cry to me, hearing, I will hear his cry.
{22:24} And my anger kindling, I killed you with the sword; and your wives were widows, and your sons orphans.
{22:25} If thou shalt lend silver to my people being poor with thee, thou shalt not be to him, as lending; ye shall not put interest upon him.
{22:26} If taking in pledge, thou shalt take in pledge the garment of thy friend, at the going down of the sun thou shalt turn it back to him.
{22:27} For it is his covering alone; his garment for his nakedness in which he shall lie; and it was when he shall cry to me, and I heard, for I am compassionate.
{22:28} Thou shalt not make light of God, and thou shalt not curse the chiefs of thy people.
{22:29} Thy fulness and thy tears thou shalt not delay: the first-born of thy sons thou shalt give to me.
{22:30} Thus shalt thou do to thine ox, to thy sheep: seven days shall it be with its mother; in the eighth day thou shalt give it to me.
{22:31} And ye shall be holy men to me, and ye shall not eat flesh torn in pieces in the field; ye shall cast it to the dog.
{23:1} Thou shalt not take up a false report: thou shalt not put thy hand with the unjust one to be a witness of wrong.
{23:2} Thou shalt not be after multitudes for evil; thou shalt not answer for the multitude to stretch out after multitudes to pervert justice.
{23:3} And the poor one thou shalt not make proud in his cause.
{23:4} If thou shalt meet thine enemy's ox or his ass wandering, turning back, thou shalt turn him back to him.
{23:5} If thou shalt see the ass of him hating thee, lying down under his load, and thou didst desist from cutting loose for him, releasing, thou shall release with him.
{23:6} Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of thy needy in his cause.
{23:7} From the word of falsehood thou shalt go far away; and the innocent and the just one thou shalt not kill: for I will not justify the unjust one.
{23:8} And thou shalt not take a gift; for the gift will blind the seeing, and will pervert just words.
{23:9} Thou shalt not press the stranger: and ye knew the soul of the stranger, for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
{23:10} Six years shalt thou sow thy land, and gather its produce:
{23:11} And the seventh thou shalt remit, and let it be; and the poor of thy people shall eat; and the remains, the beast of the field shall eat. So shalt thou do to thy vineyard and to thy olive tree.
{23:12} Six days thou shalt do thy works, and in the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox shall rest, and thine ass, and the son of thy maid shall be refreshed, and the stranger.
{23:13} And in all which I said to you ye shall watch; and ye shall not call to mind the name of other gods; it shall not be heard above thy mouth.
{23:14} Three times thou shalt keep a festival to me in the year.
{23:15} Thou shalt watch the festival of unleavened: seven days shalt thou eat unleavened as I commanded thee according to the appointment of the month Abib; for in it thou camest forth out of Egypt: and they shall not be seen before me empty.
{23:16} And the festival of the harvest, the first fruits of thy works, which thou shalt sow in the field: and the festival of gathering in the going out of the year, in thy gathering thy works out of the field.
{23:17} Three times in the year every male of thine shall be seen to the face of the Lord Jehovah.
{23:18} Thou shalt not sacrifice upon leaven: the blood of my sacrifice, and the fat of my festival shall not remain over till morning.
{23:19} The sacrifice of the first fruits of thy land thou shalt bring to the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in his mother's milk.
{23:20} Behold, I send a messenger before thee to guard thee in the way, and to bring thee to the place which I prepared.
{23:21} Watch from his face, and hear to his voice; thou shalt not rebel against him: he will not lift up your transgression; for my name is in the midst of him.
{23:22} For if hearing thou shalt hear to his voice, and to all that I shall speak; and I was an enemy to thine enemies, and I was hostile to thine adversaries.
{23:23} For my messenger shall go before thee, and bring thee to the Amorites, and the Hittites and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites and the Jebusites; and I destroyed them.
{23:24} Thou shalt not worship to their gods, and thou shalt not serve them, and thou shalt not do according to their works: for destroying, thou shalt destroy them, and breaking, thou shalt break in pieces their pillars.
{23:25} And serve ye Jehovah your God, and he blessed thy bread, and thy waters; and I turned away disease from the midst of thee.
{23:26} And there shall not be bereaving of children or barren upon thy land: the number of thy days I will fill up.
{23:27} I will send my terror before thee and I killed all the people which thou shalt come to them; and I gave all thine enemies the back to thee.
{23:28} And I sent hornets before thee and to drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before thee.
{23:29} I will not drive them out from thy face in one year, lest the land shall be desolate, and the beast of the field multiply upon thee.
{23:30} By little and little I will drive them out from thy face, till when thou shalt be fruitful and thou didst inherit the land.
{23:31} And I put thy bounds from the sea of sedge, and even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert even to the river: for I will give into your hand those inhabiting the land, and thou drove them out from before thee.
{23:32} Thou shalt not make a covenant with them and to their gods.
{23:33} They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they shall cause thee to sin against me: if thou shalt serve their gods, surely shall it be to thee for a snare.

{24:9} And Moses will go up, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy from the old men of Israel.
{24:10} And they will see the God of Israel: and under his feet as the work of the whiteness of sapphire, and as the body of the heavens for cleanness.
{24:11} And to the sides of the sons of Israel he stretched not forth his hand: and they will see God, and eat and drink.
{24:12} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Come up to me to the mountain, and be there: and I will give to thee tablets of stone, and the law and the commands which I wrote, to teach them.
{24:13} And Moses will rise up, and Joshua, his minister; and Moses will go up to the mountain of God.
{24:14} And he said to the old men, Abide for us here, till when we shall turn back to you: and behold, Aaron and Hur with you; whoever having words shall draw near to them.
{24:15} And Moses will go up to the mountain and the cloud will cover the mount.

{25:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{25:2} Speak to the sons of Israel, and they shall take for me an offering: from every man whose heart shall impel him, ye shall take my offerings.

{28:43} And they shall be upon Aaron and upon his sons in their going into the tent of the appointment, or in their drawing near to the altar to serve in the holy place; and they shall not lift up to sin and die. A law forever to him and to his seed after him.
{29:1} And this the word thou shall do to them to consecrate them, to be priests to me: Take one bullock, the son of a cow, two complete rams,
{29:2} And unleavened bread, and unleavened cakes, poured over with oil, and thin unleavened cakes, anointed with oil: of fine flour of wheat thou shalt make them.
{29:3} And put them upon one basket, and bring them near in the basket with the bullock and the two rams.
{29:4} And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring near to the door of the tent of the appointment, and wash them in water.
{29:5} And take the garments, and put upon Aaron the tunic and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breast-plate, and gird on him with the girdle of the ephod.

{29:8} And his sons thou shalt bring near and put tunics upon them.
{29:9} And gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and bind to them turbans; and the priesthood shall be to them for a law forever: and fill the hand of Aaron and the hand of his sons.
{29:10} And bring near the bullock before the tent of the appointment; and Aaron and his sons put their hands upon the head of the bullock,
{29:11} And slaughter the bullock before Jehovah at the door of the tent of the appointment.
{29:12} And take from the blood of the bullock, and give upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and all the blood thou shalt pour at the foundation of the altar.
{29:13} And take all the fat of the covering upon the bowels, and the lobes upon the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn upon the altar.
{29:14} And the flesh of the bullock and his skin, and his dung shalt thou burn with fire from without the camp: this the sin.
{29:15} And the one ram thou shalt take; and Aaron and his sons put their hands upon the head of the ram.
{29:16} And slaughter the ram, and take his blood and sprinkle upon the altar round about.
{29:17} And the ram thou shalt cut into his pieces, and wash his bowels, and his legs, and give upon his pieces and upon his head.
{29:18} And burn all the ram upon the altar: this a burnt-offering to Jehovah: this a sacrifice, a smell of a sweet odor to Jehovah.
{29:19} And take the second ram; and Aaron put, and his sons, their hands upon the head of the ram.
{29:20} And slaughter the ram, and take from his blood, and give upon the extremity of the ear of Aaron, and upon the extremity of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
{29:21} And take from the blood that is upon the altar, and of the oil of anointing, and sprinkle upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be consecrated, and his garments and the garments of his sons with him.
{29:22} And take from the ram the fat and the fat tail, and the fat covering the bowels, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat which is upon them, and the right leg, for it is a ram of fulness.
{29:23} And one round of bread, and one cake of fat bread, and one thin cake from the basket of the unleavened that is before Jehovah.
{29:24} And put all upon the hands of Aaron and upon the hands of his sons; and lift them up a waving before Jehovah.
{29:25} And thou shalt take them from their hand and burn upon the altar upon the burnt-offering for a smell of sweet odor before Jehovah: this a sacrifice to Jehovah.
{29:26} And take the breast from the ram of completion which is to Aaron, and lift up a waving before Jehovah: and it was to thee for a portion.
{29:27} And consecrate the breast of the waving and the shoulder of the offering, which shall be lifted up, and which is lifted up from the ram of fulness from that to Aaron, and from that to his sons.
{29:28} And it was to Aaron and to his sons for a law forever from the sons of Israel: for it is an offering; and it shall be an offering from the sons of Israel from the sacrifices of peace their offerings to Jehovah.
{29:29} And the garments of the holy place which are to Aaron shall be to his sons after him to anoint them in them, and to fill in them their hands.
{29:30} Seven days he from his sons being priest in his stead, shall put them on when he shall come into the tent of the appointment to serve in the holy place.
{29:31} And the ram of completion thou shalt take and boil his flesh in the holy place.
{29:32} And Aaron shall eat and his sons, the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the of appointment.
{29:33} And they shall eat these which covered up in them to fill their hand to consecrate them: and a stranger shall not eat for they are holy.
{29:34} And if there shall remain from the flesh of the completions, and from the bread, till the morning, burn the remainder with fire, for it shall not be eaten for it is holy.
{29:35} And do to Aaron and to his sons, thus according to all which I commanded thee: seven days shalt thou fill their hand.
{29:36} And the bullock of sin, thou shalt do in the day of expiations, and make an atonement upon the altar in thy making an atonement upon its and anoint it to consecrate it.
{29:37} Seven days thou shalt expiate upon the altar, and consecrate it; and it was the holy altar of holies: all touching upon the altar shall be holy.
{29:38} This which thou shalt do upon the altar; two he lambs the sons of a year for the day continually.
{29:39} The one he lamb thou shalt do in the morning; and the second he lamb thou shalt do between the two evenings.
{29:40} A tenth of fine flour mixed with beaten oil, the fourth of an hin, and a libation, the fourth of an hin of wine, for the one he lamb.
{29:41} And the second he lamb thou shalt do between the two evenings, according to the sacrifice of the morning, and according to its libation, thou shalt do it for a smell of sweet odor, a sacrifice to Jehovah.
{29:42} A burnt-offering of continuance for your generations at the door of the tent of appointment before Jehovah, where I will meet with you there, to speak to thee there.
{29:43} And I met with the sons of Israel there; and it shall be consecrated by my glory.
{29:44} And I consecrated the tent of appointment, and the altar; and Aaron and his sons I will consecrate to be priests to me.
{29:45} And I dwelt in the midst of the sons of Israel, and I was to them for God.
{29:46} And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, to dwell in the midst of them; I Jehovah their God.
{30:1} And make an altar for burning incense: of acacia wood shalt thou make it.
{30:2} A cubit its length, a cubit its breadth; it shall be four-square; and two cubits its height: its horns out of it.
{30:3} And spread it over with pure gold its top, and its walls round about, and its horns: and make to it a gold wreath round about.
{30:4} And two gold rings shalt thou make to it from under its crown, upon its two ribs, shalt thou make upon its two sides; and it was for inner parts for staves to lift it up by them.
{30:5} And make staves of acacia wood, and spread them over with gold.
{30:6} And give it before the vail that is upon the ark of the testimonies, before the cover which is upon the testimonies, where I will meet with thee there.

{30:8} And in Aaron's causing the lamps, to ascend between the two evenings, he shall burn incense upon it; continually before Jehovah for your generations.
{30:9} And ye shall not bring up upon it strange incense; and a burnt-offering, a sacrifice and a libation thou shalt not pour out upon it.
{30:10} And Aaron to expiate upon its horns once in a year, from the blood of the sin of the expiation: once in a year he shall expiate upon it for your generations: it is holy of holies to Jehovah.
{30:11} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{30:12} When thou shalt take up the head of the sons of Israel for their reviewing, and they gave each a ransom of his soul to Jehovah, and in reviewing them; and a stumble shall not be in them in reviewing them.
{30:13} This they shall give, all passing by upon their reviewing, from half the shekel by the holy shekel; (twenty gerahs the shekel:) from half a shekel an offering to Jehovah.
{30:14} All passing by upon their reviewing, from the son of twenty years and above, shall give an offering to Jehovah.
{30:15} The rich one shall not multiply, and the poor one shall not diminish from half the shekel, to give an offering to Jehovah to expiate for your souls.
{30:16} And take the silver of the expiations from the sons of Israel and give it for the work of the tent of appointment; and it was for the sons of Israel a remembrance before Jehovah to expiate for your souls.
{30:17} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{30:18} Make a brass wash-basin, and its pedestal brass, for washing: and give it between the tent of appointment and between the altar, and give water there.
{30:19} And Aaron and his son washed from it their hands and their feet.
{30:20} In their coming into the tent of appointment, they shall wash with water, and they shall not die: or in their drawing near to the altar to serve, to burn a sacrifice to Jehovah.
{30:21} And they shall wash their hands and their feet, and they shall not die: and it was to them a law forever, to him and to his seed and to their generations.
{30:22} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying.
{30:23} Take thou to thee spices of head of flowing myrrh, five hundred: and fragrant cinnamon of its half, fifty and two hundred; and fragrant reed, fifty and two hundred.
{30:24} And cassia, five hundred by the holy shekel, and the oil of olive, a hin:
{30:25} And make it an oil a holy anointing, a perfumed unguent the work of the perfumer: it shall be an oil a holy anointing.
{30:26} And anoint the tent of appointment, and the ark of the testimony,
{30:27} And the table and all its vessels and the chandelier and its vessels, and the altar of incense,
{30:28} And the altar of burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the wash-basin and its pedestal.
{30:29} And consecrate them, and they shall be holy of holies; every one touching upon them shall be holy.
{30:30} And Aaron and his sons thou shalt anoint and consecrate them to be priests to me.
{30:31} And to the sons of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, An oil a holy anointing shall this be to me for your generations.
{30:32} Upon the flesh of man it shall not be poured, and according to its measure ye shall not make like it: it is holy; holy shall it be to you.
{30:33} A man who shall perfume like it, and shall give to the stranger, and he shall be cut off from his people.
{30:34} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Take to thee aromatics, resin, and onycha, and galbanum; aromatics and pure frankincense: it shall be part for part.
{30:35} And make it a perfume, an ointment, a work of the perfumer, salted, pure, holy.
{30:36} And pound fine from it to small dust, and give from it before the testimony in the tent of appointment where I will meet with thee there: holy of holies, shall it be to you.
{30:37} And the perfume which thou shalt make, according to its measure ye shall not make to you: it shall be holy to you for Jehovah.
{30:38} A man who shall make like it to smell in it, and he shall be cut off from his people.
{31:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, Saying,
{31:2} See, I called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
{31:3} And I will fill him with the spirit of God, in wisdom and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all work.
{31:4} To meditate work of skill, to work in gold and in silver and in brass.
{31:5} And in graving stone for filling up, and in graving wood, to work in all work.
{31:6} And I, behold, I gave him Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all the wise of heart I gave wisdom; and they shall make all which I commanded thee:
{31:7} The tent of appointment, and the ark of testimony, and the cover which is upon it, and all the vessels of the tent,
{31:8} And the table and its vessels, and the pure chandelier and all its vessels, and the altar of incense,
{31:9} And the altar of burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the wash-basin and its base,
{31:10} And the garments of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons to be priests,
{31:11} The oil of anointing, and the incense of aromatics for the holy place: according to all which I commanded thee they shall do.
{31:12} And Jehovah will say to Moses, saying.
{31:13} Speak thou to the sons of Israel, saying, Verily my Sabbaths shall ye watch: for it is a sign between me and between you for your generations, to know that I am Jehovah consecrating you.
{31:14} And watch ye the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. He profaning it, dying, shall die; for all doing work in it, and that soul shall be cut off from the midst of his people.
{31:15} Six days shall work be done, and the seventh day the Sabbath, a holy rest to Jehovah: all doing work in the day of the Sabbath, dying, shall die.
{31:16} And the sons of Israel shall watch the Sabbath to do the Sabbath for their generation, a covenant forever.
{31:17} Between me and between the sons of Israel it is a sign forever: for six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, and in the seventh day he rested and he will be refreshed.
{31:18} And he will give to Moses when he ceased to speak to him in mount Sinai, two tables of the testimony, tables of stone written by the finger of God.
{32:1} And the people will see that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, and the people will assemble to Aaron, and will say to him, Arise, make to us gods who shall go before us: for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we shall not know what was to him.
{32:2} And Aaron will say to them, Break off the gold ear-rings which are in the ears of your wives, your sons and your daughters, and bring to me.
{32:3} And all the people will break off the gold ear-rings which are in their ears, and they will bring to Aaron.
{32:4} And he will take from their hand, and will form it with a graver, and he will make it a molten calf: and they will say, These thy gods, Israel, who brought thee up from the land of Egypt.
{32:5} And Aaron will see, and he will build an altar before it; and Aaron will call and say, A festival to Jehovah tomorrow.
{32:6} And they will rise early early on the morrow, and they will raise up a burnt-offering, and they will bring near peace; and the people will sit down to eat and drink, and they will rise up to play.
{32:7} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, Go, descend: for thy people were corrupted whom thou didst bring up out of the land of Egypt.
{32:8} For they turned aside quickly from the way which I commanded them: they made for them a molten calf, and worship to it, and will sacrifice to it, and will say, These thy gods, Israel, which raised thee up out of the land of Egypt.
{32:9} And Jehovah will say to Moses, I saw this people, and behold, it a people of a hard neck.
{32:10} And thou be at rest to me, and my wrath shall kindle against them, and I will consume them: and I will make thee into a great nation.
{32:11} And Moses will supplicate the face of Jehovah, his God, and will say, For what will thy wrath kindle against thy people which thou didst bring forth out of the land of Egypt by thy great power and with a strong hand?
{32:12} Lest the Egyptians shall speak, saying, With evil he brought them forth to kill them in the mountains, and to finish them from the face of the earth. Turn back from the heat of thy wrath, and repent concerning evil towards thy people.
{32:13} Remember Abraham, Isaak, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou didst swear to them by thyself, and thou wilt speak to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and all this land which I said, I will give to your seed and they inherited forever.
{32:14} And Jehovah repented concerning the evil which he spake to do to his people.
{32:15} And Moses will turn and will go down from the mount, and the two tables of testimony in his hand: the tables were written from the two opposite sides; from hence and from thence they were written.
{32:16} And the tables they the work of God, and the writing the writing of God, it being cut in the tables.
{32:17} And Joshua will hear the voice of the people in making a loud noise, and he will say to Moses, A voice of war in the camp.
{32:18} And he will say, Not the voice of the shouting of victory, and not the voice of the shouting of defeat: the voice of shouting I heard.
{32:19} And it will be when he drew near to the camp, and he will see the calf and the lute: and the wrath of Moses will kindle, and he will cast the tables out of his hand, and he will break them under the mount.
{32:20} And he will take the calf which they made, and will burn it in fire, and which he will crush even to small dust, and will scatter upon the face of the water, and will give the sons of Israel to drink.
{32:21} And Moses will say to Aaron, What did this people to thee that thou didst bring upon it a great sin?
{32:22} And Aaron will say, The wrath of my lord shall not kindle: thou knowest the people that it is in sin.
{32:23} And they will say to me; Make to us gods which shall go before us: for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we knew not what was to him.
{32:24} And I said to them, To whom is gold, he shall break it off. And they will give it to me, and I shall cast it into the fire and this calf will come out.
{32:25} And Moses will see the people that it was uncovered (for Aaron uncovered it for overthrow among their enemies).
{32:26} And Moses will stand in the gate of the camp, and will say, Who for Jehovah? to me. And all the sons of Levi will assemble together to him.
{32:27} And he will say to them, Thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, Put ye each his sword upon his thigh, and pass ye through and turn ye back from gate to gate in the camp, and slay ye each his brother, and each his friend, and each his near one.
{32:28} And the sons of Levi will do according to the word of Moses: and there will fall from the people in that day about three thousand men.
{32:29} And Moses will say, Fill your hand this day to Jehovah, for each upon his son and upon his brother, to give to you a blessing this day.
{32:30} And it shall be from the morrow, and Moses will say to the people, Ye sinned a great sin: and now I will go up to Jehovah; perhaps I shall expiate for your sin.
{32:31} And Moses will turn back to Jehovah, and say, Ah, now, this people sinned a great sin, and they will make to them golden gods.
{32:32} And now if thou wilt, lift up their sin; and if not, wipe me off from thy book which thou didst write.
{32:33} And Jehovah will say to Moses, whoever that sinned against me I will wipe him off from my book.
{32:34} And now go, lead the people to where I spake to thee: behold, my messenger shall go before thee: and in the day of my reviewing, and I reviewed upon them their sin.
{32:35} And Jehovah will smite the people for their making the calf which Aaron made.
{33:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, Go, come up from here, thou, and the people which thou didst bring up out of the land of Egypt to the land which I sware to Abraham, to Isaak, and to Jacob, saying, to thy seed will I give it.
{33:2} And I sent a messenger before thee, and I drove out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
{33:3} To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a people of a hard neck; lest I shall consume thee in the way.
{33:4} And the people will hear this evil word, and they will mourn: and they put not each his ornaments upon him.
{33:5} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Say to the sons of Israel, Ye are a people of a hard neck: one moment I will come up in the midst of thee, and finish thee: and now bring down thy ornaments from thee, and I shall know what I shall do to thee.
{33:6} And the sons of Israel will take away their ornaments from mount Horeb.
{33:7} And Moses will take the tent and stretched it from without the camp afar off from the camp, and he called it the tent of appointment And it was every one seeking Jehovah went forth to the tent of appointment, which is from without the camp.
{33:8} And it was when Moses went forth to the tent, all the people will rise up, and they stood each at the door of his tent, and they looked after Moses till his going into the tent.
{33:9} And it was as Moses went to the tent, the pillar of the cloud came down and stood at the door of the tent, and spake with Moses.
{33:10} And all the people saw the pillar of the cloud standing at the door of the tent: and all the people rose up and worshipped it, each at the door of his tent.
{33:11} And Jehovah spake to Moses face to face, as a man will speak to his friend. And he turned back to the camp; and his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not from the midst of the tent.
{33:12} And Moses will say to Jehovah, See, thou sayest to me, Bring up this people: and thou madest not known to me whom thou wilt send with me. And thou saidst, I knew thee by name, and also thou didst find favor in mine eyes.
{33:13} And now, if now I found grace in thine eyes, make known to me now thy way, and I shall know thee, so that I shall find grace in thine eyes: and see that thy people is this nation.
{33:14} And he will say, My face and my rest shall go to thee.
{33:15} And he will say to him, If thy face led them not, thou wilt not bring us up from here.
{33:16} And in what shall it be known here that I found favor in thine eyes, I and thy people? Is it not in thy going with us? and we shall be distinguished, I and thy people, above all the people which are upon the face of the earth.
{33:17} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Also this word which thou spakest, I will do: for thou didst find grace in mine eyes and I shall know thee by name.
{33:18} And he will say, Cause me now to see thy glory.
{33:19} And he will say, I will cause all my good to pass by before thee, and I called upon the name of Jehovah before thee; and I compassionated whom I will compassionate, and I pitied whom I will pity.
{33:20} And he will say, Thou shalt not be able to see my face: for none shall see my face, and live.
{33:21} And Jehovah will say, Behold, a place with me, and stand thou upon the rock.
{33:22} And it was in the passing by of my glory, and I put thee in a cavern of the rock; and I hedged in with my hand upon thee till I passed by.
{33:23} And I turned aside my hand, and thou sawest behind me: and they shall not see my face.
{34:1} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Carve to thyself two tables of stones like as the first: and I wrote upon the tables the words which were upon the first tables which thou didst brake.
{34:2} And be prepared at morning, and come up in the morning to mount Sinai, and stand by me there upon the head of the mount.
{34:3} And no man shall come up with thee, and also a man shall not be seen in all the mountain: also the sheep and the cattle shall not feed before that mountain.
{34:4} And he will carve the two tables of stones as the first; and Moses will rise early in the morning, and will go up to the mount Sinai as Jehovah commanded him, and he will take in his hand the two stone tables.
{34:5} And Jehovah will come down in a cloud, and he will stand with him there, and will call upon the name of Jehovah.
{34:6} And Jehovah will pass by before him, and Jehovah will call, Jehovah God merciful and compassionate, deferring anger, and much in kindness and truth,
{34:7} Watching kindness for thousands, taking away iniquity, and transgression and sin, and acquitting, will not cleanse; striking the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons and upon the sons' sons, upon the third and the fourth.
{34:8} And Moses will hasten and bow down to the earth, and will worship.
{34:9} And he will say, If now I found grace in thine eyes, my lord, my lord will go now in the midst of us (for it is a people of a hard neck) and forgive our iniquity and our sin, and take possession of us.
{34:10} And he will say, Behold, I make a covenant before all thy people: and I will do wonders which were not created in all the earth, and in all nations; and all the people where thou art among them saw the work of Jehovah: for it is a fearful thing which I do with thee.
{34:11} Watch to thyself what I command thee this day: behold me driving out from before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
{34:12} Watch to thyself lest thou shalt make a covenant with those dwelling in the land which thou goest upon it, lest it shall be for a snare in the midst of thee.
{34:13} For their altars thou shalt lay waste, and their pillars thou shalt break, and their images thou shalt cut off.
{34:14} For thou shalt not worship another God: for Jehovah, his name is Jealous; he is a jealous God.
{34:15} Lest thou shalt make a covenant to those dwelling in the land and they committed fornication after their gods, and sacrificed to their gods, and call to thee, and thou didst eat from his sacrifice;
{34:16} And thou didst take from his daughters to thy sons, and they committed fornication after their gods, and they made thy sons commit fornication after their gods.
{34:17} Thou shalt make to thee no molten gods.
{34:18} The festival of unleavened thou shalt watch. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened, which I commanded thee, for the appointment of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou earnest forth out of Egypt.
{34:19} All opening the womb is to me: all thy cattle, the male, the firstling of the ox or sheep.
{34:20} And the first-born of the ass thou shalt redeem with a sheep: and if thou shalt not ransom, thou shalt break his neck. Every first-born of thy sons thou shalt ransom, and he shall not be seen before me empty.
{34:21} Six days thou shalt work, and in the seventh day thou shalt cease: and in ploughing and in harvest thou shalt cease.
{34:22} And the festival of seven thou shalt make to thee, the first fruits of the harvest of wheat, and the festival of collection of the circuit of the year.
{34:23} Three times in the year all thy males shall be seen before the Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel.
{34:24} For I will dispossess the nations from before thee; and I enlarged thy bound: and a man shall not desire thy land in thy coming up to see the face of Jehovah thy God, three times in the year.
{34:25} Thou shalt not slaughter upon leaven, the blood of my sacrifice; and the sacrifice of the festival of the pass over shall not be left to morning.
{34:26} The first of the first fruits of thy land thou shalt bring to the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in his mother's milk.
{34:27} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Write to thyself these words; for upon the mouth of these words, I made a covenant with thee and with Israel.
{34:28} And he will be there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he ate not bread and drank not water. And he will write upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten words.
{34:29} And it shall be in Moses' coming down from the mount Sinai (and the two tables of testimony in. Moses' hand in his coming down from the mount) and Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone in his speaking with him.
{34:30} And Aaron and all the sons of Israel will see Moses, and behold, the skin of his face shone; and they will fear coming near to him.
{34:31} And Moses will call to them; and Aaron and all the chiefs of the assembly will turn back to him: and Moses will speak to them.
{34:32} And after this all the sons of Israel drew near: and he will command them all what Jehovah spake to him in mount Sinai.
{34:33} And Moses will finish speaking to them and he will give a vail upon his face.
{34:34} And in Moses' going in before Jehovah to speak with him, he will turn away the covering till his coming out And he will come forth and speak to the sons of Israel what will be commanded.
{34:35} And the sons of Israel saw the face of Moses that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses turned back the vail upon his face till his going in to speak with him.
{35:1} And Moses will convoke together all the assembly of the sons of Israel, and will say to them, These the words which Jehovah commanded to do them.
{35:2} Six days thou shalt do work and in the seventh day a holy cessation, a cessation to Jehovah: all doing work in it shall die.
{35:3} Ye shall not burn a fire in all your dwellings in the day of the rest.
{35:4} And Moses will say to all the assembly of the sons of Israel, saying, This the word which Jehovah commanded, saying,

{35:29} Every man and woman whose heart impelled them to bring for all the work which Jehovah commanded to be done by the hand of Moses, the sons of Israel brought a voluntary gift to Jehovah.
{35:30} And Moses will say to the sons of Israel, See, Jehovah called by name Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
{35:31} And he will fill him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all work;

{36:3} And they will take from before Moses all the offering which the sons of Israel brought for the work of the service of the holy place to do it. And they brought to him yet a voluntary gift in the morning by morning.
{36:4} And all the wise will come, doing the work of the holy place; a man a man from his work which they were doing.
{36:5} And they will say to Moses, saying, The people are multiplying to bring more than enough to the service for the work which Jehovah commanded to do it.
{36:6} And Moses will command, and they will make a voice pass through in the camp, saying, A man and woman shall do no more work for the offering of the holy place. And the people will withhold from bringing.
{36:7} And the work was enough for all the work to do it, and more than enough.

{40:33} And he will raise up the enclosure round about to the dwelling and to the altar, and he will give the covering of the gate of the enclosure: and Moses will finish the work.
{40:34} And a cloud will cover the tent of appointment, and the glory of Jehovah filled the dwelling.
{40:35} And Moses was not able to come in to the tent of appointment, for the cloud settled down upon it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the dwelling.
{40:36} And in the going up of the cloud from above the dwelling, the sons of Israel removed in all their departures.
{40:37} And if the cloud shall not go up, they will not remove till the day it went up.
{40:38} For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the dwelling the day, and fire was upon it the night, in the eyes of all the house of Israel in all their departures.
