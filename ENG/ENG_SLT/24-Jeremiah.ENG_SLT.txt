{1:1} The words of Jeremiah son of Hillkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
{1:2} When the word of Jehovah was to him in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year to his reigning.
{1:3} And it will be in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, even to the fulness of the eleventh year to Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, even to the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
{1:4} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{1:5} Before I shall form thee in the belly, I knew thee; and before thou shalt go forth from the womb I consecrated thee; I gave thee a prophet to the nations.
{1:6} And saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah, behold I knew not to speak: for I a boy.
{1:7} And Jehovah will say to me, Thou shalt not say, I a boy; for thou shalt go to all to whom I shall send thee, and all which I shall command thee thou shalt speak.
{1:8} Thou shalt not be afraid of their faces, for I am with thee to deliver thee, says Jehovah.
{1:9} And Jehovah will stretch forth his hand and touch upon my mouth: and Jehovah will say to me, Behold, I gave my words into thy mouth.
{1:10} See, I appointed thee this day over the nations and over the kingdoms to pluck up and to tear down, and to destroy, and to overthrow, to build and to plant.
{1:11} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying, What seem thou, Jeremiah? and saying, I see the shoot of an almond tree.
{1:12} And Jehovah will say to me, Thou didst well to see; for I watch upon my word to do it.
{1:13} And the word of Jehovah will be to me the second time, saying, What seest thou? and saying, I see a pot blown under, and its face from the face of the north.
{1:14} And Jehovah will say to me, From the north shall evil be opened upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
{1:15} For behold me calling to all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says Jehovah; and they came, and gave a man his throne at the opening of the gates of Jerusalem, and upon all her walls round about and upon all the cities of Judah.
{1:16} And I spake my judgment with them concerning all their evil, who forsook me, and they will burn incense to other gods, and they will worship to the works of their hands.
{1:17} And thou shalt gird thy loins and rise and speak to them all that I shall command thee: thou shalt not be terrified from their face lest I shall break thee before them.
{1:18} Behold, I gave thee this day for a fortified city and for a pillar of iron and for a wall of brass upon all the land to the kings of Judah, to her chiefs, to her priests, and to the people of the land.
{1:19} And they warred against thee; and they shall not prevail against thee, for I am with thee, says Jehovah, to deliver thee.
{2:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{2:2} Go and call in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said Jehovah, I remembered for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy completion, thy going after me in the desert in a land not, sown.
{2:3} Israel is holy to Jehovah, the beginning of the produce: all consuming him shall transgress; evil shall come upon them, says Jehovah.
{2:4} Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and the families of the house of Israel:
{2:5} Thus said Jehovah, What iniquity found your fathers in me that they removed far off from me, and went after vanity, and they became vain?
{2:6} And they said not, Where is Jehovah bringing us up out of the land of Egypt, causing us to go through the desert into a sterile land and a pit, through a land of drought and the shadow of death, through a land not a man passed through it, and not a man dwelt there?
{2:7} And I will bring you to the land of Carmel, to eat its fruit and its goodness; and ye will come and defile my land, and ye set mine inheritance for an abomination.
{2:8} The priests said not Where is Jehovah? and they holding the law knew me not: and the shepherds transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and they went After what will not profit.
{2:9} For this I will even contend, with you, says Jehovah, and with your sons' sons will I contend.
{2:10} For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider greatly, and see whether there was like this.
{2:11} Did a nation change their gods, and they no gods? and my people changed their glory for what will not profit.
{2:12} Be astonished, ye heavens, at this, and shudder; be ye greatly desolate, says Jehovah.
{2:13} For my people did two evils: they forsook me the fountain of living waters, to hew out for them wells, broken wells which will not hold water.
{2:14} Is Israel a servant? if he was born in the house wherefore was he for plunder?
{2:15} Upon him the young lions roared, they gave their voice, they will set his land for a desolation: his cities were burned from not being inhabited.
{2:16} Also the sons of Noph and Tahapanes, they will feed thee upon the crown of the head.
{2:17} Wilt thou not do this to thyself? thou didst forsake Jehovah thy God in the time of thy being led in the way.
{2:18} And now what to thee for the way of Egypt, to drink the water of Sihor? and what to thee to the way of Amur, to drink the water of the river?
{2:19} Thy wickedness shall correct thee, and thy turnings back shall convict thee: and know thou and see that evil and bitter thy forsaking Jehovah thy God, and that my fear was not to thee, says the Lord Jehovah of armies.
{2:20} For from of old I broke thy yoke, I burst thy bonds; and thou wilt say, I will not serve; for upon every high hill and under every green tree thou turnest one side, committing fornication:
{2:21} And I planted thee a vine of purple grapes, wholly a true seed: and how didst thou turn to me the removings of a strange vine?
{2:22} For if thou shalt wash thyself with nitre, and thou shalt increase to thee cleansing, thine iniquity was graven before me, says the Lord Jehovah.
{2:23} How wilt thou say, I was not defiled? I went not after the Baalims? See thy way in the valley, know what thou didst; a young she camel entangling her ways;
{2:24} A wild ass accustomed to the desert in gratifying her soul, panting after the wind in her heat; who shall turn her back? all seeking her will not be wearied; in her new moon they shall find her.
{2:25} Withhold thy foot from being barefoot, and thy throat from thirst: and thou wilt say, Despairing, no; for I loved strangers, and after them will I go.
{2:26} As the shame of the thief when he shall be found, so was the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their chiefs, and their priests, and their prophets,
{2:27} Saying to the wood, Thou my father; and to the stone, Thou didst bring me forth: for they turned to me the back of the neck and not their face: and in the time of their evil they will say, Arise, and save us.
{2:28} And where thy gods which thou didst make to thee? they will arise, if they shall save thee in the time of thine evil: for from the numbering of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah.
{2:29} Wherefore will ye contend against me? all ye transgressed against me, says Jehovah.
{2:30} In vain did I strike your sons; they received no instruction: your sword consumed the prophets as a lion destroying.
{2:31} O generation, see ye the word of Jehovah. Was I the desert to Israel? If a land of thick darkness? wherefore said my people, We had dominion, we will come no more to thee?
{2:32} Will a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her girdles? and my people forgat me days of no numbering.
{2:33} How wilt thou make good thy way to seek love? for this also thou didst teach the evil ones thy ways.
{2:34} Also in thy wings were found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: not by breaking in did I find them, but upon all these.
{2:35} And thou wilt say, Because I was innocent his anger turned back from me. Behold me judging thee for thy saying, I sinned not.
{2:36} Why wilt thou despise greatly to do the second time thy way? also thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt as thou wert ashamed of Assur.
{2:37} Also from this thou wilt go forth and thy hands upon thy head: for Jehovah rejected thy trusts and thou shalt not give success to them.
{3:1} Saying, If a man shall send away his wife, and she went from him and she was to another man, shall he yet turn back to her? Being defiled, shall not that land be defiled? and thou committedst fornication with many shepherds; and turn back to me, says Jehovah.
{3:2} Lift up thine eyes upon the naked hills and see where thou wert not lain with. Upon the ways thou didst sit for them as the ravens in the desert; and thou wilt defile the land with thy fornications and with thine evil.
{3:3} And the showers will be withheld, and the latter rain was not; and the forehead of a woman a harlot was to thee, and thou refusedst to be ashamed.
{3:4} From the time didst thou not call to me, My father, thou the friend of my youth?
{3:5} Will he guard forever? if he will watch to the end? Behold, I spake, and wilt thou do evil, and shalt thou be able?
{3:6} And Jehovah will say to me in the days of Josiah the king, Sawest thou what Israel turning back, did? She went up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and she will commit fornication there.
{3:7} And saying after she did all these, Thou shalt turn back to me. And she turned not back; and her faithless sister Judah will see it.
{3:8} And I shall see for all the causes that Israel turning away committed adultery, I sent her away and I shall give a writing of her cutting off to her; and her faithless sister Judah was not afraid, and she will go and commit fornication, she also.
{3:9} And it was her fornication being light, and she will defile the land, and she will commit adultery with stones and with woods.
{3:10} And also in all this her faithless sister Judah turned not back to me with all the heart, but in falsehood, says Jehovah.
{3:11} And Jehovah will say to me, Israel turning away justified her soul above faithless Judah.
{3:12} Go and call these words to the north, and say, Turn back, O Israel, turning away, says Jehovah; I will not cause my face to fall upon you: for I am merciful, says Jehovah, I will not guard forever.
{3:13} Only know thine iniquity that thou didst transgress against Jehovah thy God, and thou wilt scatter thy ways to strangers under every green tree, and to my voice ye heard not, says Jehovah.
{3:14} Turn back, ye sons having turned away, says Jehovah; for I was lord over you: and I took you one from a city and two from a family, and I brought you to Zion.
{3:15} And I gave to you shepherds according to my heart, and they fed you with knowledge and understanding.
{3:16} And it was that ye shall be multiplied and be fruitful in the land in those days, says Jehovah; they shall no more say, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah: and it shall not come up upon the heart, and they shall not remember upon it, and they shall not review and it shall be clone no more.
{3:17} In that time they shall call to Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah; and all nations assembled together to her to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem: and they shall no more go after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
{3:18} In those days the house of Judah shall go with the house of Israel, and they shall go together out of the land of the north to a land which I caused your fathers to inherit.
{3:19} And I said, How shall I place thee among the sons, and I will give to thee a land of desire, an inheritance of glory of the armies of nations? And saying, Ye shall call to me, My father; and ye shall rot turn back from after me.
{3:20} Surely a wife acting faithlessly by her friend, so ye acted faithlessly against me, O house of Israel, says Jehovah.
{3:21} A voice was heard upon the naked hills, weepings, supplications of the sons of Israel: for they perverted their way, they forgot Jehovah their God.
{3:22} Turn back, ye sons turning away; I will heal your turnings away. Behold, we came to thee; for thou Jehovah our God.
{3:23} Truly in vain from the hills; the multitude of mountains; truly in Jehovah our God the salvation of Israel.
{3:24} And shame consumed the labor of our fathers from our youth; their sheep and their herd, their sons and their daughters.
{3:25} We shall lie down in our shame, and our reproach will cover us: for we sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and we heard not to the voice of Jehovah our God.
{4:1} If thou wilt turn back, O Israel, says Jehovah; thou shalt turn back to me: and if thou wilt remove thine abominations from my face thou shalt not be moved.
{4:2} And thou swearest, Jehovah lives in truth, in judgment, and in justice; and the nations were blessed in him, and in him shall they praise.
{4:3} For thus said Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up to you the fallow ground, and ye shall not sow to thorns.
{4:4} Be circumcised to Jehovah, and remove the uncircumcision of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath shall come forth as fire, and burn, and none quenching it from the face of the evil of your doings.
{4:5} Announce ye in Judah, and cause to be heard in Jerusalem; and say, Strike the trumpet in the land: call, fill up, and say, Be ye gathered together and we will go to the fortified cities.
{4:6} Lift up the signal of Zion: save ye by flight, ye shall not stand: for I bring evil from the north, and a great breaking.
{4:7} The lion came up from his thicket, and destroying, he broke up the nations; he went forth from his place to set thy land for a desolation; thy cities shall be laid waste from none inhabiting.
{4:8} For this, be ye girded with sackcloth, lament and wail: for the heat of the anger of Jehovah turned not back from us.
{4:9} And it was in that day, says Jehovah, the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the chiefs; and the priests were astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.
{4:10} And saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah! surely, deceiving, thou didst deceive to this people and to Jerusalem, saying, Peace shall be to you; and the sword reached even to the soul.
{4:11} In that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A clear wind of the naked hills in the desert the way of the daughter of my people, not for winnowing, and not for separating.
{4:12} A spirit of fulness above these shall come to me: now will I also speak judgments to them.
{4:13} Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots as the whirlwind: his horses were swift above eagles. Wo to us for we were laid waste.
{4:14} O Jerusalem, wash from evil to thy heart so that thou shalt be saved. How long shall purposes of thy vanity lodge in the midst of thee?
{4:15} For a voice announcing from Dan, and causing calamity to be heard from mount Ephraim.
{4:16} Bring ye to remembrance to the nations; behold, cause to be heard against Jerusalem, watchers coming from a land afar off, and they shall give their voice against the cities of Judah.
{4:17} As watching a field they were against her from round about; for she embittered against me, says Jehovah.
{4:18} Thy way and thy doings did these things to thee; this thine evil, for it was bitter because it reached even to thy heart.
{4:19} My bowels, my bowels! I shall afflict the walls of my heart; my heart made commotion to me; I shall not be silent, for the voice of the trumpet thou didst hear, O my soul, the tumult of war.
{4:20} Breaking upon breaking was called; for all the land was laid waste: suddenly were my tents laid waste, my curtains in a moment.
{4:21} How long shall I see the signal, shall I hear the voice of the trumpet?
{4:22} For my people are foolish, they knew me not; foolish sons are they and they not understanding; wise are they to do evil, and to do good they knew not.
{4:23} I saw the earth, and behold, emptiness and a void; and to the heavens, and no lights.
{4:24} I saw the mountains, and behold them trembling, and all the hills were shaken.
{4:25} I saw, and behold, no man, and all the birds of the heavens fled away.
{4:26} I saw, and behold, Carmel a desert, and all its cities were broken down from the face of Jehovah, from the face of the heat of his anger.
{4:27} For thus said Jehovah, All the earth shall be a desert; and I will not make a completion.
{4:28} For this, shall the earth mourn, and the heavens became dark from above: because I spake, I purposed, I lamented not, and I will not turn back from it.
{4:29} From the voice of the horseman and the throwing of the bowman all the city fled; they went into thickets, and they went up upon rocks: every city was forsaken, and not a man dwelling in them.
{4:30} And thou being laid waste, what wilt thou do? If thou shalt put on scarlet, if thou shalt adorn thee with ornaments of gold, if thou shalt rend thine eyes with paint, in vain shalt thou beautify thyself: the lovers despised thee; they will Seek thy soul.
{4:31} For I heard the voice as of her bringing forth, the anguish as of her bearing her first child; the voice of the daughter of Zion, she will sigh, she will spread forth her hands, Wo now to me for my soul fainted for those slaying.
{5:1} Run ye to and fro in the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in her broad places, if ye shall find a man, if there is he doing judgment, seeking faithfulness; and I will pardon to her.
{5:2} And if Jehovah lives, they will say, for this they will swear to a falsehood.
{5:3} O Jehovah, are not thine eyes upon faithfulness? thou didst smite them, and they were not pained; thou didst consume them, they refused to take instruction: they made their faces firm above the rock; they refused to turn back.
{5:4} And I said, Surely, they are weak; they became foolish: for they knew not the way of Jehovah, the judgment of their God.
{5:5} I will go for myself to the great ones, and I will speak to them; for they knew the way of Jehovah, the judgment of their God: surely they together broke the yoke and tore away the bonds.
{5:6} For this, a lion from the forest struck them, a wolf of the deserts will destroy them, the panther watched over their cities: every one going forth from thence shall be torn in pieces; for their transgressions were multiplied, their turnings away were strong.
{5:7} How shall I forgive to thee for this? thy sons forsook me, and they will swear by not God; and I will satisfy them, and they will commit adultery, and they will crowd themselves together to the house of the harlot.
{5:8} They were horses seducing to fornication: roaming about, they will neigh, a man for the wife of his neighbor.
{5:9} For these shall I not review? says Jehovah; and shalt not my soul be avenged upon a nation such as this?
{5:10} Go ye up upon her walls and destroy; and ye shall not make a completion: remove her twigs, for they are not to Jehovah.
{5:11} For acting faithlessly, the house of Israel and the house of Judah acted faithlessly against me, says Jehovah.
{5:12} They lied against Jehovah, and they will say, Not he; and evil shall not come upon us; and we shall not see the sword and famine:
{5:13} And the prophets shall be for wind, and the word not in them: so shall it be done to them.
{5:14} For this, thus said Jehovah, the God of armies, Because ye spake this word, behold me giving my word in thy mouth for fire, and this people wood, and it consumed them.
{5:15} Behold me bringing upon you a nation from far off, O house of Israel, says Jehovah: it is a nation of strength, it is a nation of old, a nation thou wilt not know its tongue, and thou shalt not hear what it will speak.
{5:16} Its quiver as a grave being opened, all they are strong.
{5:17} And it ate thy harvest and thy bread, that thy sons and thy daughters shall eat: it shall eat thy sheep and thine oxen: it shall eat thy vine and thy fig trees: it shall break down thy fortified cities which thou trustedst in them, with the sword.
{5:18} And also in those days, says Jehovah, I will not make with you a completion.
{5:19} And it was when ye shalt say, For what did Jehovah our God all these things to us? and thou saidst to them, As ye forsook me, and ye will serve a strange god in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land not to you.
{5:20} Announce ye this in the house of Jacob, and cause it to be heard in Judah, saying,
{5:21} Hear now this, O foolish people, and no heart; eyes to them and they will not see; and ears to them, and they will not hear:
{5:22} Will ye not fear me? says Jehovah; or will ye not tremble from my face, who set the sand a bound to the sea a law forever, and it shall not pass over it: and its waves shall toss themselves and shall not prevail; and they were put in commotion and shall not pass over it.
{5:23} And to this people was a heart turning aside and perverse, and they turned aside and departed.
{5:24} And they said not in their heart, Now will we fear Jehovah our God, giving rain, and the early and latter rain in its time: the appointed sevenths of harvest he will watch for us.
{5:25} Your iniquities turned away these things, and your sins withheld the good from you.
{5:26} For evil ones were found among my people: he will look about as the stooping of fowlers; they set snares, they will take men.
{5:27} As a cane full of birds, so their houses full of deceit: for this they were magnified and they will be rich.
{5:28} They became fat, they shone: they passed over words of evil: they judged not judgment, the judgment of the orphan, and they will give success; and the judgment of the needy they judged not.
{5:29} For these things shall I not review? says Jehovah: or shall not my soul be avenged upon a nation such as this?
{5:30} Astonishment and horror was in the land.
{5:31} The prophets prophesied in falsehood, and the priests will spread out with their hands; and my people loved it thus: and what will ye do to its last part.
{6:1} Be strong, ye sons of Benjamin, from the midst of Jerusalem, and in Tekoa strike the trumpet, and lift up a lifting up upon the house of the vineyard, for evil overhung from the north, and great breaking.
{6:2} I likened the daughter of Zion to her becoming and delicate.
{6:3} To her shall come the shepherds and their flocks; they fixed the tents upon her round about; they fed each with his hand.
{6:4} Consecrate ye war against her; arise, and we will go up at noon. Wo to us! for the day turned away, for the shadows of the evening will stretch forth.
{6:5} Arise, and we will go up in the night, and we will destroy her fortresses.
{6:6} For thus said Jehovah of armies, Cut off the wood, and throw up a mound against Jerusalem: this the city to be reviewed; oppression is wholly in her midst.
{6:7} As a pit, letting flow her waters, so she dug up her evil: violence and oppression will be heard in her; upon my face continually disease and smiting.
{6:8} Be admonished, O Jerusalem, lest thy soul shall be alienated from thee; lest I shall set thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.
{6:9} Thus said Jehovah of armies, Gleaning, they shall glean as a vine the remainder of Israel: turn back thy hand as he gathering grapes into wicker baskets.
{6:10} To whom shall I speak and testify, and they will hear? behold, their ear being uncircumcised, and they shall not be able to hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah was to them for a reproach; they will not delight in it.
{6:11} I was filled with the wrath of Jehovah; I was weary holding up; to pour out upon the child in the street and upon the assembly of the young men together; for also the man with the woman shall be taken, the old man with the full of days.
{6:12} And their houses were turned to others, the fields and women together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the earth, says Jehovah.
{6:13} For from their little even to their great, every one plundering, plundered; and from the prophet and even to the priest every one did falsehood.
{6:14} And they will heal the breaking of the daughter of my people by making light, and saying, Peace, peace; and no peace.
{6:15} Were they ashamed when they did abomination? also shaming they will not be ashamed; also they knew not feeling shame; for this they shall fall with those falling: in the time of my reviewing them they shall faint, said Jehovah.
{6:16} Thus said Jehovah, Stand ye upon the ways, and see, and ask for the beaten paths of old, where this the good way, and go ye in it, and find rest to your soul. And they will say, We will not go.
{6:17} And I set up watchers over you, Attend ye to the voice of the trumpet And they will say, We will not attend.
{6:18} For this, hear ye nations, and know, O Assembly, what is among them.
{6:19} Hear, thou earth: Behold me bringing evil to this people, the fruit of their purposes, for to my word they hearkened not, and my law they will reject it.
{6:20} Wherefore this to me shall frankincense come from Sheba, and the good cane from a land from far off? your burnt-offerings are not for acceptance, and your sacrifices were not sweet to me.
{6:21} For this, thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving to this people stumbling blocks, and they stumbled upon them, the fathers and sons together; the inhabitant and his neighbor shall perish
{6:22} Thus said Jehovah, Behold, a people coming from the land of the north, and a great nation shall be raised up from the thighs of the earth.
{6:23} They shall lay hold of bow and javelin; it is fierce and they will not pity; their voice will roar as the sea, and they will ride upon horses arranged as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.
{6:24} We heard its report: our hands were relaxed; straits held us, pain as of her bringing forth
{6:25} Thou shalt not go forth to the field, and thou shalt not go by the way; for the sword to the enemy, fear from round about.
{6:26} O daughter of my people, gird on sackcloth, and roll thyself in ashes: make to thee the mourning of an only begotten, a wailing of bitterness; for he laying waste shall suddenly come upon us.
{6:27} I gave thee a watch-tower among my people, a fortification, and thou shalt know and try their way.
{6:28} They are all turning aside, degenerate shoots, going about tale-bearing: brass and iron, they are destroyers all of them.
{6:29} The bellows were burnt from their fire, the founder melted the lead in vain, and the evil were not plucked up.
{6:30} They called to them, Rejected silver, because Jehovah rejected them.
{7:1} The word that was to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
{7:2} Stand in the gate of the house of Jehovah, and call there this word, and say, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah coming into these gates to worship to Jehovah.
{7:3} Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Make good your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
{7:4} Ye shall not trust to yourselves to words of falsehood, saving, The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah are they.
{7:5} For if making good, ye shall make good your ways and your doings; if doing, ye shall do judgment between man and between his neighbor;
{7:6} Ye shall not oppress the stranger, the orphan and the widow, and innocent blood ye shall not pour out in this place, and after other gods ye shall not go, for evil to you;
{7:7} And I caused you to dwell in this place, in the land which I gave to your fathers from forever even to forever.
{7:8} Behold, you trusting to yourselves upon words of falsehood not to receive profit.
{7:9} Stealing, killing, and committing adultery, and swearing for falsehood, and burning incense to Baal, and going after other gods which ye knew not;
{7:10} And ye came and stood before me in this house which my name was called upon it, and ye said, We were delivered to do all these abominations.
{7:11} Was this house which my name was called upon it a cave of those breaking down in your eyes? also I, behold, I saw, says Jehovah.
{7:12} But go now to my place which is in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell there at the first, and see what I did to it from the face of the evil of my people Israel.
{7:13} And now, because ye did all these works, says Jehovah, and I will speak to you, rising early and speaking, and ye heard not; and I will call you and ye answered not;
{7:14} And I did to the house which my name was called upon it, which ye are trusting in it, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.
{7:15} And I cast you out from my face, as I cast out all your brethren, all the seed of Ephraim.
{7:16} And thou shalt not pray for this people, and thou shalt not lift up a wailing and prayer for them, and thou shalt not entreat upon me: for I hear thee not.
{7:17} Seest thou not what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
{7:18} The sons are gathering up woods, and the fathers kindling the fire, and the women knead the dough to make cakes for the queen of the heavens, and to pour out libations to other gods, to irritate me.
{7:19} Are they irritating me? says Jehovah. Are they not themselves to the shame of their faces?
{7:20} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah; Behold my anger and my wrath was poured out to this place, upon man, and upon cattle, and upon the tree of the field, and upon the fruit of the land; and it burnt and it shall not be quenched.
{7:21} Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel; Add your burnt-offerings upon your sacrifices and eat flesh.
{7:22} For I spake not to your fathers, and I commanded them not in the day of bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt, concerning my word of burnt-offering and sacrifice:
{7:23} But this word I commanded them, saying, Hear to my voice, and I was to you for God, and in shall be to me for a people: and go in all the ways which I shall command you, so that it shall be well to you.
{7:24} And they heard not and inclined not their ear, and they went in the counsels in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and they shall be for behind and not before.
{7:25} From the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt even to this day, and I will send to you all my servants the prophets, in the day rising early and sending:
{7:26} And they heard not to me and they inclined not their ear, and they will harden their neck: they did evil above their fathers.
{7:27} And speak thou to them all these words, and they will not hear to thee: and call to them, and they will not answer.
{7:28} And say to them, This a nation that heard not to the voice of Jehovah its God, and they received not instruction: faithfulness perished, and was eat off from their mouth.
{7:29} Shave thy consecration and cast away, and lift up a lamentation upon the lips; for Jehovah rejected and cast out the generation of his wrath.
{7:30} For the sons of Judah did evil in mine eyes, says Jehovah; they set, their abominations in the house which my name was called upon it, to defile it,
{7:31} And they built heights to Tophet which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in fire; which I commanded not, and it came not upon my heart.
{7:32} For this, behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and it shall no more be said, Tophet, and The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter: and they buried in Tophet, from not being place.
{7:33} And the carcass of this people was for food to the birds of the heavens and for the cattle of the earth; and none terrifying.
{7:34} And I caused to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be for a desolation.
{8:1} In that time, says Jehovah, and they shall bring forth the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his chiefs, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:
{8:2} And they spread them to the sun and to the moon, and to all the army of the heavens which they loved, and which they served, and which they, went after, and which they sought and which they worshiped to them: they shall not be gathered and they shall not be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.
{8:3} And death was chosen above life to all the remnant of those being left from this evil family, in all the places being left where I cast them out there, says Jehovah of armies.
{8:4} And say to them, Thus said Jehovah, Shall they fall and not rise? if he shall turn back, and not turn back?
{8:5} Wherefore did this people of Jerusalem turn away a continual turning away? they laid hold upon deceit; they refused to turn back.
{8:6} I hearkened and I will hear, they shall not speak thus: no man lamented for his evil, saying, What did I? Every one turned back in his race as the horse rushing into battle.
{8:7} Also the stork in the heavens knew her appointment; and the turtle-dove, and the swallow, and the twitterer watched the time of their coming; and my people knew not the judgment of Jehovah.
{8:8} How shall ye say, We are wise, and the law of Jehovah with us? Behold, surely for falsehood he made the style of the scribes a lie.
{8:9} The wise were ashamed, they were confounded, and they will be taken: behold, they rejected in the word of Jehovah; and what wisdom to them?
{8:10} For this I will give their wives to others; their fields to those inheriting them: for from small and even to great all plundering a plunder, from the prophet and even to the priest, all did falsehood.
{8:11} And they will heal the breaking of the daughter of my people by making light of, saying, Peace, peace; and no peace.
{8:12} Were they ashamed when they did abomination? also shaming they will not be ashamed, and they knew not to feel shame: for this they shall fall among the falling: in the time of their reviewing they shall faint, said Jehovah.
{8:13} Destroying, I will destroy them, says Jehovah; no grapes upon the vine, and no figs upon the fig tree, and the leaf fell away; and what I shall give to them shall pass by them.
{8:14} For what are we sitting? gather ye together and we will go into the fortified cities, and we shall be silent there: for Jehovah our God caused us to cease, and he will give us to drink the water of poison, for we sinned against Jehovah.
{8:15} Hoping for peace, and no good; for a time of healing, and behold, terror.
{8:16} From Dan was heard the snorting of his horses; from the voice of the neighings of his strong ones all the land trembled: and they will come and cut up the land, and its fulness; the city and those dwelling in it.
{8:17} For behold me sending serpents, vipers among you, which to them no hissing, and they bit you, says Jehovah.
{8:18} Because I afflicted not sorrow upon myself, my heart was sick upon me.
{8:19} Behold the voice of the cry for help of the daughter of my people from the land of those being far off: is not Jehovah in Zion? or her king not in her? wherefore did they irritate me with their carved images, with strange vanities?
{8:20} The harvest passed by, the summer was completed, and we were not saved.
{8:21} For the breaking of the daughter of my people was I broken; I was darkened; astonishment took hold of me.
{8:22} Is there no balsam in Gilead, or healing there? for wherefore did not the health of the daughter of my people go up?
{9:1} Who will give my head waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears? and I will weep day and night for the wounded of the daughter of my people.
{9:2} Who will give me in the desert a lodging-place of travelers? and I will leave my people and go from them, for they all commit adultery; an assembly of those acting faithlessly.
{9:3} And they will bend their tongue, their bow, a lie: and they were not strong for faithfulness upon the land; for from evil to evil they went forth, and they knew me not, says Jehovah.
{9:4} Watch ye each from his neighbor, and to any brother ye shall not trust, for every brother deceiving, will deceive, and every neighbor will go tale-bearing.
{9:5} And they will mock, a man upon his neighbor, and they will not speak the truth: they taught their tongue to speak falsehood, they wearied themselves to sin.
{9:6} Thy dwelling is in the midst of deceit; by deceit they refused to know me, says Jehovah.
{9:7} For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, Behold me melting them, and I tried them; for how shall I do for the face of the daughter of my people?
{9:8} Their tongue a deadly arrow, speaking deceit; in his mouth he will speak peace to his neighbor, and be will lay his wait in his midst.
{9:9} For these things, shall I not review upon them? says Jehovah; or shall not my soul be avenged upon a nation such as this?
{9:10} For the mountains I will lift up weeping and lamentation, and for the seats of the desert, a song of mourning, for they were burnt, from not a man passing through; and they heard not the voice of cattle: from the bird of the heavens and even to the cattle, they fled away, they departed.
{9:11} And I gave Jerusalem for heaps and a dwelling of jackals; and the cities of Judah I will give a desolation from none inhabiting.
{9:12} Who the wise man and he will understand this? and which the mouth of Jehovah spake to him, and he will announce it, for what the land perished it was burnt as the desert, from not being passed through.
{9:13} And Jehovah will say, For their forsaking my law which I gave before their face, and they heard not to my voice, and they went not in it.
{9:14} And they went after the stubbornness of their heart, and after the Baalims which their fathers taught them.
{9:15} For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel: Behold me causing this people to eat wormwood, and I gave them to drink water of poison.
{9:16} And I scattered them in the nations which they knew not, they and their fathers: and I sent after them the sword till I consumed them.
{9:17} Thus said Jehovah of armies, Give heed, and call ye for the wailing women, and they shall come forth; and send ye to the wise women, and they shall come forth.
{9:18} And they shall hasten and lift up a lamentation for us, and our eyes shall go down with tears, and our eyelashes shall shake out waters.
{9:19} For a voice of lamentation was heard from Zion: How were we laid waste! we were greatly ashamed, for we forsook the land, and cast away our dwellings.
{9:20} For hear, ye women, the word of Jehovah, and your ear shall receive the word of his mouth, and teach ye your daughters lamentation, and a woman her neighbor, the song of mourning.
{9:21} For death came up into our windows, it came into our palaces to cut off the child from without, the young men from the streets.
{9:22} Speak: Thus says Jehovah, The carcasses of men fell as dung upon the face of the field, as the handful after the reaper, and none gathering.
{9:23} Thus said Jehovah, The wise shall not boast in his wisdom, and the strong shall not boast in his strength; the rich shall not boast in his riches:
{9:24} But he boasting shall boast in this, to understand and know me, that I am Jehovah, doing mercy, judgment and justice in the earth: for in these I delighted, says Jehovah.
{9:25} Behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I reviewed over all the circumcised with the uncircumcised;
{9:26} Over Egypt and over Judah and over Edom, and over the sons of Ammon, and over Moab, and over all cut off of the extremity dwelling in the desert: for all the nations being uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel uncircumcised of heart.
{10:1} Hear ye the word which Jehovah spake to you, O house of Israel:
{10:2} Thus said Jehovah, Ye shall not learn according to the way of the nations, and from the signs of the heavens ye shall not be terrified; for the nations will be terrified from them.
{10:3} For the laws of the peoples, this vanity: for they cut down a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.
{10:4} With gold and with silver they will beautify; with nails and with hammers they will make firm and it will not move.
{10:5} They are of turned work, as the palm tree, and they shall not speak; being lifted up they shall be lifted up, for they shall not mount up. Ye shall not be afraid of them, for they will not do evil, and also doing good is not with them.
{10:6} For none like thee, O Jehovah; thou art great, and great thy name in strength.
{10:7} Who shall not fear thee, thou king of the nations? for to thee he shall come: for among all the wise of the nations, and among all their kings, from none like thee.
{10:8} And in one they will become brutish, and they will be foolish: the tree itself a correction of vanities.
{10:9} Silver beaten out shall be brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and the hands of the founder: cerulean purple and red purple their clothing: they all are the work of the wise.
{10:10} And Jehovah the God of truth; he the living God, and king eternal: from his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not prevail over his anger.
{10:11} Thus shall ye say to them, The gods who made not the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.
{10:12} He made the earth in his power, setting upright the habitable globe by his wisdom, and by his understanding he stretched out the heavens.
{10:13} At the voice his giving a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he will bring the lifting up from the end of the earth; he made lightnings to the rain, and he will bring forth the wind from his treasures.
{10:14} Every man was brutish from knowledge: every founder was ashamed from his carved image; for his molten image a falsehood, and no spirit in them.
{10:15} They are vanity, the work of delusions: in the time of their reviewing they shall perish.
{10:16} The portion of Jacob not as these: for he forming all things, and Israel the rod of his inheritance: Jehovah of armies his name.
{10:17} Gather the bundles out of the land, thou dwelling in the fortress.
{10:18} For thus said Jehovah: Behold me slinging out those inhabiting the land at this once, and I pressed upon them so that they shall find.
{10:19} Wo to me for my breaking! my blow was sickly; and I said, Surely this a sickness, and I will bear it.
{10:20} My tent was laid waste, and all my cords were broken: my sons went forth from me, and they are not: none stretched forth my tent any more, and the place of my curtains.
{10:21} For the shepherds were brutish, and they sought not Jehovah: for this they considered not, and all their flock was scattered.
{10:22} Behold, a voice of tidings coming, and a great shaking from the land of the north, to set the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling of jackals.
{10:23} I knew, O Jehovah, that not to man his way; not to man to go and set right his step.
{10:24} Correct me, O Jehovah, but in judgment, not in thy wrath, lest thou shalt make me small.
{10:25} Pour out thy wrath upon the nations which knew thee not, and upon the families that called not upon thy name: for they ate up Jacob and consumed him, and they will finish him, and they made desolate his dwelling.
{11:1} The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
{11:2} Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
{11:3} And say to them, Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel: Cursed the man who will not hear the words of this covenant,
{11:4} Which I commanded your fathers in the day of my bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the furnace of iron, saying, Hear ye to my voice, and do them according to all that I shall command you: and be to me for a people, and I will be to you for God:
{11:5} To establish the oath which I sware to your fathers, to give to them a land flowing milk and honey, as this day. And I shall answer and say, Verily, O Jehovah.
{11:6} And Jehovah will say to me, Call all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.
{11:7} For testifying, I testified to your fathers in the day of my bringing them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and testifying, saying, Hear ye to my voice.
{11:8} And they heard not, and inclined not their ear, and they went a man in the stubbornness of their evil heart: and I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant which I commanded to do; and they did not.
{11:9} And Jehovah will say to me, A conspiracy was found in the men of Judah, and in the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
{11:10} They turned back to the iniquities of their fathers before them who refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah brake my covenant which I cut out with their fathers.
{11:11} For this, thus said Jehovah, Behold me bringing evil to them which they shall not be able to go forth from it; and they cried to me and I will not hear to them.
{11:12} And the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem went and cried to the gods which they burnt incense to them: and saving, they will not save to them in the time of their evil.
{11:13} For from the numbering of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and from the numbering of the streets of Jerusalem, ye set up altars to shame, altars to burn incense to Baal.
{11:14} And thou shalt not pray for this people, and thou shalt not lift up for them an outcry and a prayer: for I hear not in the time of their calling to me for their evil.
{11:15} What is to my beloved in my house making mischief to many, and they shall cause the holy flesh to pass away from thee? for thou didst evil, then wilt thou exult.
{11:16} A green olive tree, fair, of fruit of figure, Jehovah called thy name; by the voice of a great noise he kindled a fire upon her, and its branches were evil.
{11:17} And Jehovah of armies planting thee, spake evil against thee, on account of the evil of the house of Israel and the house of Judah which they did to themselves to irritate me, burning incense to Baal.
{11:18} And Jehovah made known to me and I shall know: then thou caused me to see their doings.
{11:19} And I as a gentle lamb being brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that against me they purposed purposes: We will destroy the tree with its food, and we will cut him off from the land of the living, and his name shall no more be remembered.
{11:20} O Jehovah of armies, judging justice and trying the reins and the heart, I shall see thy vengeance from them, for to thee I uncovered my cause.
{11:21} For this, thus said Jehovah, concerning the men of Anathoth seeking my soul, saying, Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, and thou shalt not die by our hand.
{11:22} For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, Behold me reviewing over them: their young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:
{11:23} And a remnant shall not be to them: for I will bring evil to the men of Anathoth, the year of their reviewing.
{12:1} Just art thou, O Jehovah, for I will strive to thee: surely I will speak judgments with thee: Wherefore did the way of the evil prosper? all they acting faithlessly with treachery were secure?
{12:2} Thou didst plant them; they took root; they went on, also they made fruit: thou being near in their mouth, and far off from their reins.
{12:3} And thou, Jehovah, knew me: thou wilt see me, and thou didst try my heart with thee: pluck them out as sheep for the slaughter, and consecrate them to the day of slaughter.
{12:4} How long shall the land mourn, and the herbage of every field dry up from the evil of those dwelling in it the earth perished, and the birds; for they said, He shall not see our last Part.
{12:5} If thou didst run with the footmen and they will weary thee, and how wilt thou contend with horses? and in the land of peace thou trustest, and how wilt thou do in the grandeur of Jordan.
{12:6} For also thy brethren and the house of thy father, they also acted faithlessly with thee; they also called after thee a fulness: thou shalt not believe in them for they will speak to thee good things.
{12:7} I forsook my house, I rejected mine inheritance; I gave the beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
{12:8} My inheritance was to me as a lion in the forest; she gave upon me with her voice: for this I hated her.
{12:9} The ravenous hyena is my inheritance to me, rushing round about upon her; go ye, gather together all the beasts of the field, set ye upon to eat her.
{12:10} Many shepherds destroyed my vineyard, they trod down my portion, they gave the portion of my desire for a desert of desolation.
{12:11} Setting her for a desolation, she mourned to me; all the land was set a desolation, for no man put upon his heart.
{12:12} They spoiling came upon all the hills of the desert: for the sword of Jehovah consumed from the extremity of the land even to extremity of the land: no peace to all flesh.
{12:13} They sowed wheat and they reaped thorns: they were wearied, they shall not profit; and they were ashamed of your gains from the burning of the anger of Jehovah.
{12:14} Thus said Jehovah concerning all my evil neighbors, those touching upon the inheritance which I caused my people Israel to inherit: behold me tearing them up from their land, and I will tear up the house of Judah from the midst of them.
{12:15} And it was after my tearing them up I will turn back and compassionate them, and cause them to dwell a man to his inheritance, and a man to his land.
{12:16} And it was if learning, they shall learn the ways of my people to swear in my name, Jehovah lives; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; and they were built up in the midst of my people.
{12:17} And if they will not hear, tearing up and destroying, I tore up that nation, says Jehovah.
{13:1} Thus said Jehovah to me, Go buy for thee a girdle of linen, and put it upon thy loins, and thou shalt not cause it to come into water.
{13:2} And I shall buy the girdle according to the word of Jehovah, and I shall put upon my loins.
{13:3} And the word of Jehovah will be to me the second time, saying,
{13:4} Take the girdle that thou boughtest, which is upon thy loins, and arising, go to Euphrates and hide it there in the cleft of the rock.
{13:5} And I shall go and hide it by Euphrates as Jehovah commanded me.
{13:6} And it will be from the end of many days, and Jehovah will say to me, Rising, go to Euphrates, and take from thence the girdle which I commanded thee to hide it there.
{13:7} And I shall go to Euphrates, and dig, and take the girdle from the place which I hid it there: and behold, the girdle was corrupted, it will not profit for anything.
{13:8} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{13:9} Thus said Jehovah, According to this I will corrupt the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
{13:10} This evil people, refusing to hear my words, going in the stubbornness of their heart, and they will go after other gods to serve them and to worship to them, and it shall be as this girdle which shall not profit for anything.
{13:11} For as the girdle will adhere to the loins of a man, so did I cause to adhere to me all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah, says Jehovah: to be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for glory: and they heard not.
{13:12} And say to them this word: Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Every flask shall be filled with wine: and they said to thee, Knowing, shall it not be known that every flask shall be filled with wine?
{13:13} And say to them, Thus said Jehovah, Behold me filling all inhabiting this land, and all the kings sitting to David upon his throne, and the priests and the prophets, and all inhabiting Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
{13:14} And I dashed them in pieces, a man against his brother, and the fathers and the sons together, says Jehovah. I will not pity, and I will not spare, and I will not compassionate from destroying them.
{13:15} Hear ye, and give ear; ye shall not be proud: for Jehovah spake.
{13:16} Ye shall give glory to Jehovah your God, before he shall darken, and before your feet shall strike upon the mountains of darkness, and ye waited for light, and he set it for the shadow of death, he will place for gloom.
{13:17} And if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in hiding places from the face of pride, and mine eye weeping shall weep and bring down tears, because the flock of Jehovah was taken captive.
{13:18} Say to the king and to the mistress, Humble yourselves, sit down: for the crown of your glory was brought down from your heads.
{13:19} The cities of the south were shut up and none opened: Judah was carried away captive, it was all carried away captive, the whole of them.
{13:20} Lift up your eyes and see them coming from the north: where the flock given to thee, the sheep of thy glory?
{13:21} What wilt thou say when he shall review upon thee? and thou didst teach them the chiefs for head over thee: shall not pains lay hold of thee as a woman bringing forth?
{13:22} And if thou shalt say in thy heart, Wherefore did these things befall me? for the multitude of thine iniquities thy skirts were uncovered, thy heel treated with violence.
{13:23} Will the Cushite change his skin and the panther his variegated spots? Ye shall also be able to do good, being taught to do evil.
{13:24} And I will scatter them as the straw passing away by the wind of the desert.
{13:25} This thy lot and the portion of thy measure from me, says Jehovah; because thou didst forget me and thou wilt trust in falsehood.
{13:26} And also I uncovered thy skirts upon thy face and thy dishonor was seen.
{13:27} Thine adulteries and thy neighings, the purpose of thy harlotry upon the hills, in the field, I saw thine abominations. Wo to thee, O Jerusalem thou wilt not be cleansed after me; how long yet?
{14:1} The word of Jehovah which was to Jeremiah concerning the words of the drought.
{14:2} Judah mourned and her gates languished; they were darkened to the earth, and the outcry of Jerusalem went up.
{14:3} And their great ones sent their small ones to the waters; they came to the wells, they found no water; they turned back their vessels empty; they were ashamed and disgraced, and they covered their head.
{14:4} For the land was broken, for there was no rain in the land; the husbandmen were ashamed, they covered their head.
{14:5} For also the hind brought forth in the field, and forsook, for there was no grass.
{14:6} And the wild asses stood upon the naked hills, they panted after the wind as the jackals; their eyes failed because no grass.
{14:7} If our iniquities answered against us, O Jehovah, do for sake of thy name: for our turnings back were many; we sinned against thee.
{14:8} The hope of Israel, saving him in time of straits, wherefore wilt thou be as a sojourner in the earth, and as a traveler turning aside to lodge?
{14:9} Wherefore shalt thou be as a man struck dumb? as a strong one he shall not be able to save? and thou in the midst of us, O Jehovah, and thy name was called upon us; thou wilt not leave us.
{14:10} Thus said Jehovah to this people, Thus they loved to wander, they restrained not their feet, and Jehovah accepted them not; now will he remember their iniquity and he will review their sin.
{14:11} And Jehovah will say to me, Thou shalt not pray for this people for good.
{14:12} When they shall fast I hear not their outcry; and when they shall bring up a burnt-offering and gift, I accept them not; for with the sword and by famine and by death I consume them.
{14:13} And saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, the prophets saying to them, Ye shall not see the sword, and famine shall not be to you; for the peace of truth will I give to you in this place.
{14:14} And Jehovah will say to me, The prophets are prophesying a lie in my name: I sent them not, and I commanded them not, and I spake not to them: a vision of falsehood and a divination, and nought, and the deceit of their heart they are prophesying to you.
{14:15} For this, thus said Jehovah concerning the prophets prophesying in my name, and I sent them not, and they saying, The sword and famine shall not be in this land; by the sword and by famine shall these prophets die.
{14:16} And the people which they are prophesying to them shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, from the face of the famine and the sword; and none to them burying them, their wives and their sons and their daughters; and I poured their evil upon them.
{14:17} And say to them this word: Mine eyes shall bring down tears night and day, and they shall not rest: for the virgin daughter of my people was broken with a great breaking, a very sickly wound.
{14:18} If I shall go forth into the field, and behold, the wounded of the sword and if I came into the city, and behold, they shall be sick with famine for also the prophet, also the priest went about to a land they knew not.
{14:19} Rejecting, didst thou reject Judah? if thy soul abhorred in Zion? wherefore didst thou smite us, and no healing to us? waiting for peace, and no good; and for a time of healing, and behold terror.
{14:20} We knew, O Jehovah, our evil, the iniquity of our fathers: for we sinned to thee.
{14:21} Thou wilt not despise us; for sake of thy name, thou wilt not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, thou wilt not break thy covenant with us.
{14:22} Is there among the vanities of the nations those causing ruin? and if the heavens will give showers? Art not thou he, Jehovah our God? And we will wait for thee: for thou didst make all these.
{15:1} And Jehovah will say to me, If Moses shall stand, and Samuel, before my face, my soul not to this people: casting from my face they shall go forth.
{15:2} And it was if they shall say to thee, Whither shall we go forth? And say to them, Thus said Jehovah, Whom for death to death; and whom for the sword to the sword; and whom for famine to famine; and whom for captivity to captivity.
{15:3} And I reviewed over them four kinds, says Jehovah: the sword to kill, and dogs to tear in pieces, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the earth, to consume and destroy.
{15:4} And I gave them for maltreatment to all the kingdoms because of Manasseh, son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.
{15:5} For who shall have compassion upon thee, O Jerusalem? and who shall bewail for thee? and who shall turn aside to ask for thy peace?
{15:6} Thou didst reject me, says Jehovah; thou wilt go backward; and I will stretch forth my hand against thee, and I will destroy thee; I was weary of lamenting.
{15:7} And I will scatter them with a scattering in the gates of the land; I bereaved of offspring, I destroyed my people; they turned not back from their ways.
{15:8} Their widows were many to me above the sand of the seas: I brought to them against the mother a young man laying waste at noon: I caused to fall upon her suddenly wrath and terror.
{15:9} She bringing forth seven, languished: she breathed out her soul; her sun went down in the midst of the day: she was ashamed and blushed: and their remainder I will give to the sword before their enemies, says Jehovah.
{15:10} Wo to me, my mother, for thou broughtest me forth a man of strife and a man of contention to all the earth. I lent not on interest and they lent not to me on interest: they are altogether cursing me.
{15:11} Jehovah said, If to do well to thy remnant; if not, I caused the enemy in the time of evil and in time of straits to supplicate to thee.
{15:12} Shall iron break the iron of the north, and brass?
{15:13} Thy strength and thy treasures I will give for a spoil not for price, and in all thy sins and in all thy bounds.
{15:14} And I caused to pass with thine enemies into a land thou knewest not: for a fire was kindled in my wrath; it shall burn upon you.
{15:15} Thou knewest, O Jehovah: remember me, and review me, and avenge for me from him pursuing me; not for being slow of thy wrath wilt thou take me away; know, I suffered reproach for thee.
{15:16} Thy words were found, and eating them; and thy word will be to me for the gladness and for the joy of my heart: for thy name was called upon me, Jehovah the God of armies.
{15:17} I sat not in the assembly of those mocking, and I will not exult; from the face of thy hand I sat alone, for thou didst fill me with anger.
{15:18} Wherefore was my pain everlasting and my blow incurable, refusing to be healed? Being, wilt thou be to me as falsehood, the waters were not faithful?
{15:19} For this, thus said Jehovah, If thou wilt turn back, and I will turn thee back, thou shalt stand before me: and if thou shalt bring forth the precious from the vile thou shalt be as my mouth: they shall turn back to thee and thou shalt not turn back to them.
{15:20} And I gave thee to this people for a wall of brass, fortified: and they shall war against thee, and they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, says Jehovah.
{15:21} And I delivered thee out of the hand of the evil, and I redeemed thee from the hand of the terrible.
{16:1} And the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
{16:2} Thou shalt not take to thee a wife, and sons and daughters shall not be to thee in this place.
{16:3} For thus said Jehovah concerning the sons, and concerning the daughters born in this place, and concerning their mothers bearing them, and concerning their fathers begetting them in this land:
{16:4} Deaths of diseases shall they die; they shall not be lamented, and they shall not be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth, and by sword and by famine shall they be consumed, and their carcass was for food to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the earth.
{16:5} For thus said Jehovah, Thou shalt not go in to the house of wailing, and thou shalt not go to lament and thou shalt not deplore for them, for I took away my peace from this people, says Jehovah; kindness and mercies.
{16:6} And the great and small died in this land: they shall not be buried, and they shall not lament for them, and none shall cut himself or make bald for them:
{16:7} They shall not break bread in mourning to comfort him for the dead; and they shall not give them to drink the cup of consolations for his father and for his mother.
{16:8} And to the house of drinking thou shalt not go in to sit with them to eat and to drink.
{16:9} For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel: Behold me causing to cease from this place to your eyes and in your days the voice of gladness and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
{16:10} And being when thou shalt announce to this people all these words, and they said to thee, For what did Jehovah speak against us all this great evil? and what our iniquities? and what our sins which we sinned to Jehovah our God?
{16:11} And say to them, Because your fathers forsook me, says Jehovah, and went after other gods, and they will serve them and worship to them, and they forsook me, and my law they watched not;
{16:12} And ye acted wickedly to do more than your fathers; and behold, you going a man after the stubbornness of his evil heart for not hearing to me.
{16:13} And I cast you out from this land upon the land which ye knew not, ye and your fathers; and ye served there other gods day and night, where I will not give to you mercy.
{16:14} For this, behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and it shall no more be said, Jehovah lives who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
{16:15} But Jehovah lives who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands where he thrust them away there: and I turned them back upon their land which I gave to their fathers.
{16:16} Behold me sending for many fishers, says Jehovah, and they fished them; and after this I will send for many hunters, and they hunted them from every mountain, and from every hill, and from the clefts of the rocks.
{16:17} For mine eyes are upon all their ways, and they were not hid from my face, and their iniquity was not concealed from before mine eyes.
{16:18} And I requited first double their iniquity and their sin, for their defiling my land, with the carcasses of their abominable things, and their abominations they filled up mine inheritance.
{16:19} O Jehovah, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in days of straits, to thee shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and they shall say, Surely our fathers inherited falsehood, vanity, and no receiving profit in them.
{16:20} Shall man make to himself gods, and they not gods?
{16:21} For this, behold me causing them to know in this once, I will cause them to know my hand and my strength; and they shall know that my name is Jehovah.
{17:1} The sin of Judah was written with a style of iron, with the nail of diamond: being graved upon the table of their heart, and to the horns of your altars.
{17:2} For their sons remember their altars and their images by the green tree upon the high hills.
{17:3} O my mountain in the field, thy strength, all thy treasures I will, give for plunder, thy heights for sin in all thy bounds.
{17:4} And thou wert thrust in thyself from thine inheritance which I gave to thee; and I caused thee to serve thine enemies in a land which thou knewest not: for ye kindled a fire in mine anger; it shall burn forever.
{17:5} Thus said Jehovah: Cursed the man who shall trust in man, and set flesh his arm, and shall turn away his heart from Jehovah.
{17:6} And he was as ruins in the sterile region, and he shall not see when good shall come; he inherited the arid places in the desert, a salt land, and it shall not be inhabited.
{17:7} Blessed the man who shall trust in Jehovah, and his trust was Jehovah.
{17:8} And he was as a tree planted by the waters, and it shall spread out its roots by the river, and it shall not see when heat shall come, and its leaf was green; and it shall not be afraid in the year of restraint, and it shall not withdraw from making fruit.
{17:9} The heart is deceitful above all, and man himself, who shall know him?
{17:10} I Jehovah searching the heart, trying the reins, to give to each according to his way, according to the fruit of his doings.
{17:11} The partridge brooded and she brought not forth; to make riches and not in judgment, he shall leave them in the half of his days, and in his latter part he shall be foolish.
{17:12} A throne of glory being lifted up from the first our holy place.
{17:13} The hope of Israel, O Jehovah, all forsaking thee shall be ashamed, turning away from me they shall be written in the earth, for they forsook the fountain of the water of life, Jehovah.
{17:14} Heal me, O Jehovah, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou my praise.
{17:15} Behold them saying to me, Where the word of Jehovah? it shall come now.
{17:16} And I withdrew not from following after thee; I desired not man's day, thou knewest: the going forth of my lips was straight before thee.
{17:17} Thou wilt not be for a terror to me; thou my refuge in the evil day.
{17:18} They pursuing me shall be ashamed, and I shall not be ashamed: they shall be dismayed, and I shall not be dismayed: bring upon them the evil day, and break them with a double breaking.
{17:19} Thus said Jehovah to me: Go and stand in the gate of the sons of the people which the kings of Judah shall come in in it, and which they shall go forth in it, and in all the gates of Jerusalem.
{17:20} And say to them, Hear the word of Jehovah, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all inhabiting Jerusalem, coming in by these gates:
{17:21} Thus said Jehovah: Watch ye in your souls, and ye shall not lift up a lifting up in the day of the Sabbath, and bring in by the gates of Jerusalem.
{17:22} And ye shall not bring forth a burden from your houses in the day of the Sabbath, and all work ye shall not do, and consecrate the day of the Sabbath as I commanded your fathers.
{17:23} And they heard not, and they inclined not their ear, and they will harden their neck not to hear, and not to receive instruction.
{17:24} And it was, if hearing, ye shall hear to me, says Jehovah, not to bring a burden into the gates of this city in day of the Sabbath, and to consecrate the day of the Sabbath, not to do in it any work;
{17:25} And there came into the gates of this city kings and chiefs sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and upon horses, they and their chiefs, men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city was inhabited forever.
{17:26} And they came from the cities of Judah and from round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountain, and from the south, bringing a burnt-offering and sacrifice, and gift, and frankincense, and bringing praise into the house of Jehovah.
{17:27} And if ye will not hear to me to consecrate the day of the Sabbath, not to lift up a burden, and coming into the gates of Jerusalem in the day of the Sabbath; and I kindled a fire in her gates and it consumed the palaces of Jerusalem and it shall not be quenched.
{18:1} The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
{18:2} Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my word.
{18:3} And I shall go down to the potter's house, and behold him doing a work upon the stone.
{18:4} And the vessel which he made was destroyed as clay in the hand of the potter: and he turned back, and he will make another vessel as was right in the eyes of the potter to make.
{18:5} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{18:6} As this potter shall I not be able to do to you, O house of Israel? says Jehovah. Behold, as the clay in the hand of the potter, thus are ye in my hand, O house of Israel.
{18:7} The moment I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to tear down, and to destroy:
{18:8} And that nation which I spake against it turned back from its evil, and I lamented for the evil which I proposed to do to it.
{18:9} And the moment I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant:
{18:10} And it did evil in mine eyes not to hear to my voice, and I lamented for the good which I said to do well to it.
{18:11} And now, say now to the men of Judah, and concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said Jehovah: Behold, I will form evil against you, and purpose a purpose against you; turn ye back now each from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.
{18:12} And they said, We shall despair; for after our purposes we will go, and we will do each the stubbornness of his evil heart.
{18:13} For this, thus said Jehovah: Ask now among the nations, who heard like as these things: the virgin of Israel did very horrible things.
{18:14} Shall the field cut loose from the rock the snow of Lebanon? or shall the cold flowing waters of an inundation be dried up?
{18:15} Because my people forgat me they will burn incense in vain; by their ways they will cause the paths of old to fail, to go beaten paths, a way not cast up;
{18:16} To set their land for a desolation, eternal hissings; every one passing over it shall be astonished and shall shake with his head.
{18:17} As the east wind I will scatter them before the face of the enemy; I will cause them to see the neck and not the face, in the day of their destruction.
{18:18} And they will say, Come, and we will purpose purposes against Jeremiah; for law shall not perish from the priest, and counsel from the wise, and the word from the prophet Come, and we will strike him with the tongue, and we will not attend to any of his words.
{18:19} Attend to me, O Jehovah, and hear for the voice of mine adversary.
{18:20} Shall evil be requited for good? for they dug a pit for my soul. Remember my standing before thee to speak good for them, to turn back thy wrath from them.
{18:21} For this, give their sons to the famine, and pour them out upon the hands of the sword; and their wives shall be bereaved of offspring, and be widows; and their men shall be slain by death; their young men struck of the sword in battle.
{18:22} A cry shall be heard from their houses, for thou shalt bring upon them a trap suddenly, for they dug a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.
{18:23} And thou, O Jehovah, knewest all their counsel against me to kill: thou wilt not expiate for their iniquity, and their sin from before thee thou wilt not wipe away, and they shall be weak before thee; do with them in the time of thine anger.
{19:1} Thus said Jehovah, Go and buy a potter's earthen bottle, and from the old men of the people and from the old men of the priests;
{19:2} And go forth to the valley of the, son of Hinnom, which is at the opening of the gate of the pottery, and call there the words which I shall speak to thee.
{19:3} And say, Hear the word of Jehovah, ye kings of Judah, and ye dwelling in Jerusalem; Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel: Behold me bringing evil upon this place, which every one hearing it, their ears shall tingle.
{19:4} Because they forsook me and rejected this place, and they will burn incense in it to other gods which they knew them not, they and their fathers, and the kings of Judah; and they filled this place with the blood of the innocent ones.
{19:5} And they built the heights of Baal to burn their sons with fire, burnt-offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, and I spake not, and it came not up upon my heart.
{19:6} For this, behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and it shall no more be called to this place Tophet, and The valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of Slaughter.
{19:7} And I emptied out the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I caused them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them seeking their soul: and I gave their carcasses for food to the fowls of the heavens and to the beasts of the earth.
{19:8} And I set this city for a desolation, and for hissing: every one passing over it shall be astonished and shall hiss over all her blows.
{19:9} And I caused them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and each the flesh of his neighbor shall they eat in the straitness and in the distress which their enemies, and they seeking their souls, shall press upon them.
{19:10} And break the bottle before the eyes of the men going with thee,
{19:11} And say to them, Thus said Jehovah of armies: According to this will I break this people and this city, as he will break the potter's vessel which shall not be able to be healed any more: and in Tophet shall they bury, from not a place to bury.
{19:12} Thus will I do to this place, says Jehovah, and to its inhabitants, and to give this city as Tophet:
{19:13} And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah were defiled as the place of Tophet to all the houses which they burnt incense upon their roofs to all the army of the heavens, and pouring out libations to other gods.
{19:14} And Jeremiah will come from Tophet where Jehovah sent him there to prophesy; and he will stand in the enclosure of the house of Jehovah and say to all the people,
{19:15} Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Behold me bringing to this city and upon all her cities all the evil which I spake against her, because they hardened their neck not to hear my word.
{20:1} And Pashur, son of Immer the priest, and he appointed overseer of the house of Jehovah, will hear Jeremiah prophesying these words.
{20:2} And Pashur will strike Jeremiah the prophet and give him upon the stocks which were in the gate of Benjamin the highest, which were in the house of Jehovah.
{20:3} And it will be on the morrow, and Pashur will bring forth Jeremiah from the stocks. And Jeremiah will say to him, Jehovah called not thy name Pashur, but Terror from round about.
{20:4} For thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving thee for terror to thyself and to all loving thee; and they fell by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes seeing: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babel, and he carried them captive to Babel, and be struck them with the sword.
{20:5} And I gave all the strength of this city, and all her labors, and everything precious of hers, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, and they spoiled them, and took them and brought them to Babel.
{20:6} And thou, Pashur, and all dwelling in thy house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babel, and thou shalt die there, and there shalt thou be buried, and all those loving thee to whom thou didst prophesy to them in falsehood.
{20:7} Thou didst persuade me, O Jehovah, and I shall be persuaded: thou didst hold me fast, and thou wilt prevail: I was for a derision all the day, all mocking to me.
{20:8} For as often as I shall speak I shall cry; violence and oppression I shall call; for the word of Jehovah was to me for a reproach and for a derision all the day.
{20:9} And I said, I will not bring him to remembrance, and I will no more speak in his name. And it was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was wearied to endure, and I shall not be able.
{20:10} For I heard the slander of many, terror from round about Announce ye, and we will announce. Every man of my peace watching my halting: perhaps he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail against him, and we will take our vengeance of him.
{20:11} And Jehovah is with me as a strong terrible one: for this, they pursuing shall be weak, and they shall not prevail; they were greatly ashamed, for they prospered not; perpetual shame shall not be forgotten.
{20:12} And Jehovah of armies trying the just, seeing the reins and the heart, I shall see thy vengeance of them: for to thee I uncovered my cause.
{20:13} Sing ye to Jehovah, praise ye Jehovah: for he delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of those doing evil.
{20:14} Cursed the day which I was born in it; the day which my mother brought me forth shall not be blessed.
{20:15} Cursed the man who announced to my father, Good news; saying, A son, a male was born to thee; with rejoicing, making him rejoice.
{20:16} And that man being as the cities which Jehovah overthrew, and lamented not: and hearing the cry in the morning and the loud noise in time of noon.
{20:17} Because he killed me not from the womb, and my mother will be to me my grave, and her womb pregnant forever.
{20:18} Wherefore this came I forth from the womb to see labor and sorrow, and my days shall be finished with shame?
{21:1} The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah in king Zedekiah's sending to him Pashur son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah son Maaseiah the priest, saying,
{21:2} Seek now: Jehovah for us; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel is warring against us; perhaps Jehovah will do with us his wonders, and he shall go up from us.
{21:3} And Jeremiah will say to them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:
{21:4} Thus said Jehovah God of Israel: Behold me turning about the weapons of war which are in your hands which ye are fighting with them with the king of Babel, and the Chaldeans, pressing upon you without the wall, and I gathered you to the midst of this city.
{21:5} And I warred with you with a hand stretched out and with an arm of strength, and in anger and in heat and in great wrath.
{21:6} And I struck the inhabitants of this city, and man and beast: in great death they shall die.
{21:7} And after this, says Jehovah, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and those being left in this city, from death, from the sword, and from famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them seeking their soul: and he smote them with the mouth of the sword; he shall not have compassion upon them, and he shall not spare, and he shall not pity.
{21:8} And to this people thou shalt say, Thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving before your face the way of life and the way of death.
{21:9} He dwelling in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by death: and he going forth and falling to the Chaldeans pressing upon you, shall live, and his soul was to him for booty.
{21:10} For I set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, says Jehovah: into the hand of the king of Babel shall it be given, and it was burnt with fire.
{21:11} And for the house of the king of Judah, hear ye the word of Jehovah:
{21:12} O house of David, thus said Jehovah, Judge judgment for the morning, and deliver him taken by force from the hand of him oppressing, lest my wrath shall go forth as fire, and burn, and none quenching from the face of the evil of your doings.
{21:13} Behold me against thee, thou inhabitress of the valley, rock of the plain, says Jehovah; those saying, Who shall come down against us? and who shall come into our habitations?
{21:14} And I reviewed over you according to the fruit of your doings, says Jehovah: and I kindled a fire in her forest, and it consumed all round about her.
{22:1} Thus said Jehovah: Go down to the house of the king of Judah and speak there this word,
{22:2} And say, Hear thou the word of Jehovah, O king of Judah, sitting upon the throne of David, thou and thy servants, and thy people coming in to these gates:
{22:3} Thus said Jehovah, Do ye judgment and justice, and deliver him taken by force, from the hand of him oppressing: ye shall not be violent, ye shall not oppress the stranger, the orphan, and the widow, and ye shall not pour but innocent blood in this place.
{22:4} For if doing, ye shall do this word, and kings came into the gates of this house, sitting to David upon his throne, riding in chariots and upon horses, he send his servants and his people.
{22:5} And if ye will not bear these words, by myself I sware, says Jehovah, that this house shall be for a desolation.
{22:6} For thus said Jehovah, concerning the house of the king of Judah: Thou Gilead to me, the head of Lebanon, if I shall not set thee a desert cities not inhabited.
{22:7} And I consecrated destroyers against thee, a man and his weapons: and they cut off from the chosen of thy cedars and cast upon the fire.
{22:8} And many nations passed through this city, and they said a man to his neighbor, For what did Jehovah thus to this great city?
{22:9} And they said, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah their God, and they will worship to other gods, and serve them.
{22:10} Ye shall not weep for the dead, and ye shall not bewail for him: weep ye, weep ye for him going away, for he shall no more turn back and see the land of his nativity.
{22:11} For thus said Jehovah to Shallum son of Josiah, king of Judah, reigning, instead of Josiah his father, who went forth from this place: He shall no more return there:
{22:12} For in the place where they carried him captive, there he shall die, and shall no more see this land.
{22:13} Wo to him building his house not with justice, and his upper chambers not with judgment; by his neighbor he will work gratuitously, and he will give him not for his work;
{22:14} Saying, I will build to me a house of extension, and airy upper chambers, and he rent to himself windows; and covered with cedar, and painted with red.
{22:15} Shalt thou reign, for thou art kindled with cedar? did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice, then it was well to him?
{22:16} He judged the judgment of the poor and the needy; then it was well: was this not knowing me? says Jehovah.
{22:17} For thine eyes and thy heart not but for thy plunder and for guiltless blood to pour out, and for oppression and for running, to do.
{22:18} For this, thus said Jehovah of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah: They shall not lament for him: Alas, my brother! and, Alas, sister! they shall not lament for him, Alas, lord! and, Alas, the majesty!
{22:19} He shall be buried the burial of an ass, dragged and cast from beyond the gate of Jerusalem.
{22:20} Go up to Lebanon and cry, and in Basilan thou shalt give thy voice and cry from the passages, for all they loving thee were broken.
{22:21} I spake to thee in thy, securities, thou saidst, I will not hear. This thy way from thy youth, for thou heardest not to my voice.
{22:22} The wind shall feed all thy shepherds, and they loving thee shall go into captivity: for then shalt thou be ashamed and disgraced for all thine evil.
{22:23} Thou dwelling in Lebanon, building a nest in the cedars, how being compassionated in pangs coming to thee the pain as of her bringing forth.
{22:24} I live says Jehovah, for if Coniah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, shall be the seal upon my right hand, I will pluck thee off from thence.
{22:25} And I gave thee into the hand of those seeking thy soul, and into the hand of whom thou fearest their face, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
{22:26} And I cast thee and thy mother who bare thee upon another land where ye were not born there, and there shall ye die.
{22:27} And upon the land where they lift up their soul to turn back there, there they shall not turn back.
{22:28} Is this man Coniah a despised broken earthen vessel? or a vessel no delight in it? wherefore they were cast out, he and his seed, and they were cast upon a land which they knew not.
{22:29} O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Jehovah.
{22:30} Thus said Jehovah, Write ye this man destitute, a man shall not prosper in his days: for not a man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling yet in Judah.
{23:1} Wo to the shepherds destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture! says Jehovah.
{23:2} For this, thus said Jehovah God of Israel, against the shepherds feeding my people: Ye scattered my flock and ye will thrust them away, and ye reviewed them not: behold me reviewing over you the evil of your doings, says Jehovah.
{23:3} And I will gather the remnant of my flock from all the lands where I thrust them away there, and I turned them back to their rests, and they were fruitful and multiplied.
{23:4} And I set up shepherds over them, and they fed them; and they shall no more fear, and they shall not be terrified, and they shall not be reviewed, says Jehovah.
{23:5} Behold the days coming, says Jehovah, and I raised up to David a just sprout, and a king reigned and prospered, and he did judgment and justice in the earth.
{23:6} In his days shall Judah be saved, and Israel shall dwell with confidence: and this his name which he shall be called: Jehovah Our Justice.
{23:7} For this, behold the days coming, says Jehovah, and they shall no more say, Jehovah lives, who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
{23:8} But But Jehovah lives who brought up and who caused the seed of the house of Israel to come from the land of the north, and from all the lands where I thrust them away there; and they shall dwell upon their land.
{23:9} For the prophets my heart was broken in the midst of me, and all my bones were relaxed; I was as a man intoxicated, and as a man wine passing over him, from the face of Jehovah, and from the face of the words of his holiness.
{23:10} For the land was filled from adulteries, for from the face of these the land mourned, the beautiful things of the desert were dried up, and their race will be evil, and their strength not right.
{23:11} For also the prophets, also the priests were polluted; also in my house I found their evil, says Jehovah.
{23:12} For this their way shall be to them as slippery places in darkness: they shall be thrust away and they fell in it; for I will bring evil upon them, the year of their reviewing, says Jehovah.
{23:13} And I saw folly in the prophets of Shomeron; they prophesied in Baal, and they will cause my people Israel to wander.
{23:14} And in the prophets of Jerusalem I saw a horrible thing, committing adultery and going in falsehood: and they strengthened the hands of those doing evil, they turned not back a man from his evil: they were to me all of them as Sodom, and those dwelling in her as Gomorrah.
{23:15} For this, thus said Jehovah of armies concerning the prophets, Behold me feeding them with wormwood, and I caused to drink the water of poison: for from the prophets of Jerusalem went forth profaneness to all the earth.
{23:16} Thus said Jehovah of armies, Ye shall not hear to the words of the prophets prophesying to you; they making you vain: they will speak the vision of their heart, not from the mouth of Jehovah.
{23:17} Saying to say to those despising the word of Jehovah, There shall be peace to you; and every one going in the stubbornness of his heart, they said, Evil shall not come to you.
{23:18} For who stood in the consultation of Jehovah, and will see and hear his word who attended to his word and will hear?
{23:19} Behold, the storm of Jehovah went forth with wrath, a piercing storm; it shall be hurled upon the head of the evil ones.
{23:20} The anger of Jehovah shall not turn back till his doing, and till his setting up the purposes of his heart: in the last of the days ye shall understand in it with understanding.
{23:21} I sent not the prophets, and they ran; I spake not to them, and they prophesied.
{23:22} And if they stood in my consultation, and they will cause my people to hear my word, and turn them back from their evil way and from the evil of their doings.
{23:23} Am I God from near, says Jehovah, and not God from far off?
{23:24} If a man shall hide in secret places and I shall not see him, says Jehovah. Do I not fill the heavens and the earth? says Jehovah.
{23:25} I heard what the prophets said, prophesying a falsehood in my name, saying, I dreamed, I dreamed.
{23:26} How long is it in the heart of the prophets prophesying a lie, and prophesying the deceit of their heart?
{23:27} Reckoning to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they will recount a man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgat my name in Baal.
{23:28} The prophet whom with him a dream, he will recount a dream; and whom my word with him, he will speak my word in truth. What to the straw with the grain? says Jehovah.
{23:29} So is not my word as fire? says Jehovah; and as a hammer, it will break the rock in pieces.
{23:30} For this, behold me against the prophets, says Jehovah, stealing my words, a man from his neighbor.
{23:31} Behold me against the prophets, says Jehovah, taking their tongue, and they will mutter an oracle.
{23:32} Behold me against them prophesying dreams of falsehood, says Jehovah, and they will recount them, and will cause my people to wander by their falsehoods and by their boasting; and I sent them not, and I commanded them not; and helping, they shall be of no profit to this people, says Jehovah.
{23:33} And when this people, or prophet, or priest, shall ask thee, saying, What the burden of Jehovah? and thou saidst to them, What burden? And I cast you off, says Jehovah.
{23:34} And the prophet and the priest and the people which shall say, The burden of Jehovah, and I reviewed upon that man, and upon his house.
{23:35} Thus shall ye say, a man to his neighbor, a man to his brother, What answered Jehovah? and what spake Jehovah?
{23:36} And ye shall no more make mention of the burden of Jehovah, for the burden to a man shall be his word; and ye perverted the words of the living God, Jehovah of armies our God.
{23:37} Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What answered Jehovah? and what spake Jehovah?
{23:38} And if ye shall say, The burden of Jehovah; for this, thus said Jehovah, Because ye said this word, The burden of Jehovah, and I shall send to you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of Jehovah:
{23:39} Therefore behold me, and neglecting, I deserted you, and I cast you off, and the city which I gave to you and to your fathers from my face.
{23:40} And I gave upon you an eternal reproach and perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.
{24:1} Jehovah showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs set before the face of the temple of Jehovah, after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel carried away captive Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the chiefs of Judah and the artificers, and the smiths, from Jerusalem, and he will bring them to Babel.
{24:2} One basket of figs exceedingly good as the figs first ripe, and the one basket of figs exceedingly evil, which shall not be eaten from being evil.
{24:3} And Jehovah will say to me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? and saying, Figs: the good figs, exceedingly good; and the evil, exceedingly evil, which shall not be eaten from being evil.
{24:4} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{24:5} Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel: As these good figs, so will I know the captivity of Judah which I sent out of this place to the land of the Chaldeans for good.
{24:6} And I set mine eyes upon them for good, and I turned them back upon this land: and I built them, and I will not pull down: and I planted them, and I will not pluck up.
{24:7} And I gave to them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah: and they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God: for they shall turn back to me with all their heart.
{24:8} And as the evil figs which shall not be eaten from being evil; for thus said Jehovah, So will I give Zedekiah king of Judah, and his chiefs, and the remainder of Jerusalem, those remaining in this land, and those dwelling in the land of Egypt:
{24:9} And I gave them for maltreatment, and for evil to all the kingdoms of the earth, for a reproach and for a parable, and for a derision, and for a curse in, all the places which I shall thrust them away there.
{24:10} And I sent among them the sword, the famine, and the death, even to the consuming them from off the land which I gave to them and to their fathers.
{25:1} The word which was to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year to Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, this the first year to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel.
{25:2} Which Jeremiah the prophet spake to all the people of Judah, all dwelling in Jerusalem, saying,
{25:3} From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, and even to this day, this the three and twentieth year, the word of Jehovah was to me, and I will speak to you, rising early and speaking, and ye heard not.
{25:4} And Jehovah sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending; and ye heard not, and ye inclined not your ear to hear.
{25:5} Saying, Turn back now each from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell upon the land which Jehovah gave to you and to your fathers to from forever and even to forever.
{25:6} And ye shall not go after other gods to serve them and to worship to them, and ye shall not irritate me in the work of your hands; and I will not do evil to you.
{25:7} And ye heard not to me, says Jehovah; so as to irritate me in the works of your hands for evil to you.
{25:8} For this, thus said Jehovah of armies: Because ye heard not my word,
{25:9} Behold me sending, and I took all the families of the north, says Jehovah, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, my servant, and I brought them against this land and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations round about, and I devoted them to destruction, and I set them for a desolation and for a hissing, and for perpetual wastes.
{25:10} And I destroyed from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of the two millstones and the light of the lamp.
{25:11} All this land was for a waste, for a desolation, and these nations served the king of Babel seventy years.
{25:12} And it was when seventy years were filled up, I will review over the king of Babel and upon this nation, says Jehovah, their iniquity, and upon the land of the Chaldeans, and I set it for eternal desolations.
{25:13} And I brought upon this land all the words I spake against it, all being in this book which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations.
{25:14} For many nations they also served upon them, and great kings: and I requited to them according to their work and according to the doings of their hands.
{25:15} For thus said Jehovah God of Israel to me: Take the cup of wine of this wrath from my hand, and cause all the nations which I sent thee to them to drink it.
{25:16} And they drank and they staggered, and they were mad from the face of the sword which I sent in the midst of them.
{25:17} And I shall take the cup from the hand of Jehovah, and I shall cause all the nations which Jehovah sent me to them to drink.
{25:18} Jerusalem and the cities of Judah and her kings, her chiefs, to give them for a waste and for a desolation, and for a hissing and for a cursing; as this day.
{25:19} Pharaoh king of Egypt and his servants, and his chiefs, and all his people.
{25:20} And all the intermingled, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the rovers, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,
{25:21} Edom and Moab and the sons of Ammon,
{25:22} And all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the island which is beyond the sea,
{25:23} Dedan and Tema, and Buz, and all the cutting off the extremity,
{25:24} And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the intermingled dwelling in the desert,
{25:25} And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes.
{25:26} And all the kings of the North, being near and being far off, a man to his brother, and all the kingdoms of the land which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
{25:27} And say to them, thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Drink ye and be drunken, and vomit and fall, and ye shall not rise from the face of the sword which I sent in the midst of you.
{25:28} And it was if they shall refuse to take the cup from my hand to drink, and say to them, Thus said Jehovah of armies: Drink ye; ye shall drink.
{25:29} For behold me beginning to do evil upon the city which my name was called upon it; and shall ye being acquitted be unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished, for I call a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, says Jehovah of armies.
{25:30} And thou shalt prophesy to them all these words, and say to them; Jehovah shall roar from on high, and he will give his voice from his holy habitation; roaring, he will roar from his seat; he shall cry aloud as they treading, to all the inhabitants of the earth.
{25:31} A noise came even to the extremity of the earth; for a strife to Jehovah with the nations; he judged for all flesh; he gave them being evil, to the sword, says Jehovah.
{25:32} Thus said Jehovah of armies, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great storm shall be raised up from the thighs of the earth.
{25:33} And the wounded of Jehovah were in that day from the extremity of the earth and even to the extremity of the earth: they shall not be lamented, and they shall not be gathered, and they shall not be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.
{25:34} Wail, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves, ye chiefs of the flocks; for your days for slaughter and your dispersions were filled up, and ye fell as a vessel of desire.
{25:35} And flight perished from the shepherds, and escaping from the chiefs of the flock.
{25:36} A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and wailing of the chiefs of the flock, for Jehovah laid waste their pasture.
{25:37} And the dwellings of peace were destroyed from the face of the burning of the anger of Jehovah.
{25:38} He forsook his booth as the young lion: for their land was for a desolation from the face of the burning of him oppressing, and from the face of the burning of his anger.
{26:1} In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, was this word from Jehovah, saying,
{26:2} Thus said Jehovah, Stand in the enclosure of the house of Jehovah and speak to all the cities of Judah coming to worship in the house of Jehovah, all the words which I command thee to speak to them; thou shalt not withhold a word.
{26:3} Perhaps they will hear and turn back a man from his evil way, and I lamented for the evil which I purposed to do to them from the face of the evil of their doings.
{26:4} And say to them, Thus said Jehovah, If ye will not hear to me to go in my law which I gave before your face,
{26:5} To hear to the words of my servants the prophets which I sent to you, and rising early and sending, and ye heard not;
{26:6} And I gave this house as Shiloh, and this city I will give for cursing to all the nations of the earth.
{26:7} And the priests and the prophets and all the people will hear Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah.
{26:8} And it will be as Jeremiah finished to speak all which Jehovah commanded to speak to all the people, and the priests and the prophets and all the people will seize him, saying, Dying, thou shalt die.
{26:9} Wherefore didst thou prophesy in the name of Jehovah, saying, This house shall be as Shiloh, and this city shall be laid waste from none inhabiting? And all the people will be convoked together to Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.
{26:10} And the chiefs of Judah will hear these words, and they will come up from the king's house to the house of Jehovah, and they will sit in the opening of the new gate of Jehovah.
{26:11} And the priests and the prophets will say to the chiefs, and to all the people, saying, The judgment of death for this man, for he prophesied against this city, as ye heard with your ears.
{26:12} And Jeremiah will say to all the chiefs and to all the people, saying, Jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words which ye heard.
{26:13} And now make good your ways and your doings, and hear to the voice of Jehovah your God; and Jehovah will lament for the evil which he spake against you.
{26:14} And I, behold me in your hand do to me as the good and right in your eyes:
{26:15} But knowing, ye shall know that if ye put me to death, that ye give innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city, and to her inhabitants: for in truth Jehovah sent me to you to speak in your ears all these words.
{26:16} And the chiefs will say, and all the people to the priests and to the prophets: Not for this man the judgment of death, for in the name of Jehovah his God he spake to us.
{26:17} And men will rise up from the old men of the land, and they will say to all the convocation of the people, saying,
{26:18} Micah the Morasthite was prophesying in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and he will say to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus said Jehovah of armies: Zion shall be ploughed a field, and Jerusalem shall be ruins, and the mountain of the house for the heights of a forest.
{26:19} Putting to death, did Hezekiah king of Judah put him to death, and all Judah? Did he not fear Jehovah, and wait for the face of Jehovah, and Jehovah will lament for the evil which he spake against them? And we are doing great evil against our souls.
{26:20} And also a man was prophesying in the name of Jehovah, Urijah son of Shemaiah, from the city of the forests, and he will prophesy against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.
{26:21} And king Jehoiakim will hear, and all the great ones, and all the chiefs, his words, and the king will seek to kill him: and Urijah will hear and be afraid, and he will flee and go to Egypt.
{26:22} And king Jehoiakim will send men to Egypt, Elnathan, son of Achbor, and men with him to Egypt.
{26:23} And they will bring forth Urijah from Egypt and bring him to king Jehoiakim; and he will strike him with the sword, and cast his carcass into the graves of the sons of the people.
{26:24} But the hand of Ahikam son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah not to give him into the hand of the people to kill him.
{27:1} In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah was this word to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
{27:2} Thus said Jehovah to me: Make to thee bonds and rods and give them upon thy neck,
{27:3} And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the sons of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of messengers coming to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;
{27:4} And command them to say to their lords, Thus said Jehovah of armies God of Israel: Thus shall ye say to your lords:
{27:5} I made the earth, the man and the cattle which are upon the face of the earth, by my great power and by mine arm stretched forth, and I gave it to whom was right in mine eyes.
{27:6} And now I gave all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, my servant; and also the beasts of the field gave I to him to serve him.
{27:7} And all the nations served him, and his son, and his son's son, even till the time itself also of his land came: and many nations and great kings served upon him.
{27:8} And it was the nation and kingdom which shall not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and which shall not give his neck in the yoke of the king of Babel, with the sword and with famine and with death I will review upon that nation, says Jehovah, even to my finishing them by his hand.
{27:9} And ye shall not hear to your prophets and to your divinations, and to your dreamers, and to those of you practicing magic, and to your sorcerers, which they are saying to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babel:
{27:10} For they are prophesying a lie to you so as to remove you far off from your land; and I thrust you away, and ye perished.
{27:11} And the nation which shall bring his neck into the yoke of the king of Babel and serve him, and I gave him rest upon his land, says Jehovah; and he worked it, and dwelt in it.
{27:12} And to Zedekiah king of Judah I spake according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks into the yoke of the king of Babel, and serve him and his people, and live.
{27:13} Wherefore will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword and by famine and by death, as Jehovah spake against the nation who will not serve the king of Babel?
{27:14} And ye shall not bear to the words of the prophets, saying to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babel; for they are prophesying a lie to you.
{27:15} For I sent them not, says Jehovah, and they are prophesying in my name for falsehood; for my thrusting you away, and ye perish, ye, and the prophets prophesying to you.
{27:16} And to the priests and to all this people I spake, saying, Thus said Jehovah: Ye shall not hear to the words of your prophets prophesying to you, saying, Behold the vessels of the house of Jehovah being now turned back from Babel speedily: for they are prophesying a lie to you.
{27:17} Ye shall not hear to them; serve ye the king of Babel, and live: wherefore shall this city be laid waste?
{27:18} And if they be prophets, and if the word of Jehovah be with them, they shall now supplicate to Jehovah of armies for the vessels being left in the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king of Judah, in Jerusalem, not to go into Babel.
{27:19} For thus said Jehovah of armies concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the remainder of the vessels being left in this city.
{27:20} Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel took them not in his carrying away captive Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem into Babel, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem.
{27:21} For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, concerning the vessels being left in the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king of Judah and Jerusalem:
{27:22} They shall be brought to Babel, and there shall they be till the day of my reviewing them, says Jehovah; and I brought them up and turned them back to this place.
{28:1} And it will be in this year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah son of Azur the prophet which was from the hill, said to me in the house of Jehovah, before the eyes of the priests, and all the people, saying,
{28:2} Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, saving, I broke the yoke of the king of Babel.
{28:3} In yet two years of days I turn back to this place all the vessels of the house of Jehovah which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel took from this place, and brought them to Babel.
{28:4} And Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim King of Judah, and all the captivity of Judah going to Babel, I turn back to this place, says Jehovah; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babel.
{28:5} And Jeremiah the prophet will say to Hansaiah the prophet, before the eyes of the priests and before the eyes of all the people standing in the house of Jehovah,
{28:6} And Jeremiah the prophet will say, Verily: so will Jehovah do: will Jehovah raise up thy words which thou didst prophesy, to turn back the vessels of the house of Jehovah, and all the captivity from Babel to this place.
{28:7} But hear now this word which I speak in thine ears and in the ears of all the people.
{28:8} The prophets which were before me and before thee from of old, and they will prophesy to many lands and against great kingdoms, for war and for evil and for death.
{28:9} The prophet which will prophesy for peace in the coming of the word of the prophet, the prophet shall be known: that Jehovah sent him in truth.
{28:10} And Hananiah the prophet will take the yoke from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, and break it.
{28:11} And Hananiah will say before the eyes of all the people, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Thus will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babel in yet two years of days from off the neck of all the nations. And Jeremiah the prophet will go to his way.
{28:12} And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet broke the yoke from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
{28:13} Go and say to Hananiah, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Thou didst break the staves of wood; but make instead of them staves of iron.
{28:14} For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, I gave an iron yoke upon the neck of all these nations to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel: and they served him: and also the beasts of the field I gave to him.
{28:15} And Jeremiah the prophet will say to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; Jehovah sent thee not; and thou didst cause this people to trust upon falsehood.
{28:16} For this, thus said Jehovah, Behold me sending thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou diest, because thou spakest turning away against Jehovah.
{28:17} And Hananiah the prophet will die in this year in the seventh month.
{29:1} And these the words of the writing which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the remnant of the old men of the captivity, and to the priests and to the prophets, and to all the people which Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babel;
{29:2} (After the going forth of Jeconiah, the king and the mistress, and the eunuchs, the chiefs of Judah and Jerusalem, and the artificers, and the smiths, from Jerusalem;)
{29:3} By the hand of Elasah son of Shaphan, and Gemariah, son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, into Babel) saying,
{29:4} Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, to all the captivity, which I caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem into Babel:
{29:5} Build ye houses and dwell; and plant gardens and eat their fruit:
{29:6} Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and ye shall give your daughters to husbands, and they shall bring forth sons and daughters: and ye be increased there, and ye shall not be diminished.
{29:7} And seek ye the peace of the city where I caused you to be carried away captive there, and pray for it to Jehovah; for in her peace, peace shall be to you.
{29:8} For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Your prophets in the midst of you shall not deceive to you, and your diviners and you shall not hear to your dreams which ye dream.
{29:9} For they are prophesying in falsehood to you in my name: I sent them not, says Jehovah.
{29:10} For thus said Jehovah, That according to the filling up to Babel of seventy years I will review you and lift up to you my good word to turn you back to this place.
{29:11} For I knew the purposes which I purposed concerning you, says Jehovah; purposes of peace, and not for evil, to give to you the last part and expectation.
{29:12} And ye called me, and went and prayed to me, and I heard to you.
{29:13} And ye sought me and found, for ye will seek me with all your heart.
{29:14} And I was found to you, says Jehovah: and I turned back your captivity, and I gathered you from all the nations, and from all the places where I thrust you away there says Jehovah; and I turned you back to the place where I caused you to be carried away captive from thence.
{29:15} For ye said Jehovah raised up to us prophets in Babel.
{29:16} For thus said Jehovah to the king sitting upon the throne of David, and to all the people dwelling in this city, your brethren which went not forth with you into captivity.
{29:17} Thus said Jehovah of armies, Behold me sending upon them the sword, the famine, and the death, and I gave them as evil figs which shall not be eaten from being evil.
{29:18} And I pursued after them with the sword, with famine and with death, and I gave them for agitation to all the kingdoms of the earth, for a curse and for astonishment, and for hissing and for a reproach among all the nations which I thrust them away there:
{29:19} For that they heard not to my word, says Jehovah, which I sent to them with my servants the prophets, rising early and sending; and ye heard not, says Jehovah.
{29:20} And hear ye the word of Jehovah, all the captivity which I sent from Jerusalem into Babel.
{29:21} Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, to Ahab son of Kolaiah, and to Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, prophesying a lie to you in my name; Behold, I gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and he struck them before your eyes;
{29:22} And a curse was taken from them to all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, Jehovah will set thee as Zedekiah, and as Ahab, whom the king of Babel roasted them in fire;
{29:23} Because they did folly in Israel, and they will commit adultery with their neighbors' wives, and they will speak the word of a lie in my name, which I commanded them not; and I know, and a witness, says Jehovah.
{29:24} And to Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shalt say, saying,
{29:25} Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, saying, Because thou didst send writings as thy name to all the people which are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, and to the priests, saying,
{29:26} Jehovah gave thee priest instead of Jehoida the priest to be overseers of the house of Jehovah, and for every man raving and prophesying, and give him to the stocks and to the prison.
{29:27} And now wherefore didst thou not reprove with Jeremiah of Anathoth prophesying to you?
{29:28} For, for this, he sent to us in Babel, saying, This is long: build ye houses, and inhabit; plant gardens, and eat their fruit.
{29:29} And Zephaniah the priest will read this writing in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
{29:30} And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,
{29:31} Send to all the captivity, saying, Thus said Jehovah to Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because Shemaiah prophesied to you, and I sent him not, and he will cause you to trust in falsehood:
{29:32} For this, thus said Jehovah, Behold me reviewing upon Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and upon his seed: there shall not be to him a man in the midst of this people; and he shall not look upon the good I do to ray people, says Jehovah; for he spake turning away against Jehovah.
{30:1} The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
{30:2} Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, saying, Write for thee all the words which I spake to thee upon the writing.
{30:3} For behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I turned back the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, said Jehovah: and I turned them back to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they shall inherit it.
{30:4} And these the words which Jehovah spake to Israel and to Judah.
{30:5} For thus said Jehovah; We heard the voice of fear and of terror, and not of peace.
{30:6} Ask ye now, and see if a male brought forth? wherefore did I see every man his hands upon his loins as she bringing forth, and all faces were turned to paleness?
{30:7} Alas! for that day is great from none being like it: and this the time of straits to Jacob and he shall be saved from it.
{30:8} And it was in that day, says Jehovah of armies, I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and I will tear away thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve upon him.
{30:9} And they served Jehovah their God, and David their king whom I will raise up to them.
{30:10} And thou my servant Jacob shall not fear, says Jehovah, and thou Israel shalt not be dismayed: for behold me saving thee from far off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob turned back and rested, and was quiet, and none making afraid.
{30:11} For I am with thee, says Jehovah, to serve thee: for I will make a completion to all nations where I scattered thee there, but with thee I will not make a completion: and I corrected thee for judgment, and acquitting, I will not let thee go unpunished.
{30:12} For thus said Jehovah, Thy breaking is incurable, and thy blow sickly.
{30:13} None judging thy judgment for binding up: no healing will come up to thee.
{30:14} All loving thee forgat thee; they will not seek thee; for I struck thee the blow of an enemy, the correction of the cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; thy sins were strong.
{30:15} Why wilt thou cry for thy breaking? thy pain is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: thy sins were strong, I did these things to thee.
{30:16} For this, all consuming thee shall be consumed; and all thine adversaries, all of them shall go into captivity; and they spoiling thee, were for spoiling, and all plundering thee I will give to plunder.
{30:17} For I will bring up healing to thee, and I will heal thee of thy blows, says Jehovah: for they called to thee an outcast: This is Zion, none seeking for her.
{30:18} Thus said Jehovah, Behold me turning back the captivity of Jacob's tents, and I will compassionate his habitations; and the city was built upon her hill, and the palace sat upon its judgment.
{30:19} And thanksgiving shall go forth from them, and the voice of those playing, and I multiplied them, and they shall not be few; and I honored them, and they shall not be small.
{30:20} And their sons were as of old, and their testimony shall be prepared before me, and I reviewed upon all pressing them,
{30:21} And his mighty one was from himself, and his ruler shall go forth from his midst; and I caused him to draw near, and he came near to me: for who this pledging his heart to approach to me? says Jehovah.
{30:22} And ye were to me for a people, and I will be to you for God.
{30:23} Behold, the storm of Jehovah went forth with wrath, a cutting storm: it shall be hurled upon the head of the wicked.
{30:24} The burning of the anger of Jehovah shall not turn, back till his doing, and till his setting up the thoughts of his heart: in the last of the days ye shall have understanding in it.
{31:1} In that time, says Jehovah, I will be for God to all the families of Israel, and they shall be to me for a people.
{31:2} Thus said Jehovah, The people escaped of the sword found grace in the desert; Israel going to cause him to rest.
{31:3} Jehovah was seen to me from afar off; and I loved thee an eternal love: for this I drew thee in kindness.
{31:4} I will yet build thee, and thou wert built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt yet be adorned with the tabret, and thou wentest forth into the dance of those playing.
{31:5} Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Shomeron: they planting, planted, and they made common.
{31:6} For there is a day they watching upon mount Ephraim called, Arise ye, and we will go up to Zion to Jehovah our God.
{31:7} For thus said Jehovah, Shout gladness to Jacob, and cry aloud to the head of the nations: cause ye to be heard, praise ye and say, O Jehovah save thy people, the remnant of Israel.
{31:8} Behold me bringing them from the land of the north, and I gathered them from the thighs of the earth, with them the blind and the lame, her being Pregnant, and her bringing forth together: a great convocation shall turn back hither.
{31:9} In weeping will they come, and I will lead them in mercies; I will cause them to go to the streams of waters in a straight way; they shall not stumble in it: for I was to Israel for a father, and Ephraim he is my first-born.
{31:10} Hear the word of Jehovah, ye nations, and announce in the islands from far off, and say, He scattering Israel will gather him, and watch him as the shepherd his flock.
{31:11} For Jehovah redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of the stronger than he.
{31:12} And they came and shouted in the height of Zion, and they flowed together to the goodness of Jehovah, for the grain and for the new wine, and for the oil, and for the sons of the flock and the herd: and their soul was as a watered garden, and they shall not add to pine away any more.
{31:13} Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and old men together: and I turned their mourning to joy, and I comforted them and caused them to rejoice from their sorrow.
{31:14} And I satiated the soul of the priests with fatness and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, says Jehovah.
{31:15} Thus said Jehovah, A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping of bitterness; Rachel, weeping for her sons, refused to be comforted for her sons, for they are not.
{31:16} Thus said Jehovah, Restrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for there is a reward to thy work, says Jehovah; and they turned back from the land of the enemy.
{31:17} And there is hope to thy latter state, says Jehovah, and thy sons turned back to their bound.
{31:18} Hearing, I heard Ephraim being thrust away: Thou didst correct me, and I shall be corrected as a calf not being taught: turn me back and I shall be turned back, for thou Jehovah my God.
{31:19} For after my being turned back I was comforted; and after my knowing I struck upon the thigh: I was ashamed and also disgraced for I bore the reproach of my youth.
{31:20} Is Ephraim a precious son to me? if a child of delights? for whenever my speaking against him, remembering, I shall remember him yet; for this the bowels were put in motion to me compassionating, I will compassionate him, says Jehovah.
{31:21} Set up to thee thorns, set to thee bitternesses: place thy heart to the highway, the way thou wentest: turn back, O virgin of Israel, turn back to these thy cities.
{31:22} How long wilt thou wander about, O daughter turning away? for Jehovah created a new thing in the earth: A female shall go about a male.
{31:23} Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel: Yet shall they say this word in the land of Judah and in its cities, in my turning back their captivity; Jehovah shall bless thee, thou habitation of justice, thou mountain of holiness.
{31:24} And in Judah shall dwell in it, and in all its cities together, husbandmen, and they removed with the flock.
{31:25} For I satiated the weary soul, and every soul pining away I filled.
{31:26} Upon this I awoke, and I shall see; and my sleep sweet to me.
{31:27} Behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I sowed the house of Israel and the house of Judah, the seed of man and the seed of beast.
{31:28} And it was as I watched over them to pluck up and to break down, and to destroy and to cut off, and to break in pieces; so will I watch over them to build and to plant, says Jehovah.
{31:29} In those days they shall no more say, The fathers ate sour grapes and the sons teeth will be blunted.
{31:30} But each shall die in his iniquity: every man eating the sour grape, his teeth shall become dull.
{31:31} Behold the days coming, says Jehovah, and I cut out the house of Israel and the house of Judah a new covenant.
{31:32} Not according to the covenant which I cut out with their fathers in the day I laid hold upon their hand to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt; which they brake my covenant, and I was Lord over them, says Jehovah.
{31:33} For this the covenant that I will cut out with the house of Israel: After those days, says Jehovah; I gave my law in the midst of them, and upon their heart will I write it; and I was to them for God, and they shall be to me for a people.
{31:34} And they shall teach no more a man his neighbor and a man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah: for they all shall know me to their small and even to their great, says Jehovah: for I will forgive their iniquity, and to their sin I will have no more remembrance.
{31:35} Thus said Jehovah, giving the sun for light the day, the laws of the moon and the stars for a light the night, causing the sea to tremble, and its waves shall roar; Jehovah of armies his name.
{31:36} If these laws shall depart from my face, says Jehovah, also the seed of Israel shall cease from being a nation before me all the days.
{31:37} Thus said Jehovah: If the heavens from above shall be measured, and the foundations of the earth shall be searched out beneath, I also will reject in all the seed of Israel for all which they did, says Jehovah.
{31:38} Behold the days, says Jehovah, and the city was built to Jehovah, from the tower of Hananeel, even to the gate of the corner.
{31:39} And the line of measure shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and it went about Goath.
{31:40} And all the valley of the carcasses and the ashes, and all the fields even to the torrent Kidron, even to the corner of the gate of horses, from the sunrising, a holy place to Jehovah; it shall not be plucked up, and it shall no more be destroyed forever.
{32:1} The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year to Zedekiah king of Judah, this year the eighteenth year to Nebuchadnezzar.
{32:2} And then the strength of the king of Babel pressed upon Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the enclosure of the prison which was in the house of the king of Judah.
{32:3} For Zedekiah king of Judah shut him up, saying, Wherefore prophesiest thou, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving this city into the hand of the king of Babel, and he took it.
{32:4} And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, for giving, he shall be given into the hand of the king of Babel, and speaking to him, his mouth with his mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes:
{32:5} And he shall call Zedekiah to go to Babel, and he shall be there till my reviewing him, says Jehovah: if ye shall war with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.
{32:6} And Jeremiah will say, The word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
{32:7} Behold, Hanameel son of Shallum thine uncle, coming to thee, saying, Buy to thee my field which is in Anathoth: for to thee the judgment of redemption today.
{32:8} And Hanameel mine uncle's son will come to me according to the word of Jehovah, to the enclosure of the prison, and he will say to me, Buy now, my field, which is in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin: for to thee judgment of possession, and to thee the redemption; buy to thee, and I shall know that this is the word of Jehovah.
{32:9} And I shall buy the field of Hanameel son of mine uncle, which is in Anathoth; and I shall weigh to him seven shekels and ten of silver.
{32:10} And I shall write in a book, and seal and affirm witnesses, and weigh the silver in the balances.
{32:11} And I will take the book of the purchase, being sealed, the command and laws, and being unrolled:
{32:12} And I shall give the writing of the purchase to Baruch, son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, before the eyes of Hanameel mine uncle, and before the eyes of the witnesses, writing in the book of the purchase before the eves of all the Jews sitting in the enclosure of the prison.
{32:13} And I shall command Baruch before their eyes, saying,
{32:14} Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, take these writings, this writing of the purchase, and the sealed, and this writing unrolled, and give them into an earthern vessel, so that they shall stand many days.
{32:15} For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet be bought in this land.
{32:16} And I shall pray to Jehovah, after my giving the writing of the purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, saying,
{32:17} Thou Lord Jehovah! behold thou madest the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thine arm stretched forth; any word shall not be separated from thee.
{32:18} Doing kindness to thousands and requiting the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them: The Great, The Strong God, Jehovah of armies his name.
{32:19} Great of counsel, and vast of doing: for thine eyes being opened upon all the ways of the sons of men to give to each according to his ways, and to the fruit of his doings:
{32:20} Who set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, and in Israel, and in man; and thou wilt make to thee a name according to this day.
{32:21} And thou wilt bring forth thy people Israel from the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an arm stretched forth, and with great fear:
{32:22} And thou wilt give to them this land which thou swarest to their fathers to give to them, a land flowing milk and honey.
{32:23} And they will come in and possess it; and they heard not to thy voice, and they went not in thy law; all which thou didst command to them to do they did not, and thou wilt cause all this evil to befall them.
{32:24} Behold the mounds, they came to the city to take it; and the city was given into the hand of the Chaldees warring against it from the face of the sword, and the famine, and the death; and it was what thou spakest; and behold thee seeing.
{32:25} And thou saidst to me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy to thee the field for silver, and affirm witnesses; and the city was given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
{32:26} And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,
{32:27} Behold, I am Jehovah, God of all flesh: is there any word separated from me?
{32:28} For this, thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and he took it.
{32:29} And the Chaldeans warring against this city came, and they burnt this city in fire, and they burnt it and the houses which they burnt incense upon their roofs to Baal, and they poured out libations to other gods to irritate me.
{32:30} For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah were only doing evil in mine eyes from their youth: for the sons of Israel were only irritating me with the work of their hands, says Jehovah.
{32:31} For this city was to me for mine anger and for my wrath, from the day which they built it and even to this day, to remove it from my face.
{32:32} For all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah which they did to irritate me, they, their kings, their chiefs, their priests, and their prophets, and the man Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
{32:33} And they will turn to me the neck and not the face: and teaching them, and rising early and teaching, and they not hearing to receive instruction.
{32:34} And they will set their abominations in the house which my name was called upon it, to defile it.
{32:35} And they will build the heights of Baal which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through to Molech, which I commanded them not; and it came not up upon my heart to do this abomination to cause Judah to sin.
{32:36} And now for this, thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, to this city of which ye are saying, It was given into the hand of the king of Babel by sword and by famine, and by death.
{32:37} Behold me gathering them from all the lands where I thrust them away there in mine anger, and in my wrath, and in great anger; and I turned them back to this place, and I caused them to dwell with confidence.
{32:38} And they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God.
{32:39} And I gave to them one heart and one way, to fear me all the days, for good to them and to their sons after them.
{32:40} And I cut out to them an eternal covenant that I will not turn back from after them, to do them good; and I will give my fear in their heart not to turn away from me.
{32:41} And I rejoiced over them to do them good, and I planted them in this land in truth with all my heart and with all my soul.
{32:42} For thus said Jehovah, As I brought to this people all this great evil, so I bring upon them all the good which I speak concerning them.
{32:43} And the field was purchased in in this land which ye are saying, It is a desolation without man and cattle; it was given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
{32:44} They shall buy fields with silver, and write thou in the book, and seal and affirm witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountain, and in the cities of the low country, and in the cities of the south: for I will turn back their captivity, says Jehovah.
{33:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah the second time, and he yet shut up in the enclosure of the prison, saying,
{33:2} Thus said Jehovah making it Jehovah forming it, to prepare it, Jehovah his name:
{33:3} Call to me and I will answer thee, and I will announce to thee great and mighty things which thou knewest them not.
{33:4} For thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, being torn away to the mounds and to the sword;
{33:5} Coming to war with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the corpses of man whom I struck in mine anger and in my wrath, and that I hid my face from this city for all their wickedness.
{33:6} Behold me bringing up to it health and healing, and healing them, and I uncovered to them the abundance of peace and truth.
{33:7} And I turned back the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel and I built them as at the first.
{33:8} And I cleansed them from all their iniquity which they sinned to me, and which they transgressed against me.
{33:9} And it was to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for an honor to all the nations of the earth who shall hear all the good which I did them: and they trembled and were moved for all the good and for all the peace which I did to it.
{33:10} Thus said Jehovah: Yet shall be heard in this place which ye were saying it was laid waste without man and without cattle, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, being desolate without man and without inhabitant, and without cattle,
{33:11} The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those saying, Praise ye Jehovah of armies: for Jehovah is good, for his mercy is forever: of them bringing thanksgiving to the house of Jehovah; for I will turn back the captivity of the land as at the first, said Jehovah.
{33:12} Thus said Jehovah of armies: Yet shall be in this place being laid waste without man and without cattle, and in all its cities, the habitation of the shepherds causing the sheep to lie down.
{33:13} In the cities of the mountain, in the cities of the low country, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the sheep yet pass through upon the hand of him numbering, said Jehovah.
{33:14} Behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I raised up the good word which I spake to the house of Israel and for the house of Judah.
{33:15} In those days and in that time I will cause the sprout of justice to spring up to David; and he did judgment and justice in the land.
{33:16} In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell with confidence; and this is what shall be called to her: Jehovah our Justice.
{33:17} For thus said Jehovah, I will not cut off to David a man sitting upon the throne of the house of Israel;
{33:18} And to the priests, the Levites, I will not cut off a man from my face bringing up burnt-offerings, and burning the gift, and doing sacrifice all the days.
{33:19} And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,
{33:20} Thus said Jehovah, If ye shall break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night, and there was not day and night in their season;
{33:21} Also my covenant shall be broken with David ray servant from there being to him a son reigning upon his throne; and with the Levites, the priests, from serving me.
{33:22} As the army of the heavens shall not be numbered and the sand of the sea shall not be measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites serving me.
{33:23} And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,
{33:24} Sawest thou not what this people spake, saying, The two families which Jehovah chose in them, and he will reject them? and they will despise my people from being yet a nation before them.
{33:25} Thus said Jehovah, If not my covenant of the day and of the night, the laws of the heavens and the earth I set not up.
{33:26} Also the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, will I reject from taking from his seed those ruling over the seed of Abraham, Isaak, and Jacob for I will turn back their captivity, and I compassionated them.
{34:1} The word that was to Jeremiah from Jehovah and Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and all his strength, and all the kingdoms of the earth, the dominion of his hand, and all the peoples warring against Jerusalem, and against all its cities, saying.
{34:2} Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Go and say to Zedekiah king of Judah, and say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving this city into the band of the king of Babel, and he burnt it with fire.
{34:3} And thou shalt not escape from his hand, for being seized, thou shalt be seized and be given into his hand; and thine eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babel, and his mouth shall speak to thy mouth, and thou shalt go to Babel.
{34:4} But hear the word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah, king of Judah: Thus said Jehovah concerning thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:
{34:5} In peace shalt thou die; and with the burnings of thy fathers the former kings which were before thee, thus shall they burn for thee; and, Alas, Lord they shall mourn for thee; for I spake the word, says Jehovah.
{34:6} And Jeremiah the prophet will speak to Zedekiah king of Judah all these words in Jerusalem.
{34:7} And the strength of the king of Babel warred against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah being left against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these remained of the cities of Judah, fortified cities.
{34:8} The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah after king Zedekiah cut out a covenant with all the people which were in Jerusalem, to call to them liberty;
{34:9} For a man to send away his servant, and a man his maid, the Hebrew or the Hebrewess, free; for a man not to serve with them with a Jew his brother.
{34:10} And all the chiefs will hear, and all the people which came into the covenant, to send away a man his servant and a man his maid, free, no more to serve with them, and they will hear and will send away.
{34:11} And they will turn back after this, and they will cause their servants and their maids to turn back whom they sent away free, and they subdued them for servants and for maids.
{34:12} And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
{34:13} Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, I cut out a covenant with your fathers in the day of my bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants, saying,
{34:14} From the end of seven years ye shall send away a man his brother, the Hebrew who shall be sold to thee, and serving thee six years, and send him away free from thee; and your fathers heard not to me and inclined not their ear.
{34:15} And ye will turn back today and do the straight in mine eyes, to call liberty a man to his neighbor; and ye will cut out a covenant before me in the house which my name was called upon it.
{34:16} And ye will turn back and pollute my name, and ye will cause to turn back a man his servant and a man his maid, whom ye sent away free to their soul, and ye will subdue them to be to you for servants and for maids.
{34:17} For this, thus said Jehovah, Ye heard not to me to call liberty, a man to his brother and a man to his neighbor behold me calling to you liberty, says Jehovah, to the sword, to the death and to the famine; and I gave you for agitation to all the kingdoms of the earth.
{34:18} And I gave the men passing by my covenant who raised not up the words of the covenant which they cut out before me, the calf which they cut in two, and they will pass through between its parts.
{34:19} The chiefs of Judah, and the chiefs of Jerusalem, the eunuchs and the priests, and all the people of the land passing between the parts of the calf.
{34:20} And I gave them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those seeking their soul; and their corpses were for food to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the earth.
{34:21} And Zedekiah, king of Judah, and his chiefs, I will give into the hand of their enemies, and, into the hand of those seeking their soul, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babel going up from you.
{34:22} Behold me commanding, says Jehovah; and I turned them back to this city, and they warred against it and took it, and burnt it in fire: and the cities of Judah will I give to desolation from none inhabiting.
{35:1} The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
{35:2} Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak with them, and bring them to the house of Jehovah, to one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.
{35:3} And I shall take Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habazaniah and his brethren, and all his sons, and all the house of the Rechabites;
{35:4} And I shall bring them to the house of Jehovah to the chamber of the sons of Hanan, son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was near the chamber of the chiefs, which was from above to the chamber of Maaseiah, son of Shallum, watching the threshold.
{35:5} And I shall give before the sons of the house of the Rechabites, pots full of wine, and cups, and saying to them, Drink ye wine.
{35:6} And they will say, We shall not drink wine: for Jonadab, son of Rechab our father, commanded to us, saying, Ye shall not drink wine, ye and your sons even to forever.
{35:7} And ye shall not build a house, and ye shall not sow seed, and ye shall not plant a vineyard, and it shall not be, to you: for in tents shall ye dwell all your days, so that ye shall live many days upon the face of the earth where ye are strangers there.
{35:8} And we will hear to the voice of Jonadab son of Rechab our father, for all which he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters;
{35:9} Not to build houses for our dwelling; and vineyard and field and seed shall not be to us.
{35:10} And we will dwell in tents, and we will hear and we will do according to all which Jonadab our father commanded us.
{35:11} And it will be in the coming up of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, to the land, and we shall say, Come, and we will go to Jerusalem from the face of the army of the Chaldean, and from the face of the army of Aram, and we will dwell in Jerusalem.
{35:12} And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,
{35:13} Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Go and say to the man Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hear to my word? says Jehovah.
{35:14} The words of Jonadab son of Rechab who commanded his sons not to drink wine, were raised up; and they drank not even to this clay, for they heard the command of their father: and spake to you, rising early and speaking; and ye heard not to me.
{35:15} And I shall send to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending, saying, Turn ye back now each from his evil way, and make good your doings, and ye shall not go after other gods to serve them, and turn ye back to the land which I gave to you and to your fathers: and ye inclined not your ear and ye heard not to me.
{35:16} For the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab raised up the commands of their father which be commanded them; and this people heard not to me.
{35:17} For this, thus said Jehovah, God of armies, God of Israel, Behold me bringing to Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, all the evil which I spake concerning them; because I spake to them and they heard not; and I shall call to them and they answered not.
{35:18} And Jeremiah said to the house of the Reehabites, Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Because that ye heard to the command of Jonadab your father, and ye will watch all his commands, and ye will do all which he commanded you:
{35:19} For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, A man shall not be cut off to Jonadab son of Rechab, to stand before my face all the days.
{36:1} And it will be in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah king of Judah, this word being to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
{36:2} Take to thee a roll of writing, and write in it all the words which I spake to thee against Israel and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake to thee from the days of Josiah and even to this day.
{36:3} Perhaps the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them; so that they will turn back each from his evil way; and I pardoned their iniquity and their sin.
{36:4} And Jeremiah will call Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch will write from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah which he spake to him upon the roll of the book.
{36:5} And Jeremiah will command Baruch, saying, I being shut up shall not be able to go into the house of Jehovah:
{36:6} And go thou and read in the roll which thou wrotest from my mouth, the words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in the house of Jehovah in the day of fasting: and also in the ears of all Judah coming from their cities thou shalt read them.
{36:7} Perhaps their mercy will fall before the face of Jehovah, and they will turn back each from his evil way: for great the anger and the wrath which Jehovah spake against this people.
{36:8} And Baruch son of Neriah will do according to all which Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, to read in the book the words of Jehovah in the house of Jehovah.
{36:9} And it will be in the fifth year to Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, they called a fast before Jehovah to all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people coming from the cities of Judah into Jerusalem.
{36:10} And Baruch will read in the book all the words of Jeremiah hi the house of Jehovah in the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe, in the enclosure the highest of the entrance of the new gate of the house of Jehovah, in the ears of all the people.
{36:11} And Micaiah son of Gemariah son of Shaphan, will hear all the words of Jehovah from the book.
{36:12} And he will go down to the house of the king to the scribe's chamber, and behold, there all the chiefs sitting, Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan son of Achbor, and Gemariah son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the chiefs.
{36:13} And Micaiah will announce to them all the words which he heard in the reading of Baruch in the book in the ears of the people.
{36:14} And all the chiefs will send to Baruch, Jehudi, son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, saying, The roll in which thou readest in the ears of the people, take it in thy hand and come. And Baruch the son of Neriah will take the roll in his hand, and come to them.
{36:15} And they will say to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears And Baruch will read in their ears.
{36:16} And it will be when they heard all the words, they trembled, a man with his neighbor, and they will say to Baruch, Announcing, we will announce to the king all these words.
{36:17} And they asked Baruch, saying, Announce now to us how thou didst write all these words from his mouth?
{36:18} And Baruch will say to them, From his mouth he will read to me all these words, and I will write upon the book with ink.
{36:19} And the chiefs will say to Baruch, Go hide, thou, and Jeremiah; and a man not knowing where ye are.
{36:20} And they will come in to the king to the enclosure, and they deposited the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and they will announce all the words in the ears of the king.
{36:21} And the king will send Jehudi to take the roll: and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi will read in the ears of the king and in the ears of all the chiefs standing from about the king.
{36:22} And the king will sit in the winter house in the ninth month, and a furnace burning before him.
{36:23} And it will be as Jehudi read three columns and four, he will rend it with the knife of the scribe, and cast into the fire which was in the furnace, even till all the roll was consumed upon the fire which was upon the furnace.
{36:24} And they trembled not, and they rent not their garments, the king and all his servants hearing all these words.
{36:25} And also Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah supplicated to the king not to burn the roll: and he heard to them not.
{36:26} And the king commanded Jerahmeel, son of the king, and Seraiah, son of Azriel, and Shelemiah, son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; and Jehovah will hide them.
{36:27} And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah after the king burnt the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
{36:28} Turn back, take to thee another roll, and write upon it all the former words which were upon the first roll which Jehoiakim king of Judah, burnt.
{36:29} And to Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shalt say, Thus said Jehovah, Thou didst burn this roll, saying, Wherefore didst thou write upon it, saying, Coining, the king of Babel shall come and destroy this land, and cause to cease from it man and cattle?
{36:30} For this, thus said Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim, king of Judah, He sitting upon the throne of David shall not be to him, and his corpse shall be cast out to the heat in the day, and to the cold in the night.
{36:31} And I reviewed upon him, and upon his seed, and upon his servants, their iniquity; and I brought upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah all the evil which I spake against them, and they heard not.
{36:32} And Jeremiah took another roll, and he will give it to Baruch son of Neriah the scribe; and he will write upon it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoialtim king of Judah burnt in the fire: and he added yet to them many words like them.
{37:1} And king Zedekiah son of Josiah will reign instead of Coniah son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel made king in the land of Judah.
{37:2} And he heard not, he and his servants, and the people of the land, to the words of Jehovah which he spake by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet.
{37:3} And king Zedekiah will send Jehucal son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah, son of Maaseiah the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Pray now for us to Jehovah our God.
{37:4} And Jeremiah came and went forth in the midst of the people and they gave him not to the house of the prison.
{37:5} And Pharaoh's army came forth out of Egypt; and the Chaldeans pressing upon Jerusalem will hear their report, and they will come up from Jerusalem.
{37:6} And the word of Jehovah, will be to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
{37:7} Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah sending you to me to seek me out, Behold the army of Pharaoh coming forth to you for help, turning back to its land of Egypt.
{37:8} And the Chaldeans turned back and mimed against this city, and took hand burnt it with fire.
{37:9} Thus said Jehovah, Ye shall not lift up Your souls, saying, Departing, the Chaldeans will go from us: for they shall not go.
{37:10} For if ye struck all the army of the Chaldeans warring with you, and men thrust through remained among them, they shall arise a man in his tent and burn this city in fire.
{37:11} And it was in the going up of the army of the Chaldees from the face of the army of Pharaoh.
{37:12} And Jeremiah went forth from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to distribute from thence in the midst of the people.
{37:13} And he will be in the gate of Benjamin, and there a master of the ward and his name Irijah son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah; and he will take Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest to the Chaldeans.
{37:14} And Jeremiah will say, A falsehood; I fall not to the Chaldean: And he heard not to him: and Irijah will seize upon Jeremiah and he will bring him to the chiefs.
{37:15} And the chiefs will be angry against Jeremiah and they struck him, and gave him to the house of bonds the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they made it for a house of prison.
{37:16} For Jeremiah came to the house of the pit, and to the vaults, and Jeremiah sat there many days.
{37:17} And king Zedekiah will send and take him, and the king will ask him in his house in secret, and say, Is there a word from Jehovah? and Jeremiah will say, There is: and he will say, Into the hand of the king of Babel shalt thou be given.
{37:18} And Jeremiah will say to king Zedekiah, What did I sin against thee, and against thy servants, and against this people that thou gavest me to the house of the prison?
{37:19} And where now your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babel shall not come against you and against this land?
{37:20} And now, hear now my lord the king: my mercy shall fall now before thy face, and thou shalt not cause me to turn back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, and I shall not die there.
{37:21} And king Zedekiah will command, and they will commit Jeremiah to the enclosure of the prison, and giving to him a round of bread for the day from the street of the baker's, till all the bread was consumed out of the city. And Jeremiah dwelt in the enclosure of the prison.
{38:1} And Shephatiah son of Mattan, will hear, and Gedaliah son of Pashur, and Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashur son of Malchiah, the words which Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying,
{38:2} Thus said Jehovah, He dwelling in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by death; and he going forth to the Chaldeans shall live; and his soul was to him for booty, and he lived.
{38:3} Thus said Jehovah, Being given, this city shall be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babel, and he took it.
{38:4} And the chiefs will say to the king, Now shall this man be put to death: for thus he is relaxing the hands of the men of war remaining in this city, and the hands of all the people to speak to them according to these words; for this man sought not for peace to this people but for evil.
{38:5} And king Zedekiah will say, Behold him in your hands; for the king will not be able a word with you.
{38:6} And they will take Jeremiah and send him to the pit of Malchiah son of the king which was in the enclosure of the prison: and they will cast Jeremiah with cords, and in the pit no water but mud: and Jeremiah will sink in the mud.
{38:7} And the king's servant, the Cushite, a man, an eunuch, will hear, and he in the house of the king, that they gave Jeremiah to the pit; and the king sitting in the gate of Benjamin.
{38:8} And the king's servant went forth from the house of the king, and he will speak to the king, saying,
{38:9} My lord the king, these men did evil all which they did to Jeremiah the prophet whom they cast into the pit; and he will die in his low place from the face of hunger, for no more bread in the city.
{38:10} And the king will command the king's servant the Cushite, saying, Take in thy hand from here thirty men, and bring up Jeremiah the prophet from the pit before he shall die.
{38:11} And the king's servant will take the men in his hand and go to the house of the king under the store-house, and he will take from thence old torn rags, and rags rubbed small, and he will cast them to Jeremiah into the pit with cords.
{38:12} And the king's servant the Cushite will say to Jeremiah, Put now the old rags torn and rubbed small, under the joints of thy hands from under the cords; and Jeremiah will do so.
{38:13} And they will draw up Jeremiah with the cords, and bring him up out of the pit: and Jeremiah dwelt in the enclosure of the prison.
{38:14} And king Zedekiah will send and take Jeremiah the prophet to him to the third entrance which was in the house of Jehovah; and the king will say to Jeremiah, I ask thee a word; thou shalt not hide a word from me.
{38:15} And Jeremiah will say to Zedekiah, If I shall announce to thee, killing, wilt thou not put me to death? and if I shall counsel thee, thou wilt not hear to me?
{38:16} And king Zedekiah will swear to Jeremiah in secret, saying, Jehovah lives who made to us this soul, if I shall put thee to death, and if I shall give thee into the hand of these men who are seeking thy soul.
{38:17} And Jeremiah will say to Zedekiah, Thus said Jehovah, God of armies, God of Israel, If going forth, thou wilt go forth to the chiefs of the king of Babel, and thy soul lived, and this city shall not be burnt with fire; and thou livedst and thy house:
{38:18} And if thou wilt not go forth to the chiefs of the king of Babel, and this city was given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they burnt it with fire, and thou shalt not escape from their hand.
{38:19} And king Zedekiah will say to Jeremiah, I fear the Jews who fell to the Chaldeans, lest they shall give me into their hand and they illtreated me.
{38:20} And Jeremiah will say, They shall not give. Hear, now, to the voice of Jehovah for which I speak to thee: and it shall be well to thee, and thy soul shall live.
{38:21} And if thou refuse to go forth, this the word which Jehovah caused me to see:
{38:22} And behold, all the women which were left in the house of the king of Judah being brought forth to the chiefs of the king of Babel, and they say, The men of thy peace enticed thee, and they prevailed against thee: they sank thy foot in mire, they turned away back.
{38:23} And all thy women and all thy sons being brought forth to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape from their hand, for thou shalt be seized by the hand of the king of Babel: and thou shalt burn this city with fire.
{38:24} And Zedekiah will say to Jeremiah, No man shall know of these words, and thou shalt not die.
{38:25} And if the chiefs shall hear that I spake with thee, and they came to thee, and said to thee, Announce now to us what thou spakest to the king; thou shalt not hide from us, and we will not put thee to death; and what said the king to thee:
{38:26} And say thou to them, I cause my supplication to fall before the king, not to turn me back to the house of Jonathan, to die there.
{38:27} And all the chiefs will come to Jeremiah, and they will ask him: and he will announce to them according to all these words which the king commanded. And they will be silent from him, for the word was not heard.
{38:28} And Jeremiah dwelt in the enclosure of the prison even to the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was when Jerusalem was taken.
{39:1} In the ninth year to Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and all his army, against Jerusalem, and they pressed upon her.
{39:2} In the eleventh year to Zedekiah, in the fourth month, in the ninth to the month, the city was broken.
{39:3} And all the chiefs of the king of Babel will come and sit in the middle gate, Nergal-Sarezer, Samgar-Nebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal-Sharezer, Rab-Mag, and all the remainder of the chiefs of the king of Babel.
{39:4} And it will be as Zedekiah king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, and they will flee and go forth at night from the city the way of the king's garden, in the gate between the two walls: and he will go forth the way of the desert.
{39:5} And the army of the Chaldeans will pursue after them, and they will overtake Zedekiah in the sterile region of Jericho, and they will take him and bring him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, to Riblah in the hand of Hamath, and he will speak with him judgments.
{39:6} And the king of Babel will slaughter the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: and all the nobles of Judah the king of Babel slaughtered.
{39:7} And he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah, and he will bind him with fetters of brass to bring him to Babel.
{39:8} And the Chaldeans burnt the house of the king, and the house of the people, with fire, and they broke the walls of Jerusalem.
{39:9} And the remainder of the people being left in the city, and those falling away which fell to him, and the remainder of the people being left, Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks, carried away captive to Babel.
{39:10} And from the weak people which to them was nothing, Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks left in the land of Judah, and he will give to them vineyards and fields in that day.
{39:11} And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel will command concerning Jeremiah by the hand of Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks, saying,
{39:12} Take him and set thine eyes upon him, and thou shalt do to him nothing evil; but as he shall speak to thee thus do to him.
{39:13} And Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks will send, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, Nergal-Sharezer, Rab-Mag, and all the chiefs of the king of Babel;
{39:14} And they will send and take Jeremiah from the enclosure of the prison and they will give him to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, to carry him forth to the house: and he will dwell in the midst of the people.
{39:15} And to Jeremiah was the word of Jehovah in his being shut up in the enclosure of the prison, saying,
{39:16} Go and say to the king's servant the Cushite, saying, Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Behold me bringing my words to this city for evil and not for good; and they were in that day before thee.
{39:17} And I delivered thee in that day, says Jehovah: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men thou wilt be afraid of their face.
{39:18} For escaping, I will let thee escape, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, and thy soul was to thee for booty: for thou didst trust in me, says Jehovah.
{40:1} The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah after Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks sent him from Ramah, in his taking him, he being bound in manacles in the midst of all the captivity of Jerusalem and Judah, being carried away captive to Babel.
{40:2} And the chief of the cooks will take to Jeremiah and say to him, Jehovah thy God spake this evil against this place.
{40:3} And Jehovah will bring and do as he spake: because ye sinned against Jehovah, and ye heard not to his voice, and this word was to you.
{40:4} And now behold I loosed thee this day from the manacles which were upon thy hand. If good in thine eyes to go with me to Babel, come; and I will set mine eye upon thee: and if evil in thine eyes to go with me to Babel, desist: see all the land before thee: if good and for the straight in thine eyes to go, go.
{40:5} And while he will not turn back, And turn back to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babel appointed over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him in the midst of the people: or to all the straight in thine eyes to go, go. And the chief of the cooks: will give to him a portion and a gift, and he will send him away.
{40:6} And Jeremiah will go to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, to Mizpeh, and he will dwell with him in the midst of the people being left in the land.
{40:7} And all the chiefs of the armies which were in the field, they and their men will hear, for the king of Babel appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over the land, and that he committed to him the men and the women and children and the poor of the land from whom they were not carried away captive to Babel.
{40:8} And they will come to Gedaliah to Mizpeh, and Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan, sons of Kareah, and Seraiah, son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maachathite, they and their men.
{40:9} And Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, will swear to them and to their men, saying, Ye shall not fear serving the Chaldeans: dwell in the land and serve the king of Babel, and it shall be well to you.
{40:10} And I, behold me dwelling in Mizpeh to stand before the Chaldeans who will come to us: and ye, gather ye Wine, and the fruit harvest, and oil, and put in your vessels, and dwell in your cities which ye took.
{40:11} And also all the Jews which are in Moab, and among the sons of Ammon, and in Edom, and in the lands, heard that the king of Babel gave a remnant to Judah, and that he appointed over them Gedaliah son of Alukam, son of Shaphan.
{40:12} And all the Jews from all the places where they were thrust out there will turn back, and they will come to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpeh, and they will gather wine and the fruit harvest exceeding much.
{40:13} Johanan son of Kareah, and all the chiefs of the armies which were in the field came to Gedaliah to Mizpeh.
{40:14} And they will say to him, Knowing, wilt thou know that Baalis, king of the sons of Ammon sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to strike thee in soul? And Gedaliah son of Ahikam believed not in them.
{40:15} And Johanan son of Kareah said to Gedaliah in Mizpeh, in secret, saying, I will go now and strike Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know: wherefore shall he strike the soul, and all the Jews gathered to thee be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?
{40:16} And Gedaliah son of Ahikam will say to Johanan son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this word, for thou speakest falsehood concerning Ishmael.
{41:1} And it will be in the seventh month, came Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, from the seed of the kingdom, and the chiefs of the king, and ten men with him, to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, to Mizpeh, and there will they eat bread together in Mizpeh.
{41:2} And Ishmael son of Nethaniah will rise, and the ten men which were with him, and they will strike Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, with the sword, and he will kill him whom the king of Babel appointed over the land.
{41:3} And all the Jews which were with him with Gedaliah in Mizpeh, and the Chaldeans which were found there with the men of war, Ishmael smote.
{41:4} And it will be in the second day of killing Gedaliah, and not a man knew.
{41:5} And men will come from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Shomeron, eighty men, shaving the beard, and their garments rent, and cutting themselves, and a gift and frankincense in their hand, to bring to the house of Jehovah.
{41:6} And Ishmael son of Nethaniah came forth to meet them from Mizpeh; he went going and weeping: and it will be as he fell in with them, and he will say to them, Come to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam.
{41:7} And it will be as they came to the midst of the city, Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, will slaughter them to the midst of the pit, he and the men that were with him.
{41:8} And ten men were found among them, and they will say to Ishmael, Thou shalt not slay us: for there is to us treasures in the field, wheat and barley and oil and honey. And he will desist and kill them not in the midst of their brethren.
{41:9} And the pit where Ishmael cast there all the corpses of the men whom he struck by the hand of Gedaliah was that which king Asa made from the face of Baasha king of Israel: Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the wounded.
{41:10} And Ishmael will carry away captive all the remnant of the people which were in Mizpeh, the king's daughters and all the people being left in Mizpeh, which Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks committed to Gedaliah son of Ahikam: and Ishmael son of Nethaniah will carry them captive, and he will depart to pass over to the sons of Ammon.
{41:11} And Johanan son of Kareah will hear, and all the chiefs of the armies which were with him, all the evil which Ishmael son of Nethaniah did.
{41:12} And they will take all the men and go to fight with Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and they will find him at the many waters which are in the hill.
{41:13} And it will be as all the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah, and all the chiefs of the army which are with him, they will rejoice.
{41:14} And all the people which Ishmael carried away captive from Mizpeh will turn about and turn back and go to Johanan son of Kareah.
{41:15} And Ishmael son of Nethaniah escaped with eight men from the face of Johanan, and he went to the sons of Ammon.
{41:16} And Johanan son of Kareah will take, and all the captains of the armies which were with him, all the remnant whom he turned back from Ishmael son of Nethaniah from Mizpeh, after he struck Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the strong men of war, and the women and children, and the eunuchs which he turned back from the hill.
{41:17} And they will go and dwell in the habitation of Chimham, which is near the house of bread, to go to come into Egypt,
{41:18} From the face of the Chaldean: for they were afraid from their face, because Ishmael son of Nethaniah, struck Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babel appointed over the land.
{42:1} And all the chiefs of the armies will draw near, and Johanan son of Kareah, and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the small even to the great.
{42:2} And they will say to Jeremiah the prophet, Now shall our supplication fall before thee, and pray thou for us to Jehovah thy God, for all this remnant; for we were left few from many as thine eyes see us.
{42:3} And Jehovah thy God will announce to us the way which we shall go in it, and the word which we shall do.
{42:4} And Jeremiah the prophet will say to them, I heard; behold me praying to Jehovah your God according to your words; and it was all the word that Jehovah shall answer you I will announce to you; I will not withhold a word from you.
{42:5} And they said to Jeremiah, Jehovah will be with us for a witness of truth and faithful, if not according to all the words which Jehovah thy God will send thee to us, thus will we do.
{42:6} If good, and if evil, we will hear to the voice of Jehovah our God which we sent thee to him; so that it shall be well to us, for we will hear to the voice of Jehovah our God.
{42:7} And it will be from the end of ten days, and the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah.
{42:8} And he will call to Johanan son of Kareah, and to all the chiefs of the armies which were with him, and to all the people, from small even to great,
{42:9} And he will say to them, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, whom ye sent me to him for your supplication to fall before him.
{42:10} If dwelling, ye will dwell in this land, and I built you, and I will not pull down, and I planted you, and I will not pluck up: for I grieved for the evil which I did to you.
{42:11} Ye shall not fear from the face of the king of Babel whom ye fear; from his face ye shall not fear, says Jehovah: for I am with you to save you and to deliver you out of his hand.
{42:12} And I will give mercies to you, and he compassionated you, and turned you back to your land.
{42:13} And if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, not hearing to the voice of Jehovah your God,
{42:14} Saying, No; for we will go to the land of Egypt where we shall not see war, and we shall not hear the voice of the trumpet, and for bread we shall not hunger: and there will we dwell.
{42:15} And now for this, hear the word of Jehovah, ye remnant of Judah: Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, If setting, ye shall set your faces to go to Egypt, and ye went to sojourn there;
{42:16} And it was the sword which ye were afraid of it, there it shall overtake you in the land of Egypt, and the famine which ye feared from it, shall cleave after you there in Egypt, and there shall ye die.
{42:17} And it shall be all the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to sojourn there shall die with the sword, and with famine, and with death: and there shall not be to them fleeing or escaping from the face of the evil which I bring upon them.
{42:18} For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, as mine anger was poured out, and my wrath upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured out upon you in your going to Egypt: and ye were for a curse and for an astonishment and for reviling, and for reproach; and ye shall no more see this place.
{42:19} Jehovah spake concerning you, Ye remnant of Judah, ye shall not go to Egypt: knowing, ye shall know, for I testified against you this day.
{42:20} For ye erred in your souls when ye sent me to Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us to Jehovah our God; and according to all Jehovah will say, so announce to us, and we will do.
{42:21} And I will announce to you this day; and ye heard not to the voice of Jehovah your God, and to all which he sent me to you.
{42:22} And now knowing, ye shall know that by sword and by famine and by death ye shall die in the place where ye desired to go to sojourn there.
{43:1} And it will be as Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all the words of Jehovah their God, which Jehovah their God sent him to them all these words,
{43:2} And Azariah son of Hoshaiah will say, and Johanan son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying to Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsehood: Jehovah our God sent thee not to say, Ye shall not go to Egypt to sojourn there:
{43:3} For Baruch son of Neriah entices thee against us to give us into the hand of the Chaldeans, to kill us and carry us away captive to Babel.
{43:4} And Johanan son of Kareah heard not, and all the chiefs of the armies, and all the people, to the voice of Jehovah, to dwell in the land of Judah.
{43:5} And Johanan son of Kareah will take, and all the chiefs of the armies, all the remnant of Judah who turned back from all the nations, where they were thrust away there to sojourn in the land of Judah;
{43:6} Men and women and children, and the king's daughters, and every soul which Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch, son of Neriah.
{43:7} And they will come to the land of Egypt: for they heard not to the voice of Jehovah, and they will come even to Tahpanhes.
{43:8} And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
{43:9} Take in thy hand great stones, and hide them in the mortar in the brick kiln, which is in the entrance of the house of Pharaoh in Tahpanhes, before the eyes of the men of Judah,
{43:10} And say to them, Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Behold me sending and I took Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, my servant, and I set his throne from above these stones which I hid; and he spread his tapestry upon them.
{43:11} And coming and smiting the land of Egypt, whom for death to death, and whom for captivity to captivity, and whom for the sword to the sword.
{43:12} And I kindled a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and he burnt them and carried them away captive: and he covered himself with the land of Egypt as the shepherd will cover himself with his garment; and he will go forth from thence in peace.
{43:13} And he brake the pillars of the house of the sun which is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the Gods of Egypt he shall burn in fire.
{44:1} The word which was to Jeremiah to all the Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt, dwelling in the tower, and in Tahpanhes, and Noph, and in the land of Pathros, saying,
{44:2} Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Ye saw all the evil which I brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and behold them a Waste this day, and none dwelling in them;
{44:3} From the face of their evil which they did to irritate me, going to burn incense to serve other gods whom they knew not, they, and your fathers.
{44:4} And I will send to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending, saying, Now ye shall not do this abomination which I hated.
{44:5} And they heard not and inclined not their ear to turn back from their evil, not to burn incense to other gods.
{44:6} And my wrath will be poured out, and mine anger, and it will be kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they shall be for a waste, for a desolation as this day.
{44:7} And now, thus said Jehovah, God of armies, God of Israel: Wherefore ye do great evil to your souls to cut off to you man and woman and child and suckling from the midst of Judah, not to leave a remnant to you;
{44:8} For your irritating me with the works of your hands, to burn incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where ye go to sojourn there, to cut off to you, and for your being for a curse and for a reproach in all the nations of the earth.
{44:9} Forgat ye the evil of your fathers, and the evil of the kings of Judah, and the evil of their wives, and your evil, and the evil of your wives, which they did in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
{44:10} And they were not humbled even to this day, and they feared not and they went not in my instructions and in my laws which I gave before you and before your fathers.
{44:11} For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Behold me setting my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.
{44:12} And I took the remainder of Judah, that set their faces to go to the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they were all consumed in the land of Egypt; they shall fall by the sword and by famine: they shall be consumed from small and even to great, by the sword and by famine: they shall die, and they were for an oath, and for a, desolation, and for a curse, and for a reproach.
{44:13} And I reviewed over those dwelling in the land of Egypt, as I reviewed over Jerusalem, by the sword, by famine and by death.
{44:14} And there shall not be escaping or fleeing to the remnant of Judah going to sojourn there in the land of Egypt, to turn back to the land of Judah, which they lift up their soul to turn back to dwell there: for they shall not turn back but the escaped.
{44:15} And they will answer Jeremiah, all the men knowing that their wives burn incense to other gods, and all the women standing, a great convocation, and all the people dwelling in the land of Egypt in Pathros, saying,
{44:16} The word which thou spakest to us in the name of Jehovah, we hear not to thee.
{44:17} But doing, we will do all the word which went forth from our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, to pour out libations to her, as we did, we and our fathers, our kings and our chiefs in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: and we shall be filled with bread, and we shall be well, and see not evil.
{44:18} From then we ceased to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out libations to her, we wanted all things, and were consumed by sword and by famine.
{44:19} And when we burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and pour out libations to her, did we without our men make cakes to her, to serve her, and pour out libations to her?
{44:20} And Jeremiah will say to all the people, to the men and to the women, and to all the people answering him the word, saying,
{44:21} The incense which ye burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your chiefs, and the people of the land, did not Jehovah remember them, and it will come up upon his heart?
{44:22} And Jehovah shall no more be able to lift up from the face of the evil of your doings from the face of the abominations which ye did; and your land shall be for a waste, and for an astonishment, and for a curse, without any inhabitant, as this day.
{44:23} From the face of what ye burned incense, and what ye sinned against Jehovah, and ye heard not to the voice of Jehovah, and in his instructions and in his laws and in his testimonies ye went not; for this, this evil befell you as this day.
{44:24} And Jeremiah will say to all the people, and to all the women, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, all, Judah who are in the land of Egypt:
{44:25} Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, saying, Ye and your wives, and ye will speak with your mouth, and with your hands ye filled up; saying, Doing, we will do our vows which we vowed, to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out libations to her: setting up, ye will set up your vows, and doing, ye will do your vows.
{44:26} For this, hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah dwelling in the land of Egypt: Behold, I sware by my great name, said Jehovah, if my name shall yet be called by the mouth of all the men of Judah, saying, The Lord Jehovah lives, in all the land of Egypt.
{44:27} Behold me watching over them for evil and not for good: and they were consumed, all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt, by sword and by famine, even till their finishing.
{44:28} And escaping the sword there shall turn back from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, men of number, and all the remnant of Judah going to the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall be raised up from me and from them.
{44:29} And this a sign to you, says Jehovah, that I review upon you in this place, so that ye shall know that raising up, I will raise up my word against you for evil.
{44:30} Thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving Pharaoh-Hophra, king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies, seeking his soul; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, his enemy, and seeking his soul.
{45:1} The word which Jeremiah the prophet spake to Baruch, son of Neriah, in his writing these words up on the book from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year to Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
{45:2} Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, to thee, O Baruch;
{45:3} Thou saidst, Wo to me now! for Jehovah added grief upon my pain; I was weary in my sighing, and I found not rest.
{45:4} Thus shalt thou say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Behold, what I built I pulled down, and what I planted I plucked up, and all this land.
{45:5} And thou, wilt thou seek great things to thyself? thou shalt not seek: for behold me bringing evil upon all flesh, says Jehovah: and I gave to thee thy soul for a booty to all the places where thou shalt go there.
{46:1} The word of Jehovah which was to Jeremiah the prophet against the nations;
{46:2} To Egypt against the army of Pharaoh-Necho, king of Egypt, that was upon the river Phrath in Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel smote in the fourth year to Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah.
{46:3} Prepare the covering and the shield, and approach to the war.
{46:4} Harness the horses, and come up, ye horsemen, and stand in the helmets; polish the spears, and put on the coats of mail.
{46:5} Wherefore did I see them terrified, drawing back behind? and their strong ones shall be broken, and they fled a flight, and they turned not: fear being round about, says Jehovah.
{46:6} The swift shall not flee away, and the strong shall not escape: to the north upon the hand of the river Phrath they stumbled and fell.
{46:7} Who this as a river he shall come up, as the rivers his waters shall be moved?
{46:8} Egypt as a river will come up, and as rivers the waters will be moved; and he will say, I will go up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and those dwelling in it.
{46:9} Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and the strong ones shall come forth: Cush and Phut seizing the shield; and the Ludims, bending the bow.
{46:10} And that the day to the Lord Jehovah of armies, a day of vengeance to be avenged of his adversaries: and the sword consumed and was satiated, and drunk their blood to the full; for a sacrifice to the Lord Jehovah of armies in the land of the north by the river Phrath.
{46:11} Go up to Gilead, and take balsam, O virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou bring up many healings; none to thee.
{46:12} The nations heard thy shame, and thy outcry filled the land: for the strong stumbled against the strong; they two fell together.
{46:13} The word which Jehovah spake to Jeremiah the prophet, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel to come to strike the land of Egypt.
{46:14} Announce ye in Egypt, and cause to be heard in the tower, and cause to be heard in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand, and prepare for thyself; for the sword consumed round about thee.
{46:15} Wherefore were thy powerful cast down, not to stand? for Jehovah thrust them away.
{46:16} He multiplied the faltering, also a man fell to his neighbor: and they will say, Arise, and we will turn back to our people, and to the land of our birth, from the face of the oppressing sword.
{46:17} They called there, Pharaoh king of Egypt an uproar; he passed by the appointment.
{46:18} I live, says the King, Jehovah of armies his name, For as Tabor in the mountains, and as Carmel in the sea, he shall come.
{46:19} Make to thee instruments of captivity, thou daughter dwelling in Egypt: for Noph shall be for a waste and desolate from not being inhabited.
{46:20} Egypt a heifer, fair of mouth; destruction came; from the north it came.
{46:21} Also her hirelings in the midst of her as calves of the stall; for also they turned, they fled together: they stood not, for the day of their calamity came upon them, the time of their reviewing.
{46:22} Her voice shall go as the serpent; for with an army in the sand they shall go, and with axes they came to her, as they hewing wood.
{46:23} They cut down her forest, says Jehovah, for it shall not be searched out, for they were many above the locust, and no number to them.
{46:24} The daughter of Egypt was ashamed; she was given into the hand of the people of the north.
{46:25} Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, said, Behold me reviewing for the multitude of No, and upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt, and upon her gods, and upon her kings; and upon Pharaoh and upon those trusting in him:
{46:26} And I gave them into the hand of those seeking their souls, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babel, and into the hand of his servants: and after this she shall be inhabited as the days of old, says Jehovah.
{46:27} And thou shalt not fear, O my servant Jacob, and thou shalt not be terrified, O Israel: for behold me saving thee from far off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob turned back, and rested and was quiet, and none making afraid.
{46:28} Thou shalt not fear, O my servant Jacob, says Jehovah: for I am with thee; for I will make a completion among all nations where I thrust thee away there: and I will not make a completion with thee, and I will correct thee for judgment; and acquitting, I will not let thee go unpunished.
{47:1} The word of Jehovah which was to Jeremiah the prophet, against the rovers, before Pharaoh will smite Gaza.
{47:2} Thus said Jehovah, Behold, waters coming up from the north, and they were for an overflowing torrent, and they shall overflow the land, and its fulness; the city and those dwelling in it: and the men cried out, and all inhabiting the land wailed.
{47:3} From the voice of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, from the bounding of his chariot, the noise of his wheels, the fathers turned not back to the sons from slackness of hands;
{47:4} For the day came to lay waste all the rovers, to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every one left of help: for Jehovah laid waste the rovers, the remnant of the island of Caphtor.
{47:5} Baldness came upon Gaza; Ashkelon was destroyed, the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?
{47:6} Alas, thou sword of Jehovah, till when wilt thou rest? be gathered to thy sheath; be quiet and be still.
{47:7} How shalt thou rest, and Jehovah commanded to it against Ashkelon, and against the sea-shore? there he confirmed it.
{48:1} Against Moab thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Wo to Nebo for it was laid waste: Kiriathaim was ashamed and taken: Misgab was ashamed and terrified.
{48:2} No more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they purposed evil against it; come, and we will cut it off from a nation. Thou also shalt be destroyed, O Madmen; the sword shall go after thee.
{48:3} A voice of a cry from Horonaim, laying waste, and great breaking.
{48:4} Moab was broken; her youths caused a cry to be heard.
{48:5} For the going up of Luhith weeping shall go up with weeping; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies heard a cry of breaking.
{48:6} Flee, save your souls, and ye shall be as ruins in the desert.
{48:7} For because of thy boasting in thy works and in thy treasures, also thou shalt be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity, his priests and his chiefs together.
{48:8} And he laying waste shall come up on every city, and no city shall escape: and the valley was destroyed, and straightness was laid waste, as said Jehovah.
{48:9} Ye shall give a wing to Moab, that fleeing she shall go forth: for her cities shall be for a desolation, from none dwelling in them.
{48:10} Cursed he doing the work of Jehovah slothfully, and cursed he withholding his sword from blood.
{48:11} Moab was tranquil from his youth, and he rested upon his lees, he was not poured out from vessel to vessel, and he went not into captivity: for this his taste stood in him, and his breath was not changed.
{48:12} For this, behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I sent to him those turning aside, and they turned aside, and they will empty his vessels and break his bottles.
{48:13} And Moab was ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of the house of God their confidence.
{48:14} How shall ye say, We are mighty and men of strength for war?
{48:15} Moab was laid waste, and she went up from her cities, and the choice of his young men went down to the slaughter, says the King, Jehovah of armies, his name.
{48:16} The calamity of Moab drew near, to come, and his evil hastened greatly.
{48:17} All ye about him, bewail for him; and all ye knowing his name, say, How was the strong rod broken, the beautiful shoot!
{48:18} Come down from thy glory, sit in thirst, thou daughter dwelling in Dibon; for he laying Moab waste came up upon thee, destroying thy fortress.
{48:19} Stand to the way and look about, thou inhabiting Aroer; ask him fleeing, and her escaping, say, What was it?
{48:20} Moab was ashamed; for she was broken down: wail, ye, and cry; announce in Arnon that Moab was laid waste,
{48:21} And judgment came to the land of straightness; to Holon, and to Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,
{48:22} And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon the house of cakes of figs,
{48:23} And upon the city of forests, and upon the house of the weaned, and upon the house of habitation,
{48:24} And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far off and near.
{48:25} The horn of Moab was cut off, and his arm was broken, says Jehovah.
{48:26} Make him drunk; for he was magnified against Jehovah, and Moab vomited forth in his vomit, and he was for a derision.
{48:27} And if Israel was not a derision to thee? if he was found among thieves? for after thy speaking of him thou wilt move to and fro.
{48:28} Those inhabiting Moab, forsook the cities and dwelt in the rock, and they were as the dove, she will nest in the regions beyond the mouth of the pit.
{48:29} We heard the pride of Moab; he was greatly lifted up; his haughtiness and his pride, and his lifting up, and the elation of his heart.
{48:30} I knew, says Jehovah, his wrath; and not thus; his empty talks did not so.
{48:31} For this I will wait for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; it shall grieve for the men of Kirheres.
{48:32} With the weeping of Jazer, I will weep for thee, O vine of Sibmah: thy tendrils passed over the sea, even to the sea of Jazer they reached: he laying waste fell upon thy fruit harvest, and upon thy vintage.
{48:33} And joy and gladness was taken away from Carmel, and from the land of Moab; and I caused wine to cease from the wine-vats: they shall not tread the shout of joy; the shout of joy, not the shout of joy.
{48:34} From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealah, even to Jahaz, they gave their voice from Zoar even to Horonaim, a heifer of the third year: for also the waters of Nimrim shall be for desolations.
{48:35} And I caused to cease to shout, says Jehovah, him bringing up to the height, and him burning incense to his gods.
{48:36} For this, my heart shall sound for Moab as pipes, and my heart shall sound for the men of Kirheres as pipes: for the riches he made perished.
{48:37} For every head bald, and every beard shaved: upon all hands cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.
{48:38} Upon all the roof of Moab, and in the streets altogether lamentation: for I brake Moab as a vessel, no delight in it, says Jehovah.
{48:39} How was it broken they wailed; how did Moab turn back the neck with shame and Moab was for derision and for terror to all round about him.
{48:40} For thus said Jehovah: Behold, as an eagle he shall fly, and he spread his wings to Moab.
{48:41} Kerioth was taken, and the fastnesses were seized, and the heart of the strong ones of Moab in that day was as the heart of a woman being distressed.
{48:42} And Moab was destroyed from a people, for he was magnified against Jehovah.
{48:43} Fear, and the pit and the snare upon thee, thou inhabiting Moab, says Jehovah.
{48:44} He fleeing from the face of fear shall fall into the pit; and he coming up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, upon Moab, the years of their reviewing, says Jehovah.
{48:45} They fleeing from the power stood in the shadow of Heshbon: for a fire will come forth from Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall consume, the corners of Moab and the crown of the sons of noise.
{48:46} Wo to thee, O Moab! The people of Chemosh perished: for thy sons were taken into captivity, and thy daughters into captivity.
{48:47} And I turned back the captivity of Moab in the latter days, says Jehovah. Even to this the judgment of Moab.
{49:1} To the sons of Ammon, thus said Jehovah: Is there no sons to Israel? none inheriting to him? Wherefore did their king inherit Gad, and his people dwelt in his cities?
{49:2} For this, behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I caused to be heard the alarm of war to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon; and it was for a heap of desolation, and her daughters shall be burned with fire; and Israel shall inherit those inheriting him, says Jehovah.
{49:3} Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai was laid waste: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird yourselves with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro in the walled places; for their king shall go into captivity, his priests and his chiefs together.
{49:4} Wherefore wilt thou boast in the valleys, thy valley flowing away, O daughter turning away? trusting in her treasures, Who shall come to me?
{49:5} Behold me bringing fear upon thee, says the Lord Jehovah of armies, from all round about thee; and ye were thrust away every man to his face, and none gathering to him wandering.
{49:6} And after this I will turn back the captivity of the sons of Ammon, says Jehovah.
{49:7} To Edom, thus said Jehovah of armies, Is wisdom no more in Teman? did counsel perish from the discerning? was their wisdom poured out?
{49:8} Flee ye, turn back, make deep to dwell, ye dwelling in Dedan; for I brought the calamity of Esau upon him, the time of his reviewing.
{49:9} If the vintages came to thee will they not leave gleanings? if thieves by night, they destroyed their sufficiency.
{49:10} For I made Esau naked, I uncovered his secret places, he shall not be able to hide: his seed was laid waste, and his brethren and his neighbors, and he is not.
{49:11} Leave thine orphans, I will preserve alive, and thy widows shall trust upon me.
{49:12} For thus said Jehovah: Behold, whose judgment was not to drink the cup, drinking, they will drink; and art thou he being acquitted, shalt thou be unpunished? thou shalt not be unpunished, for drinking, thou shalt drink.
{49:13} For by myself did I swear, says Jehovah, that Bozrah shall be for a desolation, for a reproach, and for a waste, and for a curse; and all her cities shall be for wastes forever.
{49:14} I heard a report from Jehovah, and a messenger sent to the nations: Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up for war.
{49:15} For behold, I gave thee small among the nations, despised among men.
{49:16} Thy terror deceived thee, the pride of thy heart, thou dwelling in the asylums of the rock, holding the height of the hill: if thou shalt make thy nest high as the eagle, from thence will I bring thee down, says Jehovah.
{49:17} And Edom was for a desolation: all passing over her shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all her blows.
{49:18} As the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and her neighbors, said Jehovah, a man shall not dwell there, and the son of man shall not sojourn in her.
{49:19} Behold, as the lion he shall come up from the excellency of Jordan against the habitation of strength: for I will wink, I will cause him to run from her: and who the chosen I shall appoint to her? for who like me? and who shall testify for me? and who this shepherd which shall stand before me?
{49:20} For this, hear ye the counsel of Jehovah which he counseled against Edom: and his purposes which he purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: If not the least of the flock will drag them out: if he shall not make their habitation destitute upon them.
{49:21} From the voice of their falling the earth trembled, at the cry its voice was heard in the sea of sedge.
{49:22} Behold, as the eagle he shall come up and fly and spread his wings over Bozrah, and the heart of the strong of Edom was in that day as the heart of a woman being distressed.
{49:23} To Damascus: Hamath was ashamed, and Arpad: for they heard the evil report: they melted; fear upon the sea; it will not be able to rest.
{49:24} Damascus was relaxed, she turned back to flee, and terror laid hold of her, and pain and sorrows seized her, as she bringing forth.
{49:25} How was the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!
{49:26} For this her young men shall fall in her street, and all the men of war shall be destroyed in that day, says Jehovah of armies.
{49:27} And I will kindle a fire in the walls of Damascus, and it consumed the palaces of the son of Hadad.
{49:28} To Kedar, and to the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel struck, thus said Jehovah: Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and lay waste the sons of the east.
{49:29} Their tents and their flocks they shall take away: their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels, shall they lift up for themselves; and they called to them, Fear from round about.
{49:30} Flee, move yourselves greatly, make deep to dwell, ye inhabitants of Hazor, says Jehovah; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel counseled counsel against you, and purposed a purpose against you.
{49:31} Arise, go ye up to the nation at rest, dwelling with confidence, says Jehovah; no gates and no bars to it; they shall dwell alone.
{49:32} And their camels were for plunder, and the multitude of their cattle for a spoil: and I scattered them to every wind cut off to the corner; and from all its regions beyond I will bring their calamity, says Jehovah.
{49:33} And Hazor was for a dwelling of jackals, a desolation even to forever: a man shall not dwell there, and the son of man shall not sojourn in it.
{49:34} The word of Jehovah which was to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the kingdom of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,
{49:35} Thus said Jehovah of armies, Behold me breaking the bow of Elam the beginning of their strength.
{49:36} And I brought upon Elam the four winds from the four ends of the heavens, and I scattered them to all these winds; and there shall not be a nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come there.
{49:37} And I confounded Elam before their enemies, and before them seeking their soul: and I brought evil upon them, the burning of mine anger, says Jehovah; and I sent after them the sword even till I finished them.
{49:38} And I set my throne in Elam, and I destroyed from thence the king and the chiefs, says Jehovah.
{49:39} And it was in the last days I will turn back the captivity of Elam, says Jehovah.
{50:1} The word that Jehovah spake against Babel, against the land of the Chaldeans, by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet.
{50:2} Announce ye in the nations, and cause to be heard, and lift up a signal; cause to be heard, ye shall not hide: say, Babel was taken, Bel was ashamed, Merodach was broken; her images were ashamed, her blocks were broken.
{50:3} For a nation came up from the north against her; it shall set her land for a desolation, and none shall be dwelling in her: from man and even to beast they moved, and they went.
{50:4} In those days and in that time, says Jehovah, the sons of Israel shall come, they and the sons of Judah together, going, and they wept: they shall go and shall seek Jehovah their God.
{50:5} To Zion shall they ask the way, thither their faces: Come ye, and we will join ourselves to Jehovah an eternal covenant; it shall not be forgotten.
{50:6} My people were lost sheep: their shepherds caused them to wander, they turned them away in the mountains: they went from mountain to hill, they forgot their place to lie down.
{50:7} All finding them consumed them: and their adversaries said, We shall not transgress, for they sinned against Jehovah the habitation of justice, and the hope of their fathers, Jehovah.
{50:8} Move from the midst of Babel, and from the land of the Chaldeans; come forth and be ye as the he goats before the flock.
{50:9} For behold I raise up and bring up against Babel a convocation of great nations from the land of the north: and they arranged against her; from thence she shall be taken: his arrow as of a strong destroyer shall not turn back in vain.
{50:10} And Chaldea was for a spoil: all spoiling her shall be satisfied, says Jehovah.
{50:11} Because thou wilt be glad, because thou wilt exult, ye plundering mine inheritance, because thou wilt show off proudly as a heifer at grass, and thou wilt neigh as the strong ones;
{50:12} Your mother was greatly ashamed; she bearing you was put to shame: behold the last of the nations a desert, dryness and a sterile region.
{50:13} From the wrath of Jehovah she shall not be inhabited, and it was wholly a desolation: every one passing over Babel shall be astonished and shall hiss at all her blows.
{50:14} Arrange yourselves against Babel round about: all ye bending the bow, cast at her, ye shall not spare to the arrow, for she sinned against Jehovah.
{50:15} Shout against her round about: she gave her hand: her supports fell, her walls were pulled down: for it is the vengeance of Jehovah: avenge ye upon her; as she did, do ye to her.
{50:16} Cut off him sowing from Babel, and him holding the sickle in time of harvest: from the face of the Grecian sword they shall turn a man to his people, and they shall flee a man to his land.
{50:17} Israel a scattered sheep; the lions thrust away: first the king of Assur consumed him; and the last this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel bound him fast.
{50:18} For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Behold me reviewing for the king of Babel, and for his land, as I reviewed to the king of Assur.
{50:19} And I turned back Israel to his habitation, and he fed in Carmel and Bashan; and upon mount Ephraim and Gilead shall his soul be satisfied.
{50:20} In those days and in that time, says Jehovah, he will seek the iniquity of Israel, and not any; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I shall forgive to whom I shall leave.
{50:21} Go up against the land of double rebellion, against her, and against the inhabitants of Pekod, laying waste and destroying after them, says Jehovah; and do according to all which I commanded thee.
{50:22} The voice of war in the land, and a great breaking.
{50:23} How was the hammer of all the earth cut off, and it will be broken! How was Babel for a desolation among the nations!
{50:24} I laid snares for thee and also thou wert taken, O Babel, and thou knewest not: thou wert found and thou wert also taken, for thou didst contend against Jehovah.
{50:25} Jehovah opened his treasure, and he will bring forth the vessels of his anger: for this the work to the Lord Jehovah of armies in the land of the Chaldeans.
{50:26} Come ye against her from the extremity; open her store-houses: cast her up as heaps and exterminate her: there shall be no remnant to her.
{50:27} Lay waste all her bullocks; come down to the slaughter: wo to them! for their day came, the time of their reviewing.
{50:28} The voice of those fleeing and escaping out of the land of Babel, to announce in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance of his temple.
{50:29} Cause ye many to be heard against Babel: all ye bending the bow encamp against her round about; there shall be no escaping: requite her according to her work; according to all she did, do to her: for she acted proudly against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel.
{50:30} For this her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of her war shall be destroyed in that day, says Jehovah.
{50:31} Behold me against thee, O pride, says the Lord Jehovah of armies: for thy day came, the time I reviewed thee.
{50:32} And pride stumbled and fell, and none lifting up to it: and I kindled a fire in his cities and it shall consume all round about him.
{50:33} Thus said Jehovah of armies: the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah being oppressed together: and all taking them captive held upon them; they refused to send them away.
{50:34} He redeeming them is strong; Jehovah of armies, his name: pleading, he will plead their cause, so that he caused the land to rest, and caused disquiet to the inhabitants of Babel.
{50:35} A sword upon the Chaldeans, says Jehovah, and to the inhabitants of Babel and to her chiefs, and to her wise.
{50:36} A sword against the liars; and they were foolish: a sword against her strong ones, and they were broken.
{50:37} A sword against his horses and against his chariots, and against all the mixture which is in her midst; and they were for women: a sword against her treasures, and they were plundered.
{50:38} A sword upon her waters, and they shall be dried up: for it is a land of carved images, and in their terrors they will be foolish.
{50:39} For this the inhabitans of the deserts shall dwell with the islands, and the daughters of the ostrich shall dwell in her: and it shall be no more inhabited forever; and she shall not be dwelt in even to generation and generation.
{50:40} As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and her neighbors, says Jehovah; a man shall not dwell there, and the son of man shall not sojourn in her.
{50:41} Behold, a people coming from the north and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the thighs of the earth.
{50:42} They shall hold the bow and the javelin: they are fierce, and they will not pity: their voice shall sound as the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, being arranged as a man for war, against thee, O daughter of Babel.
{50:43} The king of Babel heard their report, and his hands were relaxed: anguish seized him as the pain of her bringing forth.
{50:44} Behold, as a lion he will come up from the excellency of Jordan to the habitation of strength: for I will wink; I will cause them to run away from her: and who the chosen I shall appoint to her? for who like me? and who shall arraign me? and who that shepherd who shall stand before me?
{50:45} For this, hear ye the counsel of Jehovah which he counseled against Babel; and his purposes which he purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: if the last of the flock shall not drag them out: if he shall not lay waste the habitation upon them.
{50:46} From the voice of the taking of Babel the earth was shaken, and the cry was heard among the nations.
{51:1} Thus said Jehovah: Behold me raising up against Babel and against those dwelling in the heart of those rising up, a destroying spirit.
{51:2} And I sent forth to Babel those scattering, and they scattered her, and they shall empty her land: for they were against her round about in the day of evil.
{51:3} Against him bending shall he bending, bend the bow, and against him going up in his coat of mail: and ye shall not spare to her young men; exterminate all her army.
{51:4} And the wounded fell in the land of the Chaldeans, and those being thrust through in her streets.
{51:5} For Israel not in widowhood, and Judah from his God, from Jehovah of armies; if their land was filled with guilt because of the Holy One of Israel.
{51:6} Flee from the midst of Babel and save ye each his soul: ye shall not be destroyed in her iniquity: for it is the time of vengeance to Jehovah; he will do to her a recompense.
{51:7} Babel a cup of gold in the hand of Jehovah, making all the earth drunk: the nations drank from her wine; for this the nations will be foolish.
{51:8} Babylon fell suddenly, and she will be broken: wail ye for her; take balsam for her pain, perhaps she will be healed.
{51:9} We healed Babel, and she was not healed: forsake ye her and we will go each to his land: for her judgment reached to the heavens, and was lifted up even to the clouds.
{51:10} Jehovah brought forth our justice: come ye, and we will recount in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.
{51:11} Polish the arrows; fill the quivers: Jehovah roused up the spirit of the kings of the Males: for his purpose is against Babel, to destroy her; for it is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance of his temple.
{51:12} Lift ye up a signal against the walls of Babel, strengthen the watch, set up the watchers, prepare the ambushes: for Jehovah also purposed and also did what he spake to the inhabitants of Babel.
{51:13} Dwelling upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end came, the measure of thy plunder.
{51:14} Jehovah of armies sware by his soul: That if I filled thee with men as with locusts, and they struck up a shout against thee.
{51:15} He made the earth by his power, he prepared the habitable globe by his wisdom, and by his understanding he stretched forth the heavens.
{51:16} For a voice he gives a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he will bring up the clouds, from the extremity of the earth, making lightnings to the rain, and he will bring forth the wind from his treasures.
{51:17} Every man was brutish from knowledge; every founder was ashamed from his carved image: for his founding is a falsehood, and no spirit in them.
{51:18} They are vanity, the work of delusions: in the time of reviewing they shall perish.
{51:19} Not as these the portions of Jacob; for he the former of all: and the rod of his inheritance: Jehovah of armies his name.
{51:20} Thou a mallet to me, a weapon of war: and I broke the nations in pieces with thee, and I destroyed kingdoms with thee;
{51:21} And I broke in pieces with thee the horse and his rider; and I broke in pieces with thee the chariot and its charioteer;
{51:22} And I broke in pieces with thee man and woman; and I broke in pieces with thee the old man and the boy; and I broke in pieces with thee the young man and the virgin;
{51:23} And I broke in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and I broke in pieces with thee the husbandman and his yoke; and I broke in pieces with thee the prefects and the rulers.
{51:24} And I recompensed to Babel and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil which they did in Zion before your eyes, says Jehovah.
{51:25} Behold me against thee, thou destroying mountain, says Jehovah, destroying all the earth: and I stretched out my hand upon thee, and I rolled thee from the rocks, and I gave thee for a burnt mountain.
{51:26} And they shall not take from thee a stone for a corner, and a stone for foundations; for thou shalt be desolations forever, says Jehovah.
{51:27} Lift up a signal in the earth, strike ye the trumpet in the nations, consecrate the nations against her, cause ye to be heard against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint over her a satrap; bring up the horse as the bristling locust.
{51:28} Consecrate against her the nations, with the kings of the Medes, her prefects and all her rulers, and all the land of his dominion.
{51:29} And the earth shall shake and be wearied; for the purpose of Jehovah was set up against Babel, to set the land of Babel for a desolation from not being inhabited.
{51:30} The strong ones of Babel ceased to fight; they dwelt in fastnesses; their strength failed; they were for women: they burned her dwellings; her bars were broken.
{51:31} A runner shall run to meet a runner, and he announcing, to meet him announcing, to announce to the king of Babel that his city was taken from the extremity.
{51:32} And the passages were taken, and they burnt the ropes in fire, and the men of war trembled.
{51:33} For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel: the daughter of Babel is as a threshing-floor, the time of her treading; yet a little while and the time of harvest coming to her.
{51:34} Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel consumed us, he destroyed us, he set us an empty vessel, he swallowed us down as a dragon, he filled his belly with my delicacies, he thrust us away.
{51:35} My violence and my remainder upon Babel, shall she dwelling in Zion say; and my blood to the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
{51:36} For this, thus said Jehovah: Behold me pleading thy cause, and I took vengeance with thy vengeance; and I dried up her sea, and made her fountains dry.
{51:37} And Babel was for heaps, a habitation of jackals, an astonishment and a hissing, from none inhabiting.
{51:38} Together as lions shall they roar: they shook themselves as the lion's whelps.
{51:39} In their heat I will set their drinkings, and I made them drunken so that they shall exult, and sleep an eternal sleep, and they shall not rouse up, says Jehovah.
{51:40} I will bring them down as lambs for the slaughter, as rams with he goats.
{51:41} How was Sheshach taken and the praise of all the earth will be seized; how was Babel for a desolation among the nations!
{51:42} The sea came up against Babel: with the multitude of rolling waves was she covered.
{51:43} Her cities were for a desolation, a land of dryness and a sterile region, a land not a man dwells in them, and not the son of man shall pass through them.
{51:44} And I reviewed over Bel in Babel, and brought forth his swallowing from his mouth: and the nations shall no more flow to him: also the wall of Babel fell.
{51:45} Go ye out from her midst, my people, and save ye each his soul from the burning of the anger of Jehovah.
{51:46} And lest your heart shall be faint and ye be afraid for the report being heard in the land; and a report came in a year, and after it in a year a report, and violence in the land, dominion against dominion.
{51:47} For this, behold, the days coming and I reviewed upon the carved images of Babel: and all her land shall be ashamed, and all her wounded shall fall in her midst.
{51:48} And the heavens and the earth shouted against Babel, and all which is in them: for those laying waste shall come against her from the north, says Jehovah.
{51:49} Also Babel for the falling of the wounded of Israel, also for Babel fell the wounded of all the earth.
{51:50} Being saved from the sword, go: ye shall not stand: remember from far off Jehovah, and Jerusalem shall come up upon your heart.
{51:51} We were ashamed for we heard reproach: shame covered our faces, for strangers came to the holy places of the house of Jehovah.
{51:52} For this, behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I reviewed upon her carved images: and in all her land the wounded shall groan.
{51:53} If Babel shall go up to the heavens, and if she shall fortify the height of her strength, from me shall they laying waste come to her, says Jehovah.
{51:54} The voice of a cry from Babel, and a great breaking from the land of the Chaldeans:
{51:55} For Jehovah laid Babel waste, and he destroyed from her the great voice: and the billows roared as many waters, and a noise of their voice was given.
{51:56} For he spoiling came upon her, upon Babel, and her strong ones were taken, their bow was broken: for the God of recompenses, Jehovah requiting will requite.
{51:57} And I made drunk her chiefs and her wise, her prefects and her rulers, and her strong ones: and they shall sleep an eternal sleep, and they shall not rise up, says the King, Jehovah of armies his name.
{51:58} Thus said Jehovah of armies: The broad walls of Babel being demolished, shall be demolished, and her high gates shall be burnt in fire; the peoples shall labor in vain, the nations for the fire, and they shall be weary.
{51:59} The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah, son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, in his going with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babel, in the fourth year to his reigning. And Seraiah was chief of the resting place.
{51:60} And Jeremiah will write all the evil which shall come to Babel, in one book, all these words being written against Babel.
{51:61} And Jeremiah will say to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babel, and thou sawest, and didst read all these words,
{51:62} And thou saidst, O Jehovah, thou spakest against this place, to cut it off, for none to be dwelling in it, to man and even to beast, for it shall be desolations forever.
{51:63} And it was as thou finishedst to read this book, thou shalt bind upon it a stone and cast it into the midst of Phrath
{51:64} And thou saidst, Thus shall Babel sink, and shall not rise from the face of the evil which I bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Even to this the words of Jeremiah.
{52:1} The son of twenty and one years was Zedekiah in his reigning, and eleven years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
{52:2} And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all which Jehoiakim did.
{52:3} For upon the anger of Jehovah it was in Jerusalem and Judah, till his casting them away from his face, and Zedekiah will rebel against the king of Babel.
{52:4} And it will be in the ninth year to his reigning, in the tenth month, in the tenth to the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem and they will encamp against her, and a watchtower against her round about.
{52:5} And the city will go into siege till the eleventh year to king Zedekiah.
{52:6} In the fourth month, in the ninth to the month, and the famine will be strong in the city, and there was not bread for the people of the land.
{52:7} And the city will be broken up, and all the men of war will flee and will go forth from the city by night, the way of the gate between the walls, which was by the king's garden; (and the Chaldeans upon the city round about:) and they will go the way of the sterile region.
{52:8} And the army of the Chaldeans will pursue after the king, and they will overtake Zedekiah in the sterile regions of Jericho; and all his strength was scattered from him.
{52:9} And they will seize the king and they will bring him up to the king of Babel to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he will speak judgment with him.
{52:10} And the king of Babel will slaughter the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: and he slaughtered also all the chiefs of Judah in Riblah.
{52:11} And he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babel will bind him with fetters and bring him to Babel and give him in the house of wards till the day of his death.
{52:12} And in the fifth month, in the tenth to the month, this year the nineteenth year to king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, came Nebuzaradan, chief of the cooks, standing before the face of the king of Babel, into Jerusalem,
{52:13} And he will burn the house of Jehovah, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great house he burnt in fire:
{52:14} And all the walls of Jerusalem round about, all the strength of the Chaldees which were with the chief of the cooks, brake down.
{52:15} And from the weak of the people, and the rest of the people being left in the city, and those falling away which fell to the king of Babel, and the rest of the multitude, Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks carried into exile.
{52:16} And from the weak of the land, Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks left for vine-dressers and for ploughmen.
{52:17} And the pillars of brass which were to the house of Jehovah, and the bases, and the sea of brass which was in the house of Jehovah, the Chaldeans brake in pieces, and they will lift up their brass to Babel.
{52:18} And the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the vases and the dishes, and all the vessels of brass which they served in them, they took.
{52:19} And the basins and the fire-pans and the vases and the pots and the chandeliers, and the dishes and the cups, which were of gold, gold, and which of silver, silver, the chief of the cooks took.
{52:20} The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve oxen of brass which were under the bases, which king Solomon made for the house of Jehovah; there was no weight to their brass of all these vessels.
{52:21} And the pillars, eighteen cubits the height of the one pillar; and a thread of twelve cubits will surround it; and its thickness four fingers: it was hollow.
{52:22} And a capital upon it of brass; and the height of the one capital, five cubits, and the net and the pomegranates upon the capitals round about, all of brass. And according to these, to the second pillar and the pomegranates.
{52:23} And the pomegranates were ninety and six a side; all the pomegranates a hundred upon the net round about.
{52:24} And the chief of the cooks will take Seraiah the priest, the head, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three watchers of the threshold:
{52:25} And from the city he took one eunuch who was appointed over the men of war; and seven men seeing the face of the king, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the chief of the army mustering the people of the land; and sixty men from the people of the land being found in the midst of the city.
{52:26} And Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks, will take them, and will bring them to the king of Babel to Riblah.
{52:27} And the king of Babel will strike them, and kill them in Riblah in the land of Hamath. And Judah will be carried into exile from his land.
{52:28} This the people which Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and twenty and three.
{52:29} In the eighteenth year to Nebuchadnezzar, eight hundred thirty and two souls from Jerusalem:
{52:30} In the three and twentieth year to Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five souls: all the souls four thousand and six hundred.
{52:31} And it will be in the thirty and seventh year to the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty and fifth to the month, Evil Merodach, king of Babel, in the year of his reigning lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him forth from the house of the prison,
{52:32} And he will speak with him good things, and he will give his throne from above to the throne of the kings which were with him in Babel,
{52:33} And he changed the garment of his shutting up: and he ate bread before him continually all the days of his life.
{52:34} And his ration a ration continually, given to him from the king of Babel, the word of a day in its days, even to the day of his death, all the days of his life.
