{1:1} And it will be in the thirtieth year, in the fourth, in the fifth to the month, and I in the midst of the captivity by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened and I shall see visions of God.
{1:2} In the fifth to the month, this the fifth year to the captivity of king Jehoiachin,
{1:3} The word of Jehovah being, was to Jehezhel, son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of the Chaldean by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah will be there upon him.
{1:4} And I shall see, and behold, the spirit of a tempest came from the north, a great cloud, and a fire taking itself, and a shining to it round about, and from its midst as the appearance of burnished brass from the midst of the fire.
{1:5} And from its midst the likeness of four living creatures: and this their vision; and the likeness of a man to them.
{1:6} And four faces to one, and four wings to one, to them.
{1:7} And their feet a straight foot; and the sole of their feet as the sole of a calf's foot; and sparkling as the appearance of polished brass.
{1:8} And his hand of a man from under their wings upon their four sides; and their faces and their wings to these four.
{1:9} And their wings joined every one to the other; they will not turn in their going, they will go each over against his face.
{1:10} And the likeness of their face, the face of a man and the face of a lion, to the right, to these four: and the face of an ox from the left to these four; and the face of an eagle to these four.
{1:11} And their faces: and their wings spread out from above; to each of the two being joined each, and two covering their bodies.
{1:12} And they will go each over against his face; to where the spirit will be there to go, they will go; they will not turn in their going.
{1:13} And the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance as burning coals of fire, as the appearance of flames going about between the living creatures; and a shining to the fire, and from the fire will go forth lightning.
{1:14} And the living creatures ran and turned back as the appearance of lightning.
{1:15} And I shall see the living creatures, and behold, one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, to his four faces.
{1:16} The appearance of the wheels and their works as the appearance of topaz: and one likeness to these four: and their appearance and their works as a wheel will be in the midst of the wheel.
{1:17} In their going they will go upon their four sides: they will not turn in their going.
{1:18} And their backs, and the height to them, and terror to them; and their backs full of eyes round about to them four.
{1:19} And in the going of the living creatures, the wheels will go by them: and in the lifting up of the living creatures from the earth the wheels will be lifted up.
{1:20} To where the spirit will be there to go they will go, there the spirit to go; and the wheels will be lifted up with them: for the spirit of life in the wheels.
{1:21} In their going, they will go: and in their standing, they will stand; and in their being lifted up from the earth the wheels will be lifted up with them: for the spirit of life in the wheels.
{1:22} And the likeness upon the heads of the living creatures a firmament as the eye of the terrible crystal, stretched forth upon their heads from above.
{1:23} And under the expansion their wings straight each to the other: to each, two, covering upon them, to each two covering to them their bodies.
{1:24} And I shall hear the voice of their wings, as the voice of many waters, as the voice of the Almighty in their going, the voice of speech, as the voice of a camp: in their standing, their wings will slacken.
{1:25} And a voice will be from above to the expansion which was over their head; in their standing their wings will slacken.
{1:26} And from above to the expansion which was over their head as the appearance of a sapphire stone: the likeness of a throne, and over the likeness of a throne, the likeness as the appearance of a man upon it from above.
{1:27} And I shall see as the appearance of burnished brass, as the appearance of fire within to it round about, from the appearance of his loins and above, and from the appearance of his loins to below, I saw as the appearance of fire, and a shining to it round about.
{1:28} As the appearance of the bow which will be in the cloud in the day of rain, so the appearance of the shining round about This the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And I shall see it and I shall fall upon my face, and I shall hear the voice of him speaking.
{2:1} And he will say to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.
{2:2} And the spirit will come into me as he spake to me, and he will cause me to stand upon my feet, and I shall bear him speaking to me.
{2:3} And he will say to me, Son of man, I send thee to the sons of Israel, to rebellious nations who rebelled against me: they and their fathers transgressed against me even to this same day.
{2:4} And the sons hard of face and strong of heart. I send thee to them; and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah.
{2:5} And if they will hear, and if they will desist, (for they a house of contradiction,) and they shall know that a prophet was in the midst of them.
{2:6} And thou son of man, thou shalt not be afraid of them, and thou shalt not be afraid of their words, if rebels and thorns with thee, and thou art dwelling with scorpions: thou shalt not be afraid of their words, and thou shalt not be terrified from their face, for they a house of contradiction.
{2:7} And speak my word to them, if they will hear and if they will desist: for they are contradiction.
{2:8} And thou son of man, hear what I speak to thee: Thou shalt not be contradiction as the house of contradiction: open thy mouth and eat what I give to thee.
{2:9} And I shall see, and behold, a hand sent to me; and behold, in it a roll of a book.
{2:10} And he will spread it out before me: and it was written the face and the back side: and written upon it lamentations, sighing, and Wo.
{3:1} And he will say to me, Son of man, eat what thou shalt find; eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel.
{3:2} And I shall open my mouth, and he will cause me to eat this roll.
{3:3} And he will say to me, Son of man, thou shalt cause thy belly to eat, and thou shalt fill thy bowels with this roll which I give to thee. And eating it, it will be in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
{3:4} And he will say to me, Son of man, go; come to the house of Israel and speak my word to them.
{3:5} For not to a people deep of lip and heavy of tongue; thou art sent to the house of Israel;
{3:6} Not to many peoples deep of lip and heavy of tongue which thou wilt not hear their words If to them I sent thee, they will hear to thee.
{3:7} And the house of Israel will not hear to thee; for they are not willing to hear to me: for all the house of Israel are strong of forehead, and they are hard of heart.
{3:8} Behold, I gave thy face strong over against their face, and thy forehead strong over against their forehead.
{3:9} As the diamond strong above the rock I gave thy forehead: thou shalt not fear them, and thou shalt not be terrified from their face, for they are a house of contradiction.
{3:10} And he will say to me, Son of man, all my words which I shall speak to thee take into thy heart, and with thine ears hear thou.
{3:11} And go, come to the captivity, to the sons of my people, and speak to them, and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah; if they will hear, and if they will desist.
{3:12} And the spirit will lift me up, and I shall hear behind me a voice of a great shaking: Praised be the glory of Jehovah from his place.
{3:13} And the voice of the wings of the living creatures, kissing one to the other, and the voice of the wheels over against them, and the voice of a great shaking.
{3:14} And the spirit lifted me up, and it will take me and I shall go bitter, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.
{3:15} And I shall go to the captivity, the hill of the green ears, those dwelling at the river Chebar, and where they are sitting there, I shall sit there seven days, being astonished in the midst of them.
{3:16} And it will be from the end of seven days, and the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{3:17} Son of man, I gave thee a watchman to the house of Israel: and hear thou the word from my mouth, and admonish them from me.
{3:18} In my saying to the unjust, Dying, thou shalt die; and thou admonished him not, and thou spakest not to admonish the unjust from his way of injustice to preserve him alive; this unjust one shall die in his iniquity, and his blood I will seek from thy hand.
{3:19} And if thou hast admonished the unjust one, and he turned not back from his evil and from his way of injustice; he shall die in his iniquity and thou deliveredst thy soul.
{3:20} And in the just turning back from his justice and doing evil, and I gave a stumbling-block before his face, he shall die: for thou didst not admonish him, in his sins he shall die, and his justice shall not be remembered which he did; and his blood will I seek from thy hand.
{3:21} And if thou admonishedst the just for the just not to sin, and he sin not, living, he shall live, for he was admonished; and thou didst deliver thy soul.
{3:22} And the hand of Jehovah will be there upon me; and he will say to me, Arise, go forth to the valley, and there I will speak with thee.
{3:23} And I shall arise and go forth to the valley: and behold there the glory of Jehovah stood as the glory which saw by the river Chebar: and I shall fall upon my face.
{3:24} And the spirit will come into me, and will cause me to stand upon my feet, and will speak with me, and my to me, Come in and be shut up in the midst of thy house.
{3:25} And thou, son of man; behold, they gave bands upon thee, and they bound thee with them, and thou shalt not go forth in the midst of them:
{3:26} And will cause thy tongue to cleave to thy palate, and thou wert dumb, and thou shalt not be to them for a man reproving: for they are a house of contradiction.
{3:27} And in my speaking with thee I will open thy mouth, and say thou to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: He hearing, shall hear; and he desisting, shall desist: for they are a house of contradiction.
{4:1} And thou son of man take to thee a brick, and give thou it before thee, and delineate upon it the city Jerusalem;
{4:2} And give siege against it, and build a watch tower against it, and cast a mound against it, and give the camp against it, and set battering-rams against it round about.
{4:3} And thou, take to thee an iron pan and give it a wall of iron between thee and between the city: and prepare thy face against it, and she was in siege, and press upon her. This a sign to the house of Israel.
{4:4} And lie thou upon thy left side, and put the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: the number of days which thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt lift up their iniquity.
{4:5} And I gave to thee the years of their iniquity according to the number of days, three hundred and ninety days: and thou didst bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
{4:6} And finishing these, and thou didst lie upon thy right side the second time, and thou didst bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: a day for a year, a day for a year I gave it to thee,
{4:7} And to the siege of Jerusalem thou shalt prepare thy face, and thine arm being uncovered and prophesy against her.
{4:8} And behold, I gave bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn from thy side to thy side, even to thy finishing the days of thy siege.
{4:9} And thou, take to thee wheat, and barley, and the bean, and lentiles, and millet, and spelt, and give them into one vessel, and make them to thee for bread, the number of days which thou didst lie upon thy side; three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat it.
{4:10} An thy food which thou shalt eat by weight, twenty shekels for a day: from time even to time shalt thou eat it.
{4:11} And water by measure shalt thou drink, the sixth of the bin: from time even to time shalt thou drink.
{4:12} And thou shalt eat it cakes of barley, and it shall be baked with dung coming forth of man, before their eyes.
{4:13} And Jehovah will say, Like this shall the sons of Israel eat their defiled bread among the nations where I shall thrust them away there.
{4:14} And saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah behold, my soul not being defiled: and a carcass and the torn in pieces I ate not from my youth and even till now; there came not flesh of uncleanness into my mouth.
{4:15} And he will say to me, See, I gave to thee the dung of oxen instead of man's dung, and make thy bread upon them.
{4:16} And he will say to me, Son of man, behold me breaking the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they ate bread by weight and with fear; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment.
{4:17} So that they shall want bread and water, and they were astonished, a man and his brother, and they were melted in their iniquity.
{5:1} And thou son of man, take to thee a sharp sword, the barber's razor, thou shalt take them to thee and cause to pass over thy head and over thy beard: and take to the balances of weighing and divide them.
{5:2} Thou shalt burn the third in fire in the midst of the city, according to the filling up of the days of the siege: and taking the third thou shalt strike it with the sword round about it; and the third thou shalt scatter to the wind; and I will draw out the sword after them.
{5:3} And take from thence a few in number and bind them in thy wings.
{5:4} And thou shalt yet take from them and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in fire: from it shall come forth fire to all the house of Israel.
{5:5} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: this is Jerusalem; I set her in the midst of the nations and lands round about her.
{5:6} And she will change my judgments for injustice more than the nations, and my laws more than the lands which are round about her: for they rejected upon my judgments, and my laws they walked not in them.
{5:7} For this, said the Lord Jehovah: Because of your tumult more than the nations which are round about you ye went not in my laws, and my judgments ye did not, and according to the judgments of the nations which are round about you ye did not.
{5:8} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me, me also, against thee, and I did judgments in the midst of thee before the eyes of the nations.
{5:9} And I did in thee what I did not, and what I will no more do like, because of all thine abominations.
{5:10} For this the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I did judgments in thee, and I scattered all thy remnant to every wind.
{5:11} For this, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if not because thou didst defile my holy place with all thine abominable things, and with all thine abominations, and I will also diminish; and mine eye shall not spare, and also I will not pity.
{5:12} A third of thee in death shall die, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third shall fall by the sword round about thee; and the third I will scatter to every wind, and I will draw out the sword after them.
{5:13} And mine anger was completed, and I caused my wrath to rest upon them, and I was comforted: and they shall know that I Jehovah spake in my zeal in my completing my wrath upon them.
{5:14} And I will give thee for a waste, and for a reproach among the nations which are round about thee, before the eyes of all passing by.
{5:15} And it was a reproach and reviling, an instruction and an astonishment to the nations which are round about thee, in my doing judgments in thee in anger and in wrath, and in reproofs of wrath. I Jehovah spake.
{5:16} In my sending the evil arrows of famine upon them which were for destruction, which I shall send to destroy you: and I will add famine upon you, and I broke to you the staff of bread.
{5:17} And I sent upon you famine and the evil beast, and it bereaved thee; and death and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I Jehovah spake.
{6:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{6:2} Son of man, set thy face to the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
{6:3} And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the torrents and to the valleys: behold me, I bring the sword upon you, and I destroyed your heights.
{6:4} And your altars were laid waste, and your images were broken: and I caused your wounded to fall before your blocks.
{6:5} And I gave the carcasses of the sons of Israel before their blocks; and I scattered your bones round about your altars.
{6:6} In all your dwellings the cities shalt be laid waste, and the heights shall be made desolate; so that your altars shall be laid waste and destroyed, and your blocks were broken and ceased, and your images were cut down, and your works were wiped away.
{6:7} And the wounded fell in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
{6:8} And I left in being to you them escaping the sword among the nations, in my scattering you in the lands.
{6:9} And those escaping of you remembered me among the nations where they were carried captive there, because I was broken with their heart of a harlot, which turned away from me, and their eyes committing fornication after their blocks: and they loathed in their faces for the evils which they did for all their abominations.
{6:10} And they shall know that I am Jehovah; not in vain spake I to do to them this evil.
{6:11} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Strike with thy hand and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the famine and by the sword and by death.
{6:12} He being far off, in death shall he die; and he being near shall fall by the sword; and he remaining and he being besieged shall die by famine: and I finished my wrath upon them.
{6:13} And ye knew that I am Jehovah in their wounded being in the midst of their blocks round about their altars, upon every high hill, upon all the heads of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they gave there an odor of sweetness to all their blocks.
{6:14} And I stretched forth my hand upon them, and I gave the land a desolation and an astonishment from the desert of Diblath, in all their dwellings: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
{7:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{7:2} And thou son of man, thus said the Lord Jehovah to the land of Israel: An end, the end came upon the four corners of the land.
{7:3} Now the end upon thee, and I sent mine anger against thee, and I judged thee according to thy ways, and I gave upon thee all thine abominations.
{7:4} And mine eye shall not spare upon thee, and I will not pity: for I will give thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
{7:5} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: An evil, one evil, behold, coming.
{7:6} An end came, the end came: it awaked against thee; behold, it came.
{7:7} The circle came to thee, thou inhabiting the land: the time came, the day of consternation drew near, and not the shout of joy of the mountains.
{7:8} The time drawing near I will pour out my wrath upon thee, and I completed mine anger against thee: and I judged thee according to thy ways, and I gave upon thee all thine abominations.
{7:9} And mine eye shall not spare, and I will not pity: I will give upon thee according to thy ways, and thine abominations, they shall be in the midst of thee; and ye knew that I am Jehovah striking.
{7:10} Behold the day, behold, it came: the circle shall go forth; the rod blossomed, pride flourished.
{7:11} Violence rose up for a rod of injustice: not from them, not from their multitude, and not from their confusion: and nothing eminent in them.
{7:12} The time came, the day drew near: he buying shall not rejoice, and he selling, shall not mourn: for burning upon all her multitude.
{7:13} For he selling shall not turn back to the sale, and it was in their yet living: for the vision for all her multitude; it shall not turn back, and a man shall not be strengthened in his iniquity of his life.
{7:14} They shall strike upon the trumpet, and to prepare all; and none went to the war: for my burning is upon all her multitude.
{7:15} The sword without, and the death and the famine from within: who is in the field shall die by the sword; and who is in the city, the famine and death shall consume him.
{7:16} And they escaping, escaped, and they were on the mountains as doves of the valleys, all of them slain, a man for his iniquity.
{7:17} All hands shall be relaxed, and all knees shall go into water.
{7:18} And they girded on sackcloth and trembling covered them; and shame to all faces, and upon all heads, baldness.
{7:19} They will cast their silver into the streets, and their gold shall be for uncleanness: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the outpouring of Jehovah: they shall not satisfy their souls, and they shall not fill their bowels: for it was the stumbling-block of their iniquity.
{7:20} The matter of his ornament they set for pride; and they made the images of their abominations, their abominable things upon it: for this I gave it to them for uncleanness.
{7:21} And I gave it into the hands of strangers for plunder, and to the unjust of the earth for a spoil; and they profaned it.
{7:22} And I turned my face from them, and they profaned my secret; and the rapacious came into it and profaned it.
{7:23} Make the chain: for the land was filled with judgment of bloods, and the city was filled with violence.
{7:24} And I brought the evil ones of the nations, and they inherited their houses: and I caused the pride of the strong ones to cease, and their holy places were profaned.
{7:25} And terror came, and they sought peace, and none.
{7:26} And ruin upon ruin shall come, and report shall be to report; and they sought a vision from the prophet; and law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the old men.
{7:27} The king shall mourn, and the prince shall put on desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall tremble: from their way will I do with them, and with their judgments I will judge them, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
{8:1} And it was in the sixth year, in the sixth, in the fifth to the month, I sitting in my house, and the old men of Judah sitting before me, and the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell there upon me.
{8:2} And I saw, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins and downward, tire; and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the appearance of burnished brass.
{8:3} And he sent forth the likeness of a hand, and he took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and between the heavens, and it brought me to Jerusalem in the visions of God, to the door of the gate within, looking to the north; where was there the seat of the image of jealousy possessing.
{8:4} And behold there the glory of the God of Israel as the vision which I saw in the valley.
{8:5} And he said to me, Son of man, lift up now thine eyes the way of the north. And I lifter up mine eyes the way of the north, and behold, from the north at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entrance.
{8:6} And he said to me, Son of man, west thou what they are doing, the great abominations which the house of Israel are doing here, to go far off from my holy place? And thou shalt yet turn back, thou shalt see great abominations.
{8:7} And he brought me to the door of the enclosure, and I saw, and behold, one hole in the wall.
{8:8} And he said to me, Son of man, break thou now, into the wall: and I broke through into the wall, and behold, one door.
{8:9} And he said to me, Come and see the evil abominations which they are doing here.
{8:10} And I came and saw, and behold, every form of creeping thing, and beast of abomination, and all the blocks of the house of Israel, delineated upon the wall round about, round about.
{8:11} And seventy men from the old men of the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah, son of Shaphan, stood in the midst of them, standing before them, and each his censer in his hand; and a rich cloud of incense went up.
{8:12} And he said to me, Sawest, thou son of man, what the old men of the house of Israel are doing in darkness, a man in the chambers of his images? for they are saying, Jehovah sees us not; Jehovah forsook the earth.
{8:13} And he said to me, Thou shalt turn back yet; thou shalt see great abominations which they are doing.
{8:14} And he brought me to the door of the gate of the house of Jehovah which was to, the north; and behold, there women sat weeping for Tammuz.
{8:15} And he said to me, Sawest, thou son of man? yet shalt thou turn back, thou shalt see abominations great above these.
{8:16} And he brought me to the enclosure of the house of Jehovah within, and behold, a door of the temple of Jehovah, and between the porch and between the altar, about twenty and five men, their backs to the temple, and their faces to the east; and they worshiping the east to the sun.
{8:17} And he said to me, Sawest, thou son of man? Was it light to the house of Judah doing the abominations which they did here? for they filled the land with violence, and they turned back to irritate me: and behold them sending the branch to their nose.
{8:18} And also I will do in wrath: mine eye shall not spare and I will not pity: and they shall call in mine ear with a great voice, and I will not hear them.
{9:1} And he will call in mine ears with a great voice, saying, Draw near, ye having oversight of the city, each the vessels of his destruction in his hand.
{9:2} And behold, six men coming from the way of the highest gate which looking to the north, and each a weapon of smiting in pieces in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed with linen, an inkhorn of the scribe upon his loins: and they will come and stand by the altar of brass.
{9:3} And the glory of the God of Israel came up from the cherub where he Was upon it, to the threshold of the house. And he will call to the man clothed with linen to whom the inkhorn of the scribe upon his loins.
{9:4} And Jehovah will say to him, Pass through into the midst of the city, in the midst of Jerusalem, and mark a mark upon the foreheads of the men sighing and groaning for all the abominations being done in her midst.
{9:5} And to these he said in mine ears, Pass through into the city after him, and strike: your eye shall not spare, and ye shall not pity.
{9:6} The old man, the young man, and the virgin, and little ones, and women, ye shall slay to destruction: and every man which upon him the mark, ye shall not touch; and ye shall begin from my holy place. And they will begin upon the old men which are before the house.
{9:7} And he will say to them, Defile the house, and fill the enclosures with the wounded: go ye forth. And they went forth and struck in the city.
{9:8} And it will be as they were striking them, and I being left, and I shall fall upon my face, and I shall cry, and saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah! destroyest thou all the remnant of Israel in thy pouring forth thy wrath upon Jerusalem?
{9:9} And he will say to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah, great exceedingly, and the land will be filled with blood and the city being filled with wresting: for they said, Jehovah forsook the land, and Jehovah saw not.
{9:10} And also I, mine eye shall not spare, and I will not pity, I gave their way upon their head.
{9:11} And behold, the man clothed with linen to whom the inkhorn upon his loins, turning back word, saying, I did as thou didst command me.
{10:1} And I shall see, and behold, to the which is over the head of the cherubs, as a stone of sapphire, as the vision of the likeness of a throne was seen over them.
{10:2} And he will say to the man clothed with linen, and he will say, Go in between the wheel, underneath to the cherub, and fill thy fists with coals of fire from between the cherubs, and scatter over the city. And he will go in before mine eyes.
{10:3} And the cherubs standing from the right to the house, in his going in, the man; and the cloud filled in the inner enclosure.
{10:4} And the glory of Jehovah will rise from off the cherub over the threshold of the house, and the house will be filled with the cloud, and the enclosure was filled with the shining of the glory of Jehovah.
{10:5} And the voice of the wings of the cherubs was heard, even to the enclosure without, as the voice to the Almighty in his speaking.
{10:6} And it will be in his commanding the man clothed with linen, saying, Take the fire from between the wheel from between the cherubs; and he will go in and stand by the wheel.
{10:7} And the cherub will stretch forth his hand from between the cherubs to the fire which is between the cherubs, and he will lift up and will give into the fists of him clothed with linen: and he will take and he went forth.
{10:8} And there will be seen to the cherubs the form of a man's hand under their wings.
{10:9} And I shall see, and behold, the four wheels by the cherubs, one wheel by the one cherub, and one wheel by the one cherub: and the vision of the wheels as the eye of a stone of topaz.
{10:10} And their appearances one likeness to them four, as the wheel will be in the midst of the wheel.
{10:11} In their going, upon their four sides they will go; they will not turn in their going, for to the place where the head will turn after it will they go; they will not turn in their going.
{10:12} And all their flesh, and their back, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels being filled with eyes round about, the wheels to them four.
{10:13} To the wheels to them was called, Gilgal! in mine ears.
{10:14} And four faces to the one: the one face the face of the cherub, and the second face the face of a man, and the third, the face of a lion, and the fourth, the face of an eagle.
{10:15} And the cherubs will be lifted up. This the living creature which I saw by the river Chebar.
{10:16} And in the going of the cherubs, the wheels by them will go: and in the lifting up of the cherubs their wings to rise up from the earth, the wheels they also from beside them will not turn.
{10:17} In their standing, they will stand: and in their rising, they will rise with them: for the spirit of life was in them:
{10:18} And the glory of Jehovah went forth from off the threshold of the house, and it will stand over the cherubs.
{10:19} And the cherubs will lift up their wings, and will rise from the earth before mine eyes: in their going forth and the wheels with them, and they will stand at the door of the eastern gate of the house of Jehovah; and the glory of the God of Israel over them from above.
{10:20} This the living creature I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I shall know that they are the cherubs.
{10:21} Four, four faces to the one, and four wings to the one; and the likeness of the hands of a man under their wings.
{10:22} And the likeness of their faces these faces which I saw upon the river Chebar, their appearance and themselves: they will go each over against his face.
{11:1} And the spirit will lift me up and bring me to the east gate of the house of Jehovah looking to the east: and behold, in the door of the gate, twenty and five men; and I shall see in the midst of them Jaazaniah, son of Azur, and Pelatiah, son of Benaiah, chiefs of the people.
{11:2} And he will say to say to me, Son of man, these the men purposing vanity and counseling evil counsel in this city.
{11:3} Saying, It not being near; build houses: this the pot, and we the flesh.
{11:4} For this, prophesy against them, prophesy, thou son of man.
{11:5} And the spirit of Jehovah will fall upon me, and he will say to me, Say, Thus said Jehovah; Thus ye said, O house of Israel: and the risings of your spirit, I knew it.
{11:6} Ye multiplied your wounded in this city, and ye filled its streets with the wounded.
{11:7} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Your wounded which ye set in her midst, they the flesh, and this the pot: and I brought you forth from its midst.
{11:8} Ye feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, says the Lord Jehovah.
{11:9} And I brought you from its midst, and I gave you into the hand of strangers and I did judgment upon you.
{11:10} By the sword shall ye fall upon the bound of Israel; I will judge you and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
{11:11} This shall not be to you for a pot, and ye shall not be in the midst of her for flesh; upon the bound of Israel will I judge you.
{11:12} And ye shall know That I am Jehovah: for in my laws ye went not, and my judgments ye did not; and according to the judgments of the nations round about you ye did.
{11:13} And it will be as I prophesied, and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, died. And I shall fall upon my face and cry with a great voice, and saying, Ah. Lord Jehovah, thou makest a completion with the remnant of Israel.
{11:14} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{11:15} Son of man, thy brethren, thy brethren, the men of thy kin, and all the house of Israel, wholly, which the inhabitants of Jerusalem said to them, Go ye far off from Jehovah; to us this land was given for a possession.
{11:16} For this, say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: If I put them far off among the nations, and if I scattered them in the lands, and I will be to them for a little holy place in the lands where they went there.
{11:17} For this, say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And I gathered you from the peoples, and I collected you from the lands where ye were scattered among them, and I gave to you the land of Israel.
{11:18} And they came there, and they took away all the abominable things, and all the abominations from thence.
{11:19} And I gave to them one heart, and a new spirit I will give in the midst of you; and I turned away the heart of stone from their flesh, and I gave to them a heart of flesh:
{11:20} That they shall walk in my laws, and they shall watch my judgments and do them, and they were to me for a people and I shall be to them for God.
{11:21} And to the heart going to the heart of their abominable things and their abominations, I gave their way upon their head, says the Lord Jehovah.
{11:22} And the cherubs will lift up their wings, and the wheels with them; and the glory of the God of Israel over them from above.
{11:23} And the glory of Jehovah will go up from the midst of the city, and stand upon the mountain which is from the east to the city.
{11:24} And the spirit lifted me up, and it will bring me to Chaldea to the captivity, in a vision by the spirit of God. And the vision which I saw will go up from me.
{11:25} And I shall speak to the captivity all the words of Jehovah which he caused me to see.
{12:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{12:2} Son of man, thou art dwelling in the midst of a house of contradiction, which to them eyes to see, and they saw not: ears to them to hear, and they heard not: for they are a house of contradiction.
{12:3} And thou Son of man, make to thee vessels of captivity and emigrate by day before their eyes; and emigrating from thy place to another place before their eyes; perhaps they will see if they are a house of contradiction.
{12:4} And bring forth thy vessels as vessels of captivity by day, before their eyes: and thou shalt go forth in the evening before their eyes, as the goings forth of captivity.
{12:5} Before their eyes break through to thee in the wall, and bring forth by it.
{12:6} Before their eyes upon the shoulder thou shalt lift up, in thick darkness thou shalt bring forth: thou shalt cover thy face, and thou shalt not see the earth: for I gave thee a wonder to the house of Israel.
{12:7} And I shall do thus as I was commanded: I brought forth the vessels as vessels of captivity by day, and in the evening I broke through for me in the wall with the hand; in the thick darkness I brought forth, upon the shoulder I lifted up before their eyes.
{12:8} And the word of Jehovah will be to me in the morning, saying,
{12:9} Son of man, did not the house of Israel, the house of contradiction, say to thee, What doest thou?
{12:10} Say to them, thus said the Lord Jehovah: The ruler of this burden in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel which they are in the midst of them.
{12:11} Say, I am your wonder: as I did, so it shall be done to them: by emigrating, they shall go into captivity.
{12:12} And the prince which is in the midst of them shall lift up upon the shoulder in thick darkness, and go forth: they shall break through into the wall to bring forth by it: he shall cover his face so that be shall not see the earth with the eye.
{12:13} And I spread my net upon him, and he was taken in my net: and I brought him to Babel the land of the Chaldeans, and he shall not see it, and there he shall die.
{12:14} And all which are round about him to help, and all his hosts, I will scatter to every wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.
{12:15} And they shall know that I am Jehovah, in my scattering them in the nations; and I scattered them in the lands.
{12:16} And I left of them men of number, from the sword and from famine, and from death, so that they shall recount all their abominations among the nations where they went there; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
{12:17} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{12:18} Son of man, thou shalt eat thy bread with trembling, and thou shalt drink thy water with disquiet and with dread;
{12:19} And say to the people of the land, Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to the land of Israel: they shall eat their bread with dread, and they shall drink their waters with astonishment, that her land shall be laid waste from her fulness from the violence of all dwelling in her.
{12:20} And the cities being inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation; and they knew that I am Jehovah.
{12:21} And the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
{12:22} Son of man, what this parable to you upon the land of Israel, saying, The days will be prolonged and every vision perished?
{12:23} For this, say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I caused this parable to cease, and they shall no more use it for a parable in Israel; but speak to them: The days drew near, and the word of every vision.
{12:24} For no more shall there be any vain vision and smooth divination in the midst of the house of Israel.
{12:25} For I am Jehovah: I will speak, what word I will speak and it shall be done; it shall no more be protracted: for in your days, O house of contradiction, I will speak the word, and I did it, says the Lord Jehovah.
{12:26} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{12:27} Son of man, behold the house of Israel saying, The vision which he saw is for many days, and for the times afar off he prophesied.
{12:28} For this, say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: No more shall my words be protracted, for I will speak the word and it shall be done, says the Lord Jehovah.
{13:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{13:2} Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel prophesying, and say to them prophesying from their heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah.
{13:3} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo upon the foolish prophets which are going after their spirit, and they saw not.
{13:4} Thy prophets were as the foxes in the sterile regions, O Israel.
{13:5} Ye went not up into the breaches, and ye will wall in the wall upon the house of Israel to stand in the war in the day of Jehovah.
{13:6} They saw vanity and a divination of falsehood, saying, says Jehovah: and Jehovah sent them not: and they waited to raise up the word.
{13:7} Saw ye not a vision of falsehood, and ye said, a divination of a lie, and saying, says Jehovah; and I spake not.
{13:8} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because ye spake falsehood and saw a lie, for this, behold me against you, said the Lord Jehovah.
{13:9} And mine hand shall be upon the prophets seeing falsehood, and divining a lie: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, and they shall not be written in the writing of the house of Israel, and to the land of Israel they shall not come in; and ye knew that I am the Lord Jehovah.
{13:10} Because, and because they led my people astray, saying, Peace; and no peace; and he built a wall and they plastering it with plaster:
{13:11} Say to them plastering with plaster: And it shall fall: there was a violent rain poured out; and ye, O hailstones, shall fall; and the spirit of storms shall rend.
{13:12} And behold, the wall fell; shall it not be said to you, Where the plastering which ye plastered?
{13:13} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: I rent a spirit of storms in my wrath; and there shall be a violent shower overflowing in mine anger, and stones of hail in my wrath to finish.
{13:14} And I broke in pieces the wall which ye plastered with plaster, and I caused it to touch the earth, and its foundation was uncovered and it fell, and ye were consumed in its midst: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
{13:15} And I finished my wrath upon the wall, and upon those plastering it with plaster, and saying to you, No wall, and none plastering it;
{13:16} The prophets of Israel prophesying to Jerusalem, and seeing for her a vision of peace, and no peace, says the Lord Jehovah.
{13:17} And thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people prophesying from their heart, and prophesy thou against them.
{13:18} And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo to them sewing together cushions for all the joints of the hands, and making cushions upon the head of every height to lie in wait for souls! will ye lie in wait for the souls to my people, and will ye preserve alive the souls to you?
{13:19} Ye will profane me to my people for handfuls of barley and for morsels of bread, to kill the souls which shall not die, and to preserve alive the souls which shall not live, by your falsehood to my people hearing the falsehood?
{13:20} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against your pillows with which ye lie in wait there for the souls to break forth, and I rent them from your arms, and I sent away the souls, the souls which ye lie in wait for to break forth.
{13:21} And I rent your cushions and I delivered my people from your hand, and they shall no more be in your hand for being laid in wait for; and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
{13:22} Because ye afflicted the heart of the just one with falsehood, and I afflicted him not; and to strengthen the hands of the evil one not to turn back from his evil way, to preserve him alive.
{13:23} For this, ye shall not see falsehood, and ye shall no more divine a divination: and I delivered my people from your hand: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
{14:1} And there will come to me men from the old men of Israel, and sit before me.
{14:2} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{14:3} Son of man, these men brought up their blocks upon their heart, and they gave the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face: shall I be sought out, shall I be sought oat for them?
{14:4} For this, speak to them and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: A man, a man of the house of Israel who shall bring up his blocks upon his heart, and shall set up the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and coming to the prophet, I Jehovah answered to him coming according to the multitude of his blocks;
{14:5} So that taking the house of Israel in their heart, which were all of them separated from me by their blocks.
{14:6} For this, say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Turn ye back, and turn away from your blocks; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
{14:7} For a man, a man of the house of Israel, and of the stranger who shall sojourn in Israel, and he shall separate himself from after me, and shall bring up his blocks into his heart, and shall set the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and coming to the prophet to seek out to him for me; I Jehovah will answer to him for me:
{14:8} And I gave my face against that man, and I set him for a sign and for parables, and I cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
{14:9} And if the prophet shall be deceived, and he spake a word, I Jehovah deceived that prophet, and I stretched forth my hand upon him, and I destroyed him from the midst of my people Israel.
{14:10} And they bare their iniquity; as the iniquity of him seeking so shall be the iniquity of the prophet;
{14:11} So that the house of Israel shall no more wander from after me, and they shall no more be defiled with all their transgressions; and they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God, says the Lord Jehovah.
{14:12} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{14:13} Son of man, if a land shall sin against me to cover a transgression, and I stretched forth my hands upon it, and I broke to it the staff of bread, and sent famine upon it, and I cut off from it man and cattle:
{14:14} And were these three men in its midst, Noah, Daniel, and Job, they by their justice shall deliver their souls, says the Lord Jehovah.
{14:15} If I shall cause the evil beast to pass through upon the land, and it was bereaved, and there was desolation from not passing through from the face of the beast:
{14:16} These three men in its midst, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if sons and if daughters they shall deliver; they alone shall be delivered, and the land shall be a desolation.
{14:17} Or I shall bring a sword upon that land, and I said, Sword, thou shalt pass through the land; and I cut off from it man and cattle.
{14:18} And these three men in its midst, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, they shall not deliver sons and daughters, for they alone shall be delivered.
{14:19} Or I shall send death to that land, and I poured out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and cattle.
{14:20} And Noah, Daniel, and Job, in its midst, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if son if daughter they shall deliver; they by their justice shall deliver their soul.
{14:21} For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Also if I sent my four evil judgments, sword and famine, and the evil beast, and death to Jerusalem, to cut off from it man and cattle?
{14:22} And behold, there was left in it an escaping, sons and daughters being brought forth: behold them, they shall be brought forth to you, and ye saw their way and their doings: and ye were comforted concerning the evil which I brought upon Jerusalem, all which I brought upon her.
{14:23} And they comforted you, for ye shall see their way and their doings; and ye know that not in vain did I do all which I did in her, says the Lord Jehovah.
{15:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{15:2} Son of man, what is the tree of the vine above every tree, the vine-shoot which was upon the trees of the forest.
{15:3} Shall wood be taken from it to do for work? or will they take from it a peg to hang upon it any vessel?
{15:4} Behold, it was given to the fire to consume; the fire consumed its two ends, and the midst of it was burned. Will it succeed for work.
{15:5} Behold, in its being whole, it will not do for work: but if the fire consumed it, and it was burnt, did it yet do for work?
{15:6} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: As the tree of the vine upon the tree of the forest which I gave it to the fire for consuming, thus I gave the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
{15:7} And I gave my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, and the fire shall consume them; and they knew that I am Jehovah in my setting my face against them.
{15:8} And I gave the land a desolation, because they transgressed a transgression, says the Lord Jehovah.
{16:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{16:2} Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abomination,
{16:3} And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah to Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity from the land of the Canaanite; thy father the Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite.
{16:4} And thy nativity, in the day thou wert born thy navel was not cut, and thou wert not washed in water for my looking upon; and salting, thou wert not salted, and swathing, thou wert not swathed.
{16:5} No eye spared upon thee to do one of these to thee, to pity upon thee; and thou wilt be east to the face of the field in loathing of thy soul in the day of bringing thee forth.
{16:6} And I shall pass by thee and see thee being trodden under foot in thy bloods, and saying to thee in thy bloods, Live; and saying to thee in thy bloods, Live.
{16:7} I gave thee ten thousand as the sprout of the field, and thou shalt be multiplied and enlarged, and come into ornament of ornaments: the breasts were set, and thy hair sprang up, and thou wert naked and nakedness.
{16:8} And I shall pass by thee and see thee, and behold, thy time the time of loves; and I shall spread my wing over thee and cover thy nakedness: and I shall swear to thee, and come into covenant with thee, says the Lord Jehovah, and thou shalt be to me.
{16:9} And I will wash thee in water, and I will wash thy bloods from off thee, and I will cover thee with oil.
{16:10} And I will clothe thee with variegations, and shoe thee with tahash, and I will bind thee round with fine linen, and cover thee with silk.
{16:11} And I shall deck thee with ornaments, and I shall give bracelets upon thy hands and a chain upon thy throat.
{16:12} And I will give a ring upon thy nose, and earrings for thine ears, and a crown of glory upon thy head.
{16:13} And thou shalt be decked with gold and silver, and thy clothing fine linen and silk, and variegation; fine flour and honey and oil thou didst eat; and thou wilt be fair, very exceedingly, and thou wilt prosper into a kingdom.
{16:14} And a name went forth to thee among the nations in thy beauty: for it was perfected by my decoration which I put upon thee, says the Lord Jehovah
{16:15} And thou wilt trust in thy beauty, and commit fornication upon thy name, and thou wilt pour out thy fornications upon every one passing by; to him it will be.
{16:16} And thou wilt take from thy garments and make to thee heights being spotted, and thou wilt commit fornication upon them: thou earnest not in, and it shall not be.
{16:17} And thou wilt take all thy ornaments from my gold and from my silver, which I gave to thee, and thou wilt make to thee images of a male and commit fornication with them.
{16:18} And thou wilt take thy garments of variegations and cover them: and thou gavest mine oil and mine incense before them.
{16:19} And my bread which I gave to thee, fine flour and oil and honey I gave thee to eat, and thou didst give it before them for an odor of sweetness: and it will be, says the Lord Jehovah.
{16:20} And thou wilt take thy sons and thy daughters which thou didst bear to me, and thou wilt sacrifice them for these to eat From thy fornication is it small?
{16:21} And thou wilt slaughter my sons and give them in causing them to pass through for them.
{16:22} And with all thine abominations and thy fornications thou didst not remember the days of thy youth, in thy being naked and nakedness, and thou wert trod under foot in thy blood.
{16:23} And it will be after all thine evil, Wo, wo to thee! says the Lord Jehovah.
{16:24} Thou wilt build to thee a brothel, and thou wilt make to thee a height in every street.
{16:25} At every head of the way thou didst build thy height, and thou wilt cause thy beauty to be abhorred, and thou wilt open wide thy feet to every one passing by, and thou wilt multiply thy fornication.
{16:26} And thou wilt commit fornication with the sons of Egypt thy neighbors, great of flesh: and thou wilt multiply thy fornications to irritate me.
{16:27} And behold, I stretched forth my hand upon thee, and I will take away thy law, and I will give thee to the soul of those hating thee, the daughters of the rovers, being ashamed of thy way of wickedness.
{16:28} And thou wilt commit fornication with the sons of Assur, from thy not being satisfied; and thou wilt commit fornication with them, and thou wert not satisfied.
{16:29} And thou wilt multiply thy fornication at the land of Canaan with the Chaldeans, and also thou wert not satisfied with this,
{16:30} How thy heart languished, says the Lord Jehovah, in thy doing all these, the work of a woman, an imperious harlot;
{16:31} In thy building thy brothel in the head of every way, and thou madest thy height in every street; and thou wert not as a harlot to scorn a gift.
{16:32} The wife committing adultery, instead of her husband she will take strangers.
{16:33} To all committing fornication they will give liberal gifts: and thou gavest thy liberal gifts to all loving thee, and thou wilt make them a present to come in to thee from round about in thy fornications.
{16:34} And it will be in thee the reverse from women in thy fornications, and none committing fornication after thee: and in thy giving liberal gifts, and none giving liberal gifts to thee; and thou wilt be for the reverse.
{16:35} For this, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah:
{16:36} Thus said the Lord Jehovah Because thy brass was poured out, and thy nakedness will be uncovered in thy fornications to those loving thee, and to all the blocks of thine abominations, and according to the bloods of thy sons which thou gavest to them;
{16:37} For this, behold me gathering all those loving thee whom thou wert pleasant to them, and all whom thou lovedst, with all whom thou hatedst; and I gathered them against thee from round about, and I uncovered thy nakedness to them, and they saw all thy nakedness.
{16:38} And I judged thee with judgments of those committing adultery and pouring out blood; and I gave thee blood of wrath and jealousy.
{16:39} And I gave thee into their hand, and they pulled down thy brothel, and they broke down thy heights, and they stripped thee of thy garments, and they took all thy glory, and they left thee naked and nakedness.
{16:40} And they brought up a convocation against thee, and they stoned thee with stone, and they cut thee in pieces with their swords.
{16:41} And they burnt thy houses with fire, and they did judgments upon thee before the eyes of many women: and I caused thee to cease from a harlot, and also thou shalt no more give hire.
{16:42} And I caused my wrath against thee to rest, and my jealousy departed from thee, and I will no more be irritated.
{16:43} Because that thou didst not remember the days of thy youth, and thou wilt disquiet me in all these; and lo, I also gave thy way upon the head, says the Lord Jehovah: and thou didst not do wickedness upon all thine abominations.
{16:44} Behold, all using parables will use a parable against thee, saying, As the mother, the daughter.
{16:45} Thou thy mother's daughter loathing her husband and her sons; and thou the sister of thy sisters who loathed their husbands and their sons: your mother a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
{16:46} Thine elder sister, Shomeron, she and her daughter dwelling upon thy left hand: and thy sister smaller than thou, dwelling from thy right hand, Sodom and her daughters.
{16:47} And thou wentest not in their ways, and thou didst not their abominations: loathing as a little, and thou wilt be corrupted above them in all thy ways.
{16:48} I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if Sodom thy sister did, she and her daughters, as thou didst, thou and thy daughters.
{16:49} Behold, this was the iniquity of Sodom thy sister, pride, fulness of bread, security of rest was to her and to her daughters, and she strengthened not the hand of the poor and needy.
{16:50} And they will be proud, and they will do abomination before me: and I shall take them away according to what I saw.
{16:51} And Shomeron sinned not according to half thy sins: and thou wilt multiply thine abominations above them, and thou wilt justify thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou didst.
{16:52} And thou also bear thy shame, who didst judge for thy sisters in thy sins which thou didst make abominable above them: they shall be justified more than thou: and also thou, be thou ashamed and bear thy shame in thy justifying thy sisters.
{16:53} And I turned back their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Shomeron and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captivities in their midst:
{16:54} So that thou shalt bear thy shame, and thou wert made ashamed of all which thou didst in thy comforting them.
{16:55} And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall turn back to their beginning, and Shomeron and her daughters shall turn back to their beginning, and thou and thy daughters shall turn back to your beginning.
{16:56} And thy sister Sodom was not for a hearing in thy mouth in the day of thy pride.
{16:57} Before thine evil shall be uncovered as the time of reproach of the daughters of Aram and all round about her, the daughters of the rovers despising thee from round about.
{16:58} Thy wickedness and thine abominations, thou didst bear them, says Jehovah.
{16:59} For thus said the Lord Jehovah: And doing with thee according as thou didst who despised the oath to break the covenant.
{16:60} And I remembered my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I set up to thee an eternal covenant.
{16:61} And thou didst remember thy ways, and thou wert ashamed in thy receiving thy sisters great above thee, to the younger than thee: and I gave them to thee for daughters, and not from thy covenant.
{16:62} And I set up my covenant with thee, and thou knewest that I am Jehovah.
{16:63} So that thou shalt remember, and thou wert ashamed, and there shall no more be to thee an opening of the mouth from the face of thy shame in my expiating for thee for all which thou didst, says the Lord Jehovah.
{17:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{17:2} Son of man, propose an enigma and use a parable to the house of Israel;
{17:3} And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The great eagle great of wings, long of the wing-feather, full of feathers, which to him variegation, came to Lebanon, and he will take the foliage of the cedar.
{17:4} He plucked off the head of the suckers, and he will bring it to the land of Canaan, and he set it in a city of merchants.
{17:5} And he will take from the seed of the land, and he will give it in a field of seed; he took it to many waters, he set it a willow.
{17:6} And it will spring up, and it will be for a spreading vine low of stature, for its branches turning towards him, and its roots will be under him: and it will be for a vine, and it will make branches, and it will send forth foliage.
{17:7} And there will be one great eagle, great of wings, and many feathers: and behold, this vine turned her roots to him, and sent forth her branches to him, to water it from the ascendings of its planting.
{17:8} In a good field by many waters it was planted, to make branches to bear fruit, to be for a great vine.
{17:9} Say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? shall he not pluck up its roots, and cut off its fruit, and dry up all the fresh foliage of its springing up? It shall be dried up, and not in its great strength, and by much people to lift it up from its roots.
{17:10} And behold, being planted, shall it prosper? as the east wind strikes upon it? drying up, shall it not be dried up? it shall be dried up upon the risings of its springing up.
{17:11} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{17:12} Say now to the house of contradiction, Knew ye not what are these? Say, Behold, the king of Babel coming to Jerusalem, and he will take her king and her chiefs, and bring them to him into Babel.
{17:13} And he will take from the seed of the kingdom and cut out with him a covenant, and he will bring him in with an oath, and he took the mighty of the land:
{17:14} To be a low kingdom, not to be lifted up, to watch his covenant to stand to it.
{17:15} And he will rebel against him to send his messengers to Egypt, to give to him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he doing these, escape? and breaking the covenant, and escaping?
{17:16} I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if not in the place the king making him king which he despised his oath, and which he broke his covenant with him, in the midst of Babel he shall die.
{17:17} And not with great strength and with a great convocation, shall Pharaoh do for him in the war by throwing up a mound and by building a watchtower to cut off many souls?
{17:18} And he despised the oath to break the covenant, and behold, he gave his hand, and doing all these he shall not escape.
{17:19} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: I live, if not mine oath which he despised, and my covenant which he brake, and I gave it upon his head.
{17:20} And I spread my net upon him and he was taken in my net, and I brought him to Babel, and I contended with him there for his transgression which he transgressed against me.
{17:21} And all his flight with all his hosts, they shall fall by the sword, and they being left shall be dispersed to every wind: and ye knew that I Jehovah spake.
{17:22} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And I took from the foliage of the cedar, and I gave from the head; I will pluck its suckers a tender one, and I planted upon a mountain of height and heaped up.
{17:23} In the mountain of the height of Israel I will plant it: and it bare a branch, and it made fruit, and it was for a great cedar: and there dwelt under it all fowls of every wing; in the shadow of its branches shall they dwell.
{17:24} And all the trees of the field knew that I Jehovah brought low the tree of height, made high the low tree, I dried up the green tree, and I caused the dry tree to flourish: I Jehovah spake and I did.
{18:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{18:2} What to you making use of this parable upon the land of Israel, saying, The fathers will eat sour grapes and the sons teeth will be blunted?
{18:3} I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if it shall be to you more to use this parable in Israel.
{18:4} Behold, all souls to me; behold, as the soul of the father, and so the soul of the son, they are to me. The soul sinning, it shall die.
{18:5} And if a man shall be just and do judgment and justice,
{18:6} Not to eat upon the mountains, and not to lift up his eyes to the blocks of the house of Israel, and not to defile his neighbor's wife, and he shall not come near to a woman of uncleanness.
{18:7} And he shall not oppress a man; he shall turn back his pledge to the debtor; he will not strip off plunder, his bread he will give to him hungry, and the naked he will cover with a garment;
{18:8} And he shall not give upon interest, and he shall not take interest, from iniquity he shall turn back his hand; he shall do judgment of truth between man to man.
{18:9} In my laws he shall go and he watched my judgments to do the truth; he is just; living, he shall live, says the Lord Jehovah.
{18:10} And he begat a rapacious son, pouring out blood and doing the likeness of one of these.
{18:11} And he doing not all these, but eating upon the mountains and defiling his neighbor's wife,
{18:12} Oppressing the poor and needy, stripping off plunder, he will not turn back the pledge, and he lifted up his eyes to the blocks, doing abomination,
{18:13} Giving upon interest, and taking interest: and living, he shall not live: doing all these abominations, dying, he shall die; his bloods shall be upon him.
{18:14} And behold, he begat a son, and he will see all his father's sins which he did, and he will see and will not do like them;
{18:15} Not eating upon the mountains, and not lifting up his eyes to the blocks of the house of Israel, not defiling his neighbor's wife,
{18:16} And not oppressing a man, not binding the pledge, and not stripping off plunder, giving his bread to him hungry, and clothing the naked with a garment.
{18:17} Turning back his hand from the poor, taking not usury and interest, doing my judgment, going in my laws; he shall not die in the iniquity of his father; living, he shall live.
{18:18} His father because oppressing, he oppressed, stripping off, he stripped off the brother, and he did not good in the midst of my people, and behold him dying in his iniquity.
{18:19} And ye said, Why bore not the son upon the iniquity of the father? and the son doing judgment and justice, watching all my laws, and he will do them; living, he shall live.
{18:20} The soul sinning, it shall die. The son shall not bear for the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear for the iniquity of the son: the justice of the just one shall be upon him, and the injustice of the unjust one shall be upon him.
{18:21} And if the unjust one shall turn back from all his sins which he did, and he watched all my laws and did judgment and justice; living, he shall live; he shall not die.
{18:22} All his transgressions which he did shall not be remembered to him: in his justice which he did he shall live.
{18:23} Delighting, shall I delight in the death of the unjust one? says the Lord Jehovah: not in his turning back from his way and living?
{18:24} And in the just turning back from his justice, and doing iniquity according to all the abominations which the unjust one did, will he do and live? all his justices which he did shall not be remembered: in his transgression which he transgressed and in his sins which he sinned, in them he shall die.
{18:25} And ye said, The way of Jehovah will not make even. Hear ye now, O house of Israel; shall not my way make even? shall not your ways make hot even?
{18:26} In the turning back of the just one from his justice, and doing iniquity and dying in them; in his iniquity which he did he shall die.
{18:27} And in the unjust one turning back from his injustice which he did; and he will do judgment and justice, he shall save his soul alive.
{18:28} And he will see and turn back from all his transgressions which he did, living, he shall live; he shall not die.
{18:29} And the house of Israel said, The way of Jehovah will not make even. Will not my ways make even, O house of Israel, shall not your way not make even?
{18:30} For this I will judge you, O house of Israel, each according to his ways, says the Lord Jehovah: Turn back and withdraw from all your transgressions; and iniquity shall not be to you for a stumbling block.
{18:31} Cast away from you all your transgressions which ye transgressed against me, and make to you a new heart and a new spirit: and wherefore will ye die, O house of Israel?
{18:32} For I shall not delight in the death of him dying, says the Lord Jehovah: and turn ye back and live.
{19:1} And thou, lift thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
{19:2} And say, What thy mother? a lioness: between lions she lay down, in the midst of young lions she brought up her whelps.
{19:3} And she will bring up one of her whelps: it was a young lion, and it will learn to rend the prey eating man.
{19:4} And the nations will hear concerning him; in their pit he was taken, and they will bring him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
{19:5} And she will see that waiting her hope perished, and she will take one of her whelps setting him a young lion.
{19:6} And he will go about in the midst of the lions; he was a young lion, and he will learn to tear in pieces the prey, eating man.
{19:7} And he knew their palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land will be desolate and its fulness from the voice of his roaring.
{19:8} And the nations will give against him round about from the provinces, and they will spread their net upon him, being taken in their pit.
{19:9} And they will give him in a prison with hooks, and they will bring him to the king of Babel: they will bring him into fastnesses so that his voice shall no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
{19:10} Thy mother as a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and covered from much water.
{19:11} And there will be to her rods of strength to the rods of those ruling, and his stature will be lifted up between the thick boughs, and he will be seen in his height from the multitude of his branches.
{19:12} And she shall be plucked up in wrath, she was cast down to the earth, and the wind of the east dried up her fruit: the rods of her strength were broken and dried up, and the fire consumed them.
{19:13} And now being planted in the desert, in a land of dryness and thirst.
{19:14} And a fire will go forth from a rod of her branches; it consumed her fruit, and there was not in her a rod of strength, a rod to rule. It is a lamentation, and it shall be for a lamentation.
{20:1} And it will be in the seventh year, in the fifth, in the tenth to the month, men from the old men of Israel came to seek Jehovah, and they sat before my face.
{20:2} And the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
{20:3} Son of man, speak to the old men of Israel, and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Come ye to seek me? I live, if I will be sought for you, says the Lord Jehovah.
{20:4} Wilt thou judge them, wilt thou judge, son of man? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:
{20:5} And say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the day of my choosing upon Israel, and I will lift up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and I will be known to them in the land of Egypt, and I will lift up my hand to them, saying, I am Jehovah your God;
{20:6} In that day I lifted up my hand to them to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt to the land which I spied out for them flowing milk and honey; this the glory to all lands:
{20:7} And saying to them, Cast ye away each the abominations of his eyes, an ye shall not be defiled with the blocks of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
{20:8} And they will rebel against me, and they would not hear to me: they cast not away each the abominations of their eyes, and they forsook not the blocks of Egypt: and saying, To pour out my wrath upon them, to complete mine anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
{20:9} And I will do for sake of my name, that it was not profaned before the eyes of the nations which they were in the midst of them, which I was made known to them before their eyes to bring them forth from the land of Egypt.
{20:10} And I shall cause, them to go forth from the land of Egypt, and I shall bring them to the desert.
{20:11} And I shall give to them my laws, and my judgments I caused them to know, which a man shall do them and he lived in them.
{20:12} And also my Sabbaths I gave to them to be for a sign between me and between them, to know that I am Jehovah consecrating them.
{20:13} And the house of Israel will rebel against me fit the desert: in my laws they went not, and my judgments they rejected, which a man shall do them and he lived in them: and my Sabbaths they profaned greatly and saying, To pour out my wrath upon them in the desert to finish them.
{20:14} And I shall do for sake of my name, that it was not polluted before the eyes of the nations which I brought them forth before their eyes.
{20:15} And also I lifted up my hand to them in the desert, not to bring them in to the land which I gave flowing milk and honey; this the glory to all lands.
{20:16} Because they rejected upon my judgments, and my laws they went not in them, and my Sabbaths they profaned: for their heart went after their blocks.
{20:17} And mine eye will spare for them from destroying them, and I made not a completion with them in the desert.
{20:18} And saying to their sons in the desert Ye shall not go in the laws of your fathers, and their judgments ye shall not watch, and with their blocks ye shall not be defiled.
{20:19} I am Jehovah your God; go ye in my: laws, and watch ye my judgments and do them.
{20:20} And consecrate my Sabbaths; and they were for a sign between me and between you to know that I am Jehovah your God.
{20:21} And their sons will rebel against me: they went not in my laws, and my judgments they watched not to do them, which a man shall do them and live in them: my Sabbaths they profaned: and saying, To pour out my wrath upon them to complete mine anger against them in the desert.
{20:22} And I turned back my hand; and I will do for sake of my name, that it was not profaned before the eyes of the nations which I brought them forth before their eyes.
{20:23} Also I lifted up my hand to them in the desert, to scatter them in the nations, to disperse them is the lands.
{20:24} Because they did not my judgments, and my laws they rejected, and my Sabbaths they profaned, and their eyes were after their fathers blocks.
{20:25} And also I gave to them laws not good, and judgments they shall not live in them.
{20:26} And I will defile them in their gifts in causing to pass through all bursting open the womb, so that I shall make them desolate, that they shall know that I am Jehovah.
{20:27} For this, speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Yet in this your fathers reviled me, in their transgressing a transgression against me.
{20:28} And I shall bring them to the land which I lifted up my hand to give, it to them, and they will see every high hill and every thick tree, and they will sacrifice there their sacrifices, and they will give there the provocation of their oblation, and they will set there the odor of their sweetnesses, and they will pour out there their libations:
{20:29} And saying to them, What the height where ye go there? And its name will be called Height, even to this day.
{20:30} For this, say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Are ye defiled in the way of your fathers? and commit ye fornication after their abominations?
{20:31} And in lifting up your gifts, in causing your sons to pass into the fire ye are defiled for all your blocks, even to this day: and shall I be sought for you, O house of Israel? I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if I will be sought by you.
{20:32} And the things were coming up upon your spirit which will not be which ye say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the lands to serve wood and stone.
{20:33} I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if not with a strong hand and with an arm stretched out, and with wrath poured out, will I reign over you.
{20:34} And I brought you forth from the peoples, and I gathered you from the lands where ye were scattered in them, with a strong hand and with an arm stretched out, and with wrath panted out.
{20:35} And I brought you into the desert of the peoples, and I judged you there face to face.
{20:36} As I contended with your fathers in the desert of the land of Egypt, so will I contend with you, says the Lord Jehovah.
{20:37} And I caused you to pass under the rod I brought you into the bond of the covenant.
{20:38} And I separated from you the rebellious and those transgressing against me: I will bring them forth from the land of their sojournings, and to the land of Israel they shall not come in: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
{20:39} And ye, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Go serve ye each his blocks, and afterward if ye bear not to me and ye shall not profane my holy name yet with your gifts and with your blocks.
{20:40} For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, there shall all the house of Israel serve me, all in the land: there I will receive them into favor, and there I will seek your offerings and the chief of your liftings up, with all your holy things.
{20:41} With the odor of sweetness I will receive you into favor in my bringing you forth from the peoples, and I gathered you from the lands where ye were scattered in them; and I was consecrated in you before the eyes of the nations.
{20:42} And ye knew that I am Jehovah in my bringing you into the land of Israel, to the land which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers.
{20:43} And ye remembered there your ways, and all your works which ye were defiled in them; and ye shall be wearied in your faces for all your evils which ye did.
{20:44} And ye knew that I am Jehovah in my doing with you for sake of my name, not according to your evil ways and your corrupt deeds, O house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.
{20:45} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{20:46} Son of man, set thy face the way of the south, and drop to the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field.
{20:47} And say to the forest of the south, Hear thou the word of Jehovah; thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me kindling a fire in thee, and it consumed in thee every green tree and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north were burned in it.
{20:48} And all flesh saw that I Jehovah kindled it: it shall not be quenched.
{20:49} And saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah, they say to me, Does he not use parables?
{21:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{21:2} Son of man, set thy face to Jerusalem, and drop to the holy places, and prophesy to the land of Israel;
{21:3} And say to the land of Israel, Thus said Jehovah: behold me against thee, and I brought forth my sword from its sheath, and I cut off from thee the just and the unjust.
{21:4} Because that I cut off from thee the just and the unjust, for this my sword shall go forth from its sheath against all flesh, from south to north.
{21:5} And all flesh knew that I Jehovah brought forth my sword from its sheath: it shall no more turn back.
{21:6} And thou son of man, sigh with the breaking of the loins; and with bitterness thou shalt sigh before their eyes.
{21:7} And it was when they shall say to thee, For what sighest thou? and say, For the report, because it came: and every heart melted and all hands were relaxed, and every spirit was weak, and all knees shall go into water: behold, it came, and it was, says the Lord Jehovah.
{21:8} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{21:9} Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus said Jehovah: say, A sword, a sword was sharpened, and also polished.
{21:10} In order to slaughter a slaughter it was sharpened; in order for lightning to be to it, it was polished; then shall we exult? the rod of my son despised, every tree.
{21:11} And he will give it to be polished, to be taken in the hand: this sword was sharpened, and it was polished to give it into the hand of him slaying.
{21:12} Cry and wail, son of man, for it was upon my people, it was upon all the princes of Israel: terrors for the sword were upon my people: for this, strike upon thy thigh.
{21:13} For it is a trial, and what if also the rod was rejected? it shall not be, says the Lord Jehovah.
{21:14} And thou, son of man, prophesy, and strike hand to hand, and thou shalt double the sword the third time, the sword of the wounded: this the sword of the great wounded besieging them.
{21:15} In order to melt the heart and to multiply the ruins, I gave the turning of the sword against all their gates: Ah! it was made for lightnings, it was polished for slaughter.
{21:16} Unite thyself to the right, set thyself to the left, where thy face wavers.
{21:17} And I also will strike my hand to my hand, and I caused my wrath to cease: I Jehovah spake.
{21:18} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{21:19} And thou son of man, set to thee two ways for the sword of the king of Babel to come: from one land shall come forth they two, and form thou a hand, form upon the head of the way of the city.
{21:20} Thou shalt set the way for the sword to come to Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.
{21:21} For the king of Babel stood at the mother of the way in the head of the two ways, to divine a divination; he shook with the arrows, he asked in the family gods, he looked in the liver.
{21:22} In his right hand was the divination of Jerusalem, to set battering-rams, to open the mouth in breaking in pieces, to lift up the voice with a loud noise, to set battering-rams against the gates, to throw up a mound, to build a watch-tower.
{21:23} And it was to them as a divination of falsehood in their eyes, swearing an oath to them, remembering iniquity to be taken.
{21:24} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of your causing your iniquity to be remembered, in your transgressions being uncovered, for your sins to be seen in all your works; because of your causing to be remembered, ye shall be taken in hand.
{21:25} And thou profane unjust prince of Israel, to whom his day came in the time of iniquity the end.
{21:26} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Remove the tiara, and lift up the crown: this not thus: lift up the low, and make low the high.
{21:27} Perverted, perverted, perverted, will I set her: and this was not till he came which to him the judgment; and I gave him.
{21:28} And thou son of man, prophesy and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the sons of Ammon, and for their reproach; and say, The sword, the sword was loosed: for slaughter it was polished, to consume for sake of the lightning:
{21:29} In seeing vanity to thee, in divining to thee a lie to give thee, to the necks of the wounded of the unjust, to whom their day came in the time of iniquity the end.
{21:30} Turn back; thou shalt not be naked: in the place where thou wert created, in the land of thy nativity, will I judge thee.
{21:31} I poured out my wrath upon thee; in fire I made mine anger to pass over thee, and I gave thee into the hand of brutish men, machinating destruction.
{21:32} Thou shalt be to the fire for consuming; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt not be remembered: for I Jehovah spake.
{22:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{22:2} Thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the city of bloods, and make her to know all her abominations?
{22:3} And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The city poured out blood in the midst of her, for her time to come; and she made blocks for herself to be defiled.
{22:4} In thy blood which thou didst pour out thou went guilty; and by thy blocks which thou didst make thou wert defiled; and thou wilt cause thy days to draw near, and thou wilt come even to thy years: for this, I gave thee a reproach to the nations, and a derision to all the lands.
{22:5} Those being near and those being far off from thee will scoff at thee; thou wert defiled of name and much in consternation.
{22:6} Behold, the princes of Israel they were a man to his arm to pour out blood in thee.
{22:7} They made light of father and mother in thee: they did with violence to the stranger in the midst of thee: they oppressed the orphan and the widow in thee.
{22:8} Thou didst despise my holy place, and thou didst profane my Sabbaths.
{22:9} Men of slander were in thee to pour forth blood: and they ate upon the mountains in thee: they did wickedness in the midst of thee.
{22:10} Thy father's nakedness was uncovered in thee: they humbled her set apart for uncleanness in thee.
{22:11} And a man did abomination with his neighbor's wife; and a man defiled his daughter-in-law in wickedness; and a man humbled his sister, his father's daughter, in thee.
{22:12} They took a gift in thee to pour out blood; thou tookest usury and interest, and thou wilt plunder thy neighbors by violence, and thou didst forget me, says the Lord Jehovah.
{22:13} And behold, I struck my hand at thy plunder which thou madest, and at thy blood which was in the midst of thee.
{22:14} Will thy heart stand, or will thine hands be strong for the day which I do with thee? I Jehovah spoke, and I did.
{22:15} And I scattered thee in the nations, and I dispersed thee in the lands, and I consumed thy uncleanness out of thee.
{22:16} And thou didst inherit in thee before the eyes of the nations, and thou knewest that I am Jehovah.
{22:17} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{22:18} Son of man, the house of Israel became to me for dross: all they brass and alloy, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they were drosses of silver.
{22:19} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: because all of them were for drosses, for this, behold me gathering you into the midst of Jerusalem.
{22:20} The gathering silver and brass and iron and lead and alloy to the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it, to melt; so will I gather in mine anger and in my wrath, and I put down and melted you.
{22:21} And I gathered you and blew upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye were melted in her midst.
{22:22} As silver being melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in her midst; And ye knew that I Jehovah poured out my wrath upon you.
{22:23} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{22:24} Son of man, say to her, Thou a land not being cleansed; it was not rained upon in the day of anger.
{22:25} A conspiracy of her prophets in her midst as a roaring lion rending the prey; they consumed the soul; they will take the wealth and the precious thing; they multiplied her widows in her midst.
{22:26} Her priests did violence to my law, and they will profane my holy place: between the holy to the profane they separated not, and they did not make known between the unclean to the clean, and from my Sabbath they hid their eyes, and I shall be profaned in the midst of them.
{22:27} Her chiefs in her midst as wolves rending the prey, to pour out blood, to destroy souls, for the sake of plundering plunder.
{22:28} And her prophets plastered plaster upon them, seeing vanity, and divining to them falsehood, saying Thus said the Lord Jehovah; and Jehovah spoke not.
{22:29} The people of the land oppressed with violence and stripped off robbery, and oppressed the poor and needy, and did violence to the stranger without judgment.
{22:30} And I sought from them a man to wall in the wall, and to stand in the breach before my face for the land, not to destroy it: and I found not.
{22:31} I will pour out my wrath upon them; I consumed them in the fire of mine anger: I gave their way upon their head, says the Lord Jehovah.
{23:1} The word of Jehovah will come to me, saying,
{23:2} Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother:
{23:3} And they will commit fornication in Egypt; in their youth they committal fornication: there were their breasts pressed, and the breasts of their virginity fell away.
{23:4} And their names Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister; and they will be to me, and they will bring forth sons and daughters, and their names Shomeron-Aholah and Jerusalem Aholibah.
{23:5} And Aholah will commit fornication under me; and she will desire after those loving her, after Assur, they being near.
{23:6} Putting on cerulean purple, prefects and governors, young men of desire all of them, horsemen riding horses.
{23:7} And she will give her whoredoms upon them from the choice of the sons of Assur all of them, and with all whom she desired; being defiled with all their blocks.
{23:8} And her fornications from Egypt she forsook not: for they lay with her in her youth, and they handled the breasts of her virginity, and they will pour forth her fornications upon her.
{23:9} For this I delivered her into the hand of those loving her, into the hand of the sons of Assur whom she desired after them.
{23:10} They uncovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters and slew them with the sword: and she will be a name to women, and they did judgments upon her.
{23:11} And her sister Aholibah will see, and she will corrupt her love more than they, and her fornications more than the fornication of her sister.
{23:12} She desired after the sons of Assur, prefects and governors, being near, putting on splendor, horsemen riding horses, young men of desire, all of them.
{23:13} And I shall see that one way was defiled to both of them.
{23:14} And she will add to her fornications: and she will see men delineated upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans being delineated with red color.
{23:15} Girding girdles upon their loins, a superfluity of dippings upon their heads, the appearance of third men all of them, the likeness of the sons of Babel of Chaldea, the land of their birth.
{23:16} And she will desire after them at the sight of her eyes, and she will send messengers to them to Chaldea.
{23:17} And the sons of Babel will come to her to the bed of loves, and defile her with their fornications, and she will be defiled with them, and her soul will be rent away from them.
{23:18} And she will uncover her fornications, and she will uncover her nakedness: and my soul will be rent away from her, as my soul was rent away from her sister.
{23:19} And she will multiply her fornications, to remember the days of her youth when she committed fornication in the land of Egypt.
{23:20} And she will desire after their paramours, whom the flesh of asses their flesh, and the flowing of horses their flowing.
{23:21} And thou wilt review the wickedness of thy youth in the doing of Egypt thy breasts for the breasts of thy youth.
{23:22} For this, O Aholibah, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me raising up those loving thee, against thee, whom thy soul was rent away from them, and I brought them against thee from round about.
{23:23} The sons of Babel and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, all the sons of Amur with them: young men of desire, prefects and governors, all of them third men, and celebrated, riding horses all of them.
{23:24} And they came against thee firm with chariot and wheel, and with a convocation of peoples, shield and buckler and helmet, they will set against thee round about: and I gave judgment before them, and they judged thee with their judgments.
{23:25} And I gave my jealousy against thee, and they did with thee in wrath: thy nose and thine ears they shall take away; and thy posterity shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters, and thy posterity shall be consumed in fire.
{23:26} And they stripped thee of thy garments, and they took the instrument of thy glory.
{23:27} And I caused thy wickedness to cease from thee, and thy fornication from the land of Egypt: and thou shalt not lift up thine eyes to them, and thou shalt remember Egypt no more.
{23:28} For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me giving thee into the hand of whom thou didst hate, into the hand of whom thy soul was rent away from them.
{23:29} And they did with thee in hatred, and they took all thy labor, and they left thee naked and nakedness: and the nakedness of thy fornication was uncovered, and thy wickedness and thy fornications.
{23:30} Doing these to thee for thy fornications after the nations, because thou wert defiled with their blocks.
{23:31} Thou wentest in the way of thy sister, and I gave her cup into thine hand.
{23:32} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: thou shalt drink thy sister's cup deep and much: thou shalt be for laughter and for derision; containing much.
{23:33} Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and with sorrow, the cup of astonishment and desolation, the cup of thy sister Shomeron.
{23:34} Thou didst drink it and suck out, and thou shalt crush its sherds, and pluck up thy breasts: for I spake, says the Lord Jehovah.
{23:35} For this, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because thou didst forget me, and thou wilt cast me behind thy back, and also bear thou thy wickedness and thy fornications.
{23:36} And Jehovah will say to me, Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah, and announce to them their abominations?
{23:37} For they committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their blocks they committed adultery, and also their sons whom they brought forth to me they caused to pass through for them for consuming.
{23:38} Yet this they did to me: they defiled my holy place in that day, and my Sabbaths they profaned.
{23:39} And in their slaughtering their sons to their blocks, and they will come to my holy place in that day to profane it; and behold, thus they did in the midst of my house.
{23:40} And also that ye will send to men coming from far off, whom a messenger was sent to them, and behold, they came: for whom thou didst wash, thou paintedst thine eyes, and thou didst deck with ornaments.
{23:41} And thou wilt sit upon a splendid bed, and a table set in order before his face, and thou didst bring up there mine incense and mine oil.
{23:42} And the voice of a multitude at rest with her: and to the men of multitude of man bringing Sabeans from the desert, and they will give bracelets upon their hands, and crowns of glory upon their heads.
{23:43} And saying to her worn out with adulteries, Will she now commit her fornications, she also?
{23:44} And they will go in to her as going in to a woman an harlot; thus they went in to Aholah and to Aholibah, the women of wickedness.
{23:45} And just men they shall judge them with the judgment of adultresses, and with the judgment of those pouring out blood; for they are adultresses, and blood in their hands.
{23:46} For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Bring up upon them a convocation and give them for a shaking and for a spoil.
{23:47} And the convocation stoned upon them with stone, and cut them down with: their swords; they will slay their sons and their daughters, and their houses they will burn in fire.
{23:48} And I caused wickedness to cease from the land, and all the women were instructed, and they shall not do according to your wickedness.
{23:49} And they gave your wickedness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your blocks: and ye knew that I am the Lord Jehovah.
{24:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me in the ninth year, in the teeth month, in the tenth to the month, saying,
{24:2} Son of man, write to thee the name of the day, this same day: the king of Babel set up against Jerusalem this same day.
{24:3} And use a parable against the house of contradiction and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Set on the pot, set on, and also pour water into it:
{24:4} Gather its pieces into it, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder; fill with the choice of the bones.
{24:5} Take the choice of the flock and also wheel the bones under it, boil its boilings; also they cooked the bones in the midst of it.
{24:6} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo to the city of bloods! the pot which the rust in it, and her rust went not forth from it; bring it forth by its pieces, by its pieces; the lot fell not upon it.
{24:7} For her blood was in the midst of her; she set it upon a dry rock; she poured it not forth upon the earth to cover over it with dust;
{24:8} To cause wrath to come up, to avenge vengeance; I gave her blood upon the dry rock not to be covered.
{24:9} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo to the city of bloods! I will make her pile great.
{24:10} Multiply the woods, kindle the fire, make ready the flesh, and spice with spicing, and the bones shall be burned.
{24:11} And cause it to stand upon its coals, empty, so that its brass shall be warm and burning, and its uncleanness was melted in the midst of it; its rust shall be consumed.
{24:12} She was wearied with labors, and her great rust shall not go forth from her: in the fire her rust.
{24:13} In thy uncleanness is wickedness: because I cleansed thee and thou wert not cleansed, thou shalt no more be cleansed from thy uncleanness till my causing my wrath to rest upon thee.
{24:14} I Jehovah spake: it came, and I did; I will not let go loose, and I will not spare, and. I will not lament; according to thy ways and according to thy works they judged thee, says the Lord Jehovah.
{24:15} The word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{24:16} Son of man, behold me taking from thee the desire of thine eyes with a blow: and thou shalt not lament, and thou shalt not weep, and thy tears shall not go.
{24:17} Be silent to the sighing of blood, thou shalt not make mourning for the dead; bind thy head-dress upon thee, and thou shalt put thy shoes upon thy feet, and thou shalt not cover over the mustachios, and the bread of men thou shalt not eat.
{24:18} And I shall speak to the people in the morning and my wife will die in the evening and I shall do in the morning as I was commanded.
{24:19} And the people will say to me, Wilt thou not announce to us what these things to us that thou doest?
{24:20} And saying to them, The word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
{24:21} Say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord Jehovah, Behold me profaning my holy place, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and the pity of your soul, and your sons and your daughters whom ye left, shall fall by the sword.
{24:22} And ye did as I did: ye shall not cover over your mustachios, and the bread of men ye shall not eat.
{24:23} And your head-dress upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not lament, and ye shall not weep; and ye pined away m your iniquities, and ye grieved a man to his brother.
{24:24} And Ezekiel was to you for a wonder: according to all which he did ye shall do: in its coming, and ye knew that I am the Lord Jehovah.
{24:25} And thou son of man, was it not in the day, I took from them their strength, the joy of their glory the desire of their eyes, the lifting up of their soul, their sons and their daughters.
{24:26} In that day he escaping shall come to thee to cause to hear with the ears.
{24:27} In that day thy mouth shall be opened to him escaping and thou shalt speak, and thou shalt no more be dumb: and thou wert to them for a wonder, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
{25:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{25:2} Son of man, set thy face against the sons of Ammon, and prophesy against them.
{25:3} And say to the sons of Ammon, Hear ye, the word of the Lord Jehovah, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of thy saying, Aha! to my holy place, when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate, and to the house of Judah, when they went into captivity.
{25:4} For this, behold me giving thee to the sons of the east for a possession, and they set their fortress in thee and in thee they gave their dwelling, they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.
{25:5} And I gave Rabbah for a rest of camels, and the sons of Ammon for a place of lying down of sheep, and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
{25:6} For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of thy striking the hand and thy stamping with the foot and thou wilt rejoice in soul with all contempt against the land of Israel.
{25:7} For this, behold I stretched forth my hand against thee, and I gave thee for a spoil to the nations, and I cut thee off from the peoples; and I caused thee to perish from the lands: I will destroy thee and thou knewest that I am Jehovah.
{25:8} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because Moab said, and Seir, Behold, the house of Judah as all the nations;
{25:9} For this, behold me opening the shoulder of Moab from the cities, from his cities, from his extremity, the glory of the land the house of desolation the place of dwelling, and the double city.
{25:10} To the sons of the east with the sons of Ammon, I gave it for a possession, so that it shall not make mention of the sons of Ammon among the nations.
{25:11} And I will do judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
{25:12} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because Edom did against the house of Judah by revenging vengeance, and they will transgress a transgression, and they revenged against them;
{25:13} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: and I stretched out my hand upon Edom, and I cut of from her man and cattle; and I gave her a waste from the south; and Dedan shall fall by the sword.
{25:14} And I gave my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they did in Edom according to mine anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, says the Lord Jehovah.
{25:15} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because the rovers did in vengeance, and they will avenge vengeance with contempt of heart to destroy, a perpetual enmity;
{25:16} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me stretching forth my hand upon the rovers, and I cut off the executioners, and I destroyed the remnant of the sea coast.
{25:17} And I did great vengeances upon them with reproofs of wrath; and they shall know that I Jehovah, in my giving vengeance upon them.
{26:1} And it will be in the eleventh year, in one of the month, the word of Jehovah was to me, saying.
{26:2} Son of man, because that Tyre said against Jerusalem Aha! she was broken, the doors of the peoples: she was turned to me: I Shall be filled; she was laid waste:
{26:3} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against thee, O Tyre and I brought up many nations against thee as the sea brought up to its waves.
{26:4} And they destroyed the walls of Tyre, and pulled down her towers and I swept away her dust from her, and I gave her for a dry rock.
{26:5} It shall be for spreading nets in the midst of the sea: for I spake, says the Lord Jehovah: and it was for a spoil to the nations.
{26:6} An her daughters who are in the field, shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that am Jehovah.
{26:7} For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me bringing upon Tyre Nebuchadezzar king of Babel, from the north, a king of kings, with horse and with chariot, and with horsemen, and a convocation, and much people.
{26:8} Thy daughters in the field he shall slay with the sword: and he gave a watch-tower against thee, and he threw up a mound against thee, and lifted up the buckler against thee.
{26:9} And he will give the stroke of his front against thy walls, and with his sword he will tear down thy towers.
{26:10} From the abundance of is horses, their dust will cover thee: from the voice of the horseman, and the wheel, and the chariot, thy walls shall shake, in his coming in to thy gates, as the enterings of a city rent asunder.
{26:11} With the hoofs of his horses he will tread down all thy streets: he will slay thy people with the sword, and the garrisons of thy strength shall go down to the earth.
{26:12} And they spoiled thy strength and they plundered thy traffic, and they pulled down thy walls, and they will tear down thy houses of desire, and they will set thy stones and thy woods and thy dust in the midst of the water.
{26:13} And I caused the noise of thy songs to cease and the voice of thy harps shall no more be heard.
{26:14} And I gave thee for a dry rock thou Shalt be a spreading of nets; thou shalt no more be built: for I Jehovah spake, says the Lord Jehovah.
{26:15} Thus said the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: Shall not islands shake from the voice of thy fall, in the cry of the wounded, in the slaying of the slain in the midst of thee?
{26:16} And all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and they removed their robes, and they shall put off the garments of variegations: they shall put on tremblings; they sat upon the earth and trembled at the moments, and were astonished at thee.
{26:17} And they lifted up for thee a lamentation, and they said to thee, How wert thou destroyed being inhabited from the seas, the celebrated city which was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants who gave their terrors to all her inhabitants.
{26:18} Now shall the idles tremble the day of thy fall; and the isles which are in the sea loathed from thy going forth.
{26:19} For thus said the Lord Jehovah: I measured thee a city being desolated as the cities which were not inhabited; in my bringing up the deep upon thee, and many waters covered thee.
{26:20} And brought thee down with them going down to the pit to the people of old, and I set thee in the earth, underneath in desolations from forever with them going down to the pit, so that thou shalt not be inhabited; and I gave glory in the land of the living.
{26:21} I will give thee for terrors, and not thee: and thou shalt be sought and shalt not be found any more forever, says the Lord Jehovah.
{27:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{27:2} Thou son of man, lift up a lamentation for Tyre;
{27:3} And say to Tyre, Thou dwelling at the entrance of the sea, a traffic of the peoples for many islands, thus said the Lord Jehovah: O Tyre, thou saidst, I am perfect of beauty.
{27:4} In the heart of the see thy bound; they building thee completed thy beauty.
{27:5} They built all thy bounds cypress from Shenir: they took cedars from Lebanon to make a mast for thee.
{27:6} The oaks of Bashan they made thine oars; the house of the Ashurites made thy desk of ivory from the isles of Chittim.
{27:7} Fine linen with variegation from Egypt was thy spreading forth to be to thee for a signal; cerulean purple, and reddish purple, from the isles of Elisha was thy covering.
{27:8} The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were rowers to thee: thy wise, O Tyre, were in thee, they thy sailors.
{27:9} The old men of Gebal and her wise were in thee making strong thy breach: all the ships of the sea and thy seamen were in thee to traffic from thy traffic.
{27:10} Persia and Lud and Phut were in thy strength, thy men of war: hung the shield and helmet in thee; they gave thy decoration.
{27:11} The sons of Arvad and thine army upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hung their shields upon thy walls round about; they completed thy beauty.
{27:12} Tarshish thy merchant from the multitude of all riches: in silver, iron, alloy, and lead, they gave thy markets.
{27:13} Javan, Tubal and Meshech, they thy merchants: they gave from thy traffic in the soul of man, and vessels of brass.
{27:14} From the house of Togarmah, horses and horsemen and mules they gave thy markets.
{27:15} The sons of Dedan thy merchants; many isles the traffic of thy hand: and they brought back horns of ivory and ebony.
{27:16} Aram thy merchant from the multitude of thy works: they gave in thy markets with the gem, reddish purple, and variegation, and byssus, and red corals, and ruby.
{27:17} Judah and the land of Israel, they thy merchants: in wheat of Minnith and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balsam, they gave thy traffic.
{27:18} Damascus thy merchant in the multitude of thy works from the multitude of all riches, with wine of Helbon and wool of whiteness.
{27:19} And Dan and Javan going away gave in thy markets: making iron, cassia and sweet cane was in thy traffic.
{27:20} Dedan thy merchant, garments of spreading out for the chariot.
{27:21} Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, they the merchants of thy hand with lambs and rams and he goats: in them thy merchants.
{27:22} The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they thy merchants with the head of all spicery, and with every precious stone and gold they gave thy markets.
{27:23} Haran and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Assur, and Chilmad, thy merchants.
{27:24} They thy merchants in perfections in coverings of cerulean purple, and variegation and in treasures of variegated stuffs bound with cords and made fast in thy markets.
{27:25} The ships of Tarshish celebrating thee in thy traffic; and thou wilt be filled and honored greatly in the heart of the sea.
{27:26} Thy rower brought thee into many waters: the wind of the east broke thee in the heart of the seas.
{27:27} Thy riches and thy markets, thy traffic, thy seamen, and thy shipmen, they making strong thy breach, and they trafficking thy traffic, and all the men of thy war that are in thee, and in all thy convocation which is in the midst of thee, they shall fall into the heart of the sea, in the day of thy fall.
{27:28} At the voice of the cry of thy shipmen, the areas shall shake.
{27:29} All holding the oars, the seamen and the shipmen of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the earth.
{27:30} And with their voice they shall cause to be heard against thee, and they shall cry with bitterness, and they shall bring up dust upon their heads, and they shall roll themselves in ashes.
{27:31} And they made themselves bald with baldness for thee, and they girded themselves with sackcloth, and they wept for thee with bitterness of soul and bitter wailing.
{27:32} And their sons lifted up a lamentation for thee, and they lamented over thee: Who as Tyre, as she desolated in the midst of the sea?
{27:33} In the going forth of thy markets from the seas thou didst satisfy many peoples; with the multitude of thy riches and thy traffics thou didst enrich the kings of the earth.
{27:34} The time thou wert broken from the seas in the depths of the waters, thy traffic and all thy convocation fell in the midst of thee.
{27:35} All the inhabitants of the isles were astonished at thee, and their kings shuddering, shuddered; the faces were moved.
{27:36} The merchants among the peoples hissed at thee; thou wert terrors; and thou not, even forever.
{28:1} The word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{28:2} Son of man, say to the leader of Tyre, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because thy heart was lifted up, and thou wilt say, I am God, I sat upon the seat of God in the heart of the seas; and thou art man and not God, and thou wilt give thy heart as the heart of God.
{28:3} Behold thee wise above Daniel; not any thing hidden was hidden to thee:
{28:4} With thy wisdom and with thy understanding thou madest to thee wealth, and thou wilt make gold and silver in thy treasures.
{28:5} By the multitude of thy wisdom, by thy traffic thou didst multiply thy wealth, and thine heart will be lifted up in thy wealth.
{28:6} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of thy giving thy heart as the heart of God;
{28:7} For this, behold me bringing strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they emptied out their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they profaned thy splendor.
{28:8} They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou didst die the deaths of the wounded in the heart of the seas.
{28:9} Saying, wilt thou say, I am God, before him slaying thee? and thou art man and not God, in the hand of him wounding thee.
{28:10} Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I spake, says the Lord Jehovah.
{28:11} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{28:12} Son of man, lift up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Thou didst seal up the measure full of wisdom and complete of beauty.
{28:13} Thou wert in Eden the garden of God: every precious stone thy covering, the ruby, the topaz, the onyx, the chrysolite, the sardonyx and the jasper, the sapphire, the carbuncle and the emerald, and gold: the work of thy drums and thy pipes were prepared in thee in the day of thy being created.
{28:14} Thou the cherub of expansion covering; and I gave thee: thou wert in the holy mountain of God; thou walkedst about in the midst of the stones of fire.
{28:15} Thou shalt be perfected in thy ways from the day of thy being created even till iniquity was found in thee.
{28:16} In the multitude of thy traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou wilt sin: and I shall profane thee from the mountain of God, and destroying thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
{28:17} Thine heart was lifted up with thy beauty, thou didst corrupt thy wisdom on account of thy splendor: I cast thee upon the earth, I gave thee before kings to look upon thee.
{28:18} From the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic, thou didst profane my holy places; and I will bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall consume thee, and I will give thee for ashes upon the earth before the eyes of all seeing thee.
{28:19} All knowing thee among the peoples were astonished at thee: thou wert terrors; and thou not, even to forever.
{28:20} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{28:21} Son of man, set thy face against Zidon and prophesy against, her,
{28:22} And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against, thee, O Zidon; and I was honored in the midst of thee, and they shall know that I am Jehovah, in my doing judgments upon her; and I was consecrated in her.
{28:23} And I sent death into her, and blood in her streets; and the wounded fell in the midst of her by, the sword upon her from round about: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
{28:24} And no more shall there be to the house of Israel a thorn making bitter; and briars causing pain from all round about them despising them; and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
{28:25} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: in my gathering the house of Israel from the peoples where they were scattered among them, and I was consecrated in them before the eyes of the nations, and they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant Jacob.
{28:26} And they dwelt upon it with confidence, and, they built houses, and they planted vineyards; and they dwelt with confidence in my doing judgments upon all those despising them from round about them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah their God.
{29:1} In the tenth year, in the tenth, in the twelfth to the month, was the word of Jehovah to me, saying,
{29:2} Son of man set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt:
{29:3} Speak and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against thee Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great sea monster lying in the midst of his rivers, who said, The, river is to me, and I made me.
{29:4} And I gave hooks in thy jaw bones, and I glued the fishes of thy rivers upon thy scales, and I brought thee up from the midst of thy rivers, and all the Ashes of thy rivers shall be glued to thy scales.
{29:5} And I cast thee to the desert, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the face of the field; thou shalt not be gathered, and thou shalt not be collected: I gave thee for food to the beast of the earth and to the birds of the heavens.
{29:6} And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah, because they were a support of reed to the house of Israel:
{29:7} In their taking hold upon thee by the hand, thou wilt run and rend for them all the shoulder: and in their leaning upon thee, thou: wilt break, and because to them the loins to stand.
{29:8} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me bringing the sword upon thee, and I cut off from thee man and cattle.
{29:9} And the land of Egypt was for desolation and waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, because he said, The river is to me; I made.
{29:10} For this, behold me against thee, and against thy rivers, and I gave the land of Egypt for wastes of waste, a desolation from the tower Seveneh and even to the bound of Cush.
{29:11} The foot of man shall not pass through it, and the foot of cattle shall not pass through it, and it shall not be inhabited forty years.
{29:12} And I gave the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the lands being desolate, and her, cities in the midst of the cities laid waste shall be a desolation forty years: and I scattered Egypt among the nations and I dispersed them in the lands.
{29:13} For thus said the Lord Jehovah: From the end of forty years I will gather Egypt from the peoples where they were scattered there:
{29:14} And I turned back the captivity of Egypt; and I caused them to turn back to the land of Paths upon the land of their nativity; and they were there a low kingdom.
{29:15} It shall be lower than the kingdoms, and it shall no more be lifted up over the nations: and I made them few not to rule over the nations.
{29:16} And it shall be no more to the house of Israel for trust, bringing iniquity to remembrance in their turning after them: and they shall know that am the Lord Jehovah.
{29:17} And it will be in the twenty and seventh year, in the first, in the one to the month, the word, of Jehovah was to me, saying,
{29:18} Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head being made bald, and every shoulder made smooth: and wages were not to him and to his army from Tyre for the service that he served against her.
{29:19} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me giving to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, the land of Egypt; and he lifted up her multitude, and he spoiled her spoil and plundered her plunder, and it was the wages to his army.
{29:20} I gave to him the land of Egypt the wages which he served against her, because they worked for me, says the Lord Jehovah.
{29:21} In that day I will cause the born to the house of Israel to spring up, and to thee will I give the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah,
{30:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{30:2} Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wail ye, Wo to the day!
{30:3} For the day is near, the day of Jehovah is near, the day of a cloud; it shall be the time of the nations.
{30:4} And the sword came upon Egypt, and pain was upon Cush, in the falling of the wounded in Egypt; and they took her multitude and her foundations were torn down.
{30:5} Cosh and Phut and Lad, and all the intermingled, and Chub, and the sons of the land of the covenant, with them shall fall by the sword.
{30:6} Thus said Jehovah: and they upholding Egypt fell, and the pride of her strength came down: from the tower Seveneh shall they fall in her by the sword, says the Lord Jehovah.
{30:7} And they were desolate in the midst of the lands being desolated, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities being laid waste.
{30:8} And they knew that I am Jehovah in my giving fire in Egypt, and all her helpers were broken.
{30:9} In that day shall go forth messengers from before me in ships to make confiding Cush afraid, and pain was upon them as the day of Egypt: for behold, it came.
{30:10} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: and I caused the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel.
{30:11} He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, being brought to destroy the land: and they emptied their swords upon Egypt, and they filled the land with the wounded.
{30:12} And I gave the rivers dryness and I sold the land, into the hand of the evil: and I made the land desolate, and its fulness by the hand, of strangers: I Jehovah spake.
{30:13} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And I destroyed the blocks, and I caused their nothings to cease from Noph; and a prince of the land of Egypt shall be no more: and I gave fear in the land of Egypt.
{30:14} And I made Pathros desolate, and I gave fire in Zoan, and I did judgments in No.
{30:15} And I poured out my wrath upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I cut off the multitude of No.
{30:16} And I gave fire in Egypt, and Sin writhing, shall be in pain, and No shall be for breaking in pieces, and Noph straits in the day.
{30:17} The young men of Aven and Pibeseth shall fall by the sword: and these shall go into captivity.
{30:18} And in Tahhapanes the day was darkened in my breaking there the rods of Egypt: and the pride of her strength ceased in her: she, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
{30:19} And I did judgments in Egypt; and they knew that am Jehovah.
{30:20} And it will be in the eleventh year, in the first, in the seventh to the month, the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
{30:21} Son of man, I broke the arm of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and behold, it not bound up to give healing, to put in bandages to bind it, to make it strong to hold upon the sword.
{30:22} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and I brake his arms, the strong, and the broken; and I caused the sword to fall from his hand.
{30:23} And I scattered Egypt among the nations, and I dispersed them in the lands.
{30:24} And I strengthened the arms of the king of Babel, and I gave my sword into his hand: and I brake the arms of Pharaoh, and he groaned the groanings of the wounded before his face.
{30:25} And I strengthened the arms of the king of Babel, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall; and they knew that I am Jehovah in my giving my sword into the hand of the king of Babel; and he stretched it out against the land of Egypt.
{30:26} And I scattered Egypt among the nations, and I dispersed them in the lands; and they knew that I am Jehovah.
{31:1} And it will be in the eleventh year, in the third, in one to the month, the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
{31:2} Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude: To whom wert thou like in thy greatness?
{31:3} Behold, Assur a cedar in Lebanon, fair of branch, and a shading thicket, and high of stature; and his foliage was between the thick boughs.
{31:4} The water made him great, the deep raised him up with her rivers going round about her planting, and she sent forth her channels to all the trees of the field.
{31:5} For this his height was lifted up more than all the trees of the field, and his boughs will be multiplied, and his branches will be extended from many waters, in his sending forth.
{31:6} And all the birds of the heavens nested in his boughs, and under his branches all the beasts of the field brought forth, and in his shadow dwelt all the great nations.
{31:7} And he was fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by many waters.
{31:8} The cedars did not hide him in the garden of God: the cypresses were not like to his boughs, and the plane trees were not as his branches; every tree in the garden of God was not like to him in his beauty.
{31:9} I made him fair by the multitude of his branches, and all the trees of Eden which are in the garden of God will envy him.
{31:10} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because thou wert lifted up in height, and he will give his foliage between the thick boughs, and his heart was lifted up in his height;
{31:11} And I will give him into the hand of the God of the nations; he shall do his doing to him: I drove him out for his injustice.
{31:12} And strangers, the terrible of the nations, shall cut him off and cast him down: upon the mountains and in all the galleys his branches fell, and his boughs shall be broken by all the torrents of the land; and all the people of the land shall go down from his shadow, and will cast him down.
{31:13} Upon his fall shall all the fowls of the heavens sit, and upon his branches were all the beasts of the field:
{31:14} So that all the trees of the waters shall not be lifted up in height, and they shall not give their foliage between the thick boughs, and all they drinking water shall not stand upon them in their height: for they all were given to death, to the earth underneath, in the midst of the sons of man, to those going down to the pit.
{31:15} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the day of his going down to hades caused to mourn: I covered the deep over him, and I shall restrain its floods, and many waters shall be withheld: and I will cause Lebanon to be darkened for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
{31:16} From the voice of his fall I caused the nations to tremble, in my causing him to go down to hades with those going down to the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and good of Lebanon, all drinking water and they shall be comforted in the earth underneath.
{31:17} They also went down with him to hades, to those being wounded with the sword; and his arm they dwelt in his shadow in the midst of the nations.
{31:18} To whom wert thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Men? and thou wert brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth underneath: in the midst of the uncircumcised thou shalt lie, with the wounded of the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.
{32:1} And it will be in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in one to the month, the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
{32:2} Son of man, lift up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, Thou wert like a young lion of the nations, and thou as a whale in the seas: and thou wilt break forth with thy rivers, and trouble the waters with thy feet, and thou wilt tread their rivers.
{32:3} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: and I spread my net over thee with a convocation of many peoples; and they brought thee up in my net.
{32:4} And I cast thee down upon the earth, upon the face of the field will I throw thee, and I caused all the birds of the heavens to sit upon thee, and I satiated from thee the beasts of all the earth.
{32:5} And I gave thy flesh upon the mountains, and I filled the valleys with thy height.
{32:6} And I watered the earth with thine inundation from thy blood, to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full from thee.
{32:7} And I covered the heavens in my quenching thee, and I darkened their stars; and I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not enlighten with its light.
{32:8} All the luminaries of light in the heavens I will darken them over thee, and I gave darkness upon thy land, says the Lord Jehovah.
{32:9} And I irritated the heart of many peoples in my bringing thy breaking among the nations, upon lands which ye knew not.
{32:10} And I caused many peoples to be astonished over thee, and kings shall shudder with shuddering over thee in my brandishing my sword over their faces; and they trembled at the moments each for his soul in the day of thy fall.
{32:11} For thus said the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babel shall come into thee.
{32:12} By the swords of the strong will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they destroyed the pride of Egypt, and all her multitude were destroyed.
{32:13} And I destroyed all her cattle above many waters; and the foot of man shall not trouble them any more, and the hoofs of cattle shall not trouble them.
{32:14} Then will I cause their waters to subside, and I will cause their rivers to go as oil, says the Lord Jehovah.
{32:15} In my giving the land of Egypt a desolation, and the land was desolate from her fulness in my striking all dwelling in it; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
{32:16} This the lamentation and the daughters of the nations lamented her: they shall lament her for Egypt, and for all her multitude they shall lament her, says the Lord Jehovah.
{32:17} And it will be in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth to the month, the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
{32:18} Son of man, Wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast it down, her, and the daughters of the powerful nations, to the earth underneath, with those going down to the pit.
{32:19} Above whom wert thou lovely? go down, and lie with the uncircumcised.
{32:20} In the midst of the wounded of the sword shall they fall: she was given to the sword: do ye draw her out and all her multitude.
{32:21} The strong of the mighty shall say to him from the midst of hades with his helpers: they went down; they lay uncircumcised, wounded of the sword.
{32:22} Assur there and all her convocation; his graves round about him: all of them wounded, fallen by the sword.
{32:23} Whose graves were given in the thighs of the pit, and her convocation will be round about her grave; all of them wounded, fallen by the sword, who gave terror in the land of the living.
{32:24} There Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them wounded, fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised to the earth underneath, who gave their terror in the land of the living; and they will bear their shame with those going down to the pit.
{32:25} In the midst of the wounded they gave a bed to her with all her multitude: her graves round about him; all of them uncircumcised, wounded of the sword: for their terror was given in the land of the living, and they shall bear their shame with those going down to the pit: he was given into the midst of the wounded.
{32:26} There Meshech and Tubal and all dyer multitude: round about him her graves: all of them uncircumcised, wounded of the sword, for they gave their terror in the land of the living.
{32:27} And they shall not lie with the strong fallen of the uncircumcised, who went down to hades with the weapons of their war: and they will give their swords under their heads, and their iniquities shall be upon their bones for the terror of the strong in the land of the living.
{32:28} And thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and thou shalt lie with the wounded of the sword.
{32:29} There Edom, her kings and all her princes who were given with their strength with the wounded of the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with those going down to the pit.
{32:30} There the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians who went down with the wounded; with their terror being ashamed of their strength; and they shall lie uncircumcised with the wounded of the sword, and bear their shame with those going down to the pit.
{32:31} Pharaoh shall see them, and he was comforted over all her multitude wounded of the sword, Pharaoh and all his army, says the Lord Jehovah.
{32:32} For I gave his terror in the land of the living: and he lay down in the midst of the uncircumcised with the wounded of the sword, Pharaoh and all her multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.
{33:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{33:2} Son of man, speak to the sons of thy people and say to them, A land, when I shall bring the sword upon her, and the people of the land took one man from their extremities, and they gave him to them for a watchman.
{33:3} And he saw the sword coming upon the land, and he struck upon the trumpet and warned the people;
{33:4} And he hearing, heard the voice of the trumpet, and he took not warning; and the sword will come and take him away; his blood shall be upon his head.
{33:5} He heard the voice of the trumpet, and he took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. He taking warning delivered his soul.
{33:6} And if the watchman shall see the sword coming, and he struck not upon the trumpet, and the people were not warned; and the sword shall come and take a soul from them, he was taken away in his iniquity, and his blood I will seek from the watchman's hand.
{33:7} And thou son of man, I gave thee a watchman to the house of Israel; and thou heardest the word from my mouth, and thou didst warn them from me.
{33:8} In my saying to the, unjust, O unjust one, dying, thou shalt die; and thou spakest not to warn the unjust from his way, that unjust one shall die in his iniquity, and I will seek his blood from thine hand.
{33:9} And thou, if thou warnedst the unjust from his way to turn back from it, and be turned not back from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; and thou didst deliver thy soul.
{33:10} And thou son of man, say to the house of Israel: Thus ye said, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pining away in them, and how shall we live?
{33:11} Say to them, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if I shall delight in the death of the unjust; but in the turning back of the unjust one from his way, and he lived: turn back, turn back from your evil ways: and wherefore will ye die, O house of Israel?
{33:12} And thou, son of man, say to the sons of my people, The justice of the just shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: and the injustice of the unjust, he shall not stumble in it in the day of his turning back from his injustice; and the just shall not be able to live in the day of his sinning.
{33:13} In my saying to the just, living, he shall live; and he trusted upon his justice, and he did evil, all his justice shall not be remembered; and in his iniquity which he did he shall die in it.
{33:14} And in my saying to the unjust, Dying, thou shalt die; and he turned back from his sinning and he did judgment and justice;
{33:15} The unjust shall turn back the pledge he shall restore the spoil, going in the laws of the living not to do evil; living, he shall live, he shall not die.
{33:16} All his sins which he sinned shall not be remembered to him: he did judgment and justice; living, he shall live.
{33:17} And the sons of my people said, The way of Jehovah will not make even: and they their way shall not make even.
{33:18} In the turning back of the just from his justice and doing iniquity, he shall die in them.
{33:19} And in the turning back of the unjust from his injustice and doing judgment and justice upon them, he shall live.
{33:20} And ye said, The way of Jehovah will not make even. I will judge you each according to his ways, O house of Israel.
{33:21} And it will be in the twelfth year, in the tenth, in the fifth to the month, to our captivity, he having escaped from Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city was struck.
{33:22} And the hand of Jehovah was to me in the evening, before he having escaped came; and he opened my mouth till he came to me in the morning; and he will open my mouth and I was no more dumb.
{33:23} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{33:24} Son of man, they inhabiting these wastes upon the land of Israel say, saying, Abraham was one, and he will inherit the land: and we are many; the land was given to us for a possession.
{33:25} For this, say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Ye will eat with the bloods, and ye will lift up your eyes to your blocks, and ye will pour out blood: and shall ye possess the land?
{33:26} Ye stood upon your sword, ye did abomination, and ye defiled each his neighbor's wife: and shall ye possess the land?
{33:27} Thus shalt thou say to them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I live if not they who are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and he who is upon the face of the field I gave him to the beast to eat him, and they who are in the fastnesses and in caves shall die by death.
{33:28} And I gave the land a desolation and an amazement, and I caused the pride of her strength to cease; and the mountains of Israel were desolate from none passing through.
{33:29} And they shall know that I am Jehovah in my giving the land a desolation and an astonishment for all their abominations which they did.
{33:30} And thou son of man, the sons of my people are speaking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speaking one to another, a man to his brother, saying, Come now and hear what the word coming forth from Jehovah.
{33:31} And they will come to thee, according to the coming of the people, and they will sit before thee my people, and they heard thy words, and they did them not: for they making loves with their mouth, their heart went after their plunder.
{33:32} And behold thee to them as song of loves of a fair voice, playing well an instrument: and they heard thy words and did them not.
{33:33} And in its coming (behold, it came) and they shall know that a prophet was in the midst of them.
{34:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{34:2} Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to them, To the shepherds, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo! to the shepherds of Israel who were feeding themselves: shall not the shepherds feed the sheep?
{34:3} Ye will eat the fat, and ye will put on the wool, ye will sacrifice the fatlings: ye will not feed the sheep.
{34:4} Ye strengthened not the sickly, and the diseased ye healed not, and the broken ye bound not up, and the thrust away ye turned not back, and the lost ye sought not; and with force and with oppression ye ruled them.
{34:5} And they will be scattered from Without a shepherd: and they will be for consuming to all the beasts of the field, and they will be scattered.
{34:6} My sheep will wander upon all the mountains, and upon every high hill: and upon all the face of the earth my flock was scattered, and none searching and none seeking.
{34:7} For this, hear ye shepherds, the word of Jehovah:
{34:8} I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if not my sheep were for plunder and my sheep will be for consuming to all the beasts of the field from no shepherd; and the shepherds sought not my sheep, and the shepherds will feed themselves, and my sheep they fed not.
{34:9} For this, hear ye shepherds, the word of Jehovah:
{34:10} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against the shepherds; and I sought my flock from their hand, and I caused them to cease from feeding the sheep: and the shepherds shall no more feed themselves; and I delivered my flock from their face, and they shall not be to them for consuming.
{34:11} For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me. I also sought my sheep, and I searched them out.
{34:12} According to the seeking of the shepherd of his flock in the day of his being in the midst of his sheep being scattered; so will I search out my sheep and deliver them from all places where they were scattered there in the day of cloud and darkness.
{34:13} And I brought them out from the peoples, and I gathered them from the lands, and I brought them to their land, and I fed them upon the mountains of Israel by the torrents, and in all the dwellings of the earth.
{34:14} In a good pasture will I feed them, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall be their rest: there shall they lie in a good rest, and a fat pasture they shall feed upon the mountains of Israel.
{34:15} I will feed my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, says the Lord Jehovah.
{34:16} The lost I will seek out, and the thrust away I will turn back, and to the broken I will bind up, and the diseased I will strengthen: and the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed them with judgment.
{34:17} And ye, my sheep, thus said the Lord Jehovah; Behold me judging between sheep to sheep, to the rams and to the he goats.
{34:18} Is it small for you ye will feed the good pasture, and the remainder of your pastures ye will tread down with your feet? and ye will drink front the settled waters and that being left they will tread with your feet.
{34:19} And my sheep will feed of the trodden down of your feet; and they will drink of the treading of your feet.
{34:20} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah to them: Behold me I also judged between fat sheep and between lean sheep.
{34:21} Because with side and with shoulder ye will thrust away, and with your horns ye pushed all the sickly till that ye scattered them without;
{34:22} And I saved my sheep, and they shall no more be for plunder; and I judged between sheep to sheep.
{34:23} And I raised up one shepherd over them, and he fed them, my servant David; he shall feed them and he shall be to them for shepherd.
{34:24} I Jehovah will be to them for God, and my servant David a prince in the midst of them; I Jehovah spake.
{34:25} And I cut out to them a covenant of peace, and I caused the evil beast to cease from the land: and they dwelt with confidence in the desert, and they slept in the forests.
{34:26} And I gave them and round about my hill a blessing; and I brought down the rain in its time, and they shall be rains of blessing.
{34:27} And the tree of the field gave its fruit, and the land shall give her produce, and they shall be upon their land with confidence, and they knew that I am Jehovah in my breaking the rods of their yoke; and I delivered them from the hand of those serving themselves in them.
{34:28} And they shall no more be plunder to the nations, and the beast of the earth shall not eat them; and they dwelt confidently and none making afraid.
{34:29} And I raised up to them a plant for a name, and they shall be no more taken away by famine in the land, and they shall no more bear the shame of the nations.
{34:30} And they knew that I Jehovah their God with them, and they my people, the house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.
{34:31} And ye my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, ye are men, I your God, says the Lord Jehovah.
{35:1} And the word of the Lord will be to me, saying,
{35:2} Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it.
{35:3} And say to it, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against thee, O mount Seir; and I stretched out my hand upon thee a desolation and an amazement.
{35:4} I will set thy cities a waste, and thou shalt be a desolation, and thou knewest that I am Jehovah.
{35:5} Because there was a perpetual enmity to thee, and thou wilt pour out the sons of Israel by the hands of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of iniquity the end:
{35:6} For this, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, for I will make thee for blood and blood shall pursue thee: since thou hatedst not blood, and blood shall pursue thee.
{35:7} And I gave mount Seir for a desolation, and desolation, and I cut off from it him passing through and him turning back.
{35:8} And I filled his mountains with his wounded: in thy hills and in thy valleys, and all thy torrents the wounded of the sword shall fall in them:
{35:9} I will give thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not be inhabited: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
{35:10} Because of thy saying, The two nations and the two lands shall be to me, and we will possess it; and Jehovah was there:
{35:11} For this, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, and I did according to thine anger and according to thine envy which thou didst in thy hatred against them; and I was known among them according to that I will judge thee.
{35:12} And thou knewest that I am Jehovah; I heard all thy reproaches which thou spakest against the mountains of Israel, saying, They were given to us a desolation to consume.
{35:13} And ye will be magnified against me with your mouth, and ye multiplied your words against me: I heard.
{35:14} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: When all the earth rejoiced I will make thee a desolation.
{35:15} For thy rejoicing at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was a desolation, thus will I do to thee: thou shalt be a desolation O mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
{36:1} And thou son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah:
{36:2} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy said against you, Aha! and the heights of old were for a possession to us:
{36:3} For this, prophesy and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because for, because of making desolate, and panting after you from round about, for you to be a possession for the remainder of the nations, and ye will come up upon the lips of the tongue and a slander of the people:
{36:4} For this ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the torrents and to the valleys, and to the desolate wastes, and to cities being forsaken which were for plunder and for derision to the rest of the nations that are from round about;
{36:5} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: If not in the fire of my jealousy I spake against the rest of the nations and against all Edom who gave my land to them for a possession with joy of all the heart, with contempt of soul for casting it out for plunder.
{36:6} For this, prophesy against the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, and to the torrents and to the valleys, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me, in my jealousy and in my wrath did I speak because ye bore the shame of the nations.
{36:7} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: I lifted up my hand; if not the nations who are from round about to you, they shall bear their shame.
{36:8} And ye mountains of Israel, ye shall give your branch, and ye shall bear your fruit to my people Israel; for they drew near to come.
{36:9} For behold me for you, and I turned to you and ye were tilled and sown.
{36:10} And I multiplied man upon you, all the house of Israel, all of it: and the cities were inhabited and the wastes shall be built.
{36:11} And I multiplied upon you man and cattle; and they multiplied and were fruitful: and I caused you to dwell according to your former times, and I did good above your beginnings: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
{36:12} And I caused man to go upon you, my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou wert to them for an inheritance, and thou shalt no more add to bereave them.
{36:13} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of their saying to you, Thou didst consume man, and thou wert bereaving thy nations.
{36:14} For this, thou shalt no more consume man, and thou shalt no more bereave thy nation; says the Lord Jehovah.
{36:15} And I will no more cause to be heard in thee the shame of the nations, and thou shalt bear no more the reproach of the peoples, and thou shalt no more bereave thy nations, says the Lord Jehovah.
{36:16} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{36:17} Son of man, the house of Israel dwelling upon their land, and they will defile it with their way and with their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of her set apart.
{36:18} And I will pour out my wrath upon them upon the blood which they poured out upon the land, and they defiled it by their blocks:
{36:19} And I will scatter them among the nations, and they shall be dispersed in the lands: according to their ways and according to their doings, I judged them.
{36:20} And he will come to the nations where they came in there, and they will profane my holy name in saying to them, These the people of Jehovah, and they went forth from their land.
{36:21} And I will spare for my holy name that the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they went there.
{36:22} For this, say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I do not for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name which ye profaned among the nations where ye went there.
{36:23} And I consecrated my great name, being profaned among the nations which ye profaned, in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, says the Lord Jehovah, in my being consecrated among you before your eyes.
{36:24} And I took you from the nations and I gathered you from all the lands, and I brought you into your land.
{36:25} And I sprinkled clean waters upon you, and ye were cleansed: from all your uncleannesses and from all your blocks will I cleanse you.
{36:26} And I gave to you a new heart, and a new spirit will I give in the midst of you: and I turned away your heart of stone from your flesh, and I gave to you an heart of flesh.
{36:27} And my spirit I will, give in the midst of you, and I made that ye shall go in my laws, and my judgments shall ye watch and do.
{36:28} And ye dwelt in the land which I gave to your fathers, and ye were to me for a people, and I shall be to you for God.
{36:29} And I saved you from all your uncleannesses: and I called for the grain and I multiplied it, and I will not give famine upon you.
{36:30} And I multiplied the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field, so that ye shall no more take the reproach of famine among the nations.
{36:31} And ye remembered your evil ways and your doings which not being good, and ye loathed with your faces for your iniquities and for your abominations.
{36:32} I did not for your sakes, says the Lord Jehovah, it shall be known to you: be ashamed and be disgraced for your ways, O house of Israel.
{36:33} Thus said the Lord Jehovah; In the day of my cleansing you from all your iniquities, and I caused the cities to be inhabited, and the walls were built.
{36:34} And the desolate land shall be worked instead of its being a desolation before the eyes of all passing by.
{36:35} And they said: This land being desolate was as the garden of Eden: and the cities laid waste and desolated and destroyed, being fortified, were inhabited.
{36:36} And the nations which shall be left round about you shall know that I Jehovah built the destroyed, I planted the desolated: I Jehovah spake, and I did.
{36:37} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Yet this will I be sought out to the house of Israel, to do to them; I will multiply them with men as sheep.
{36:38} As holy sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem in her appointments; thus shall the cities laid waste be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
{37:1} The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he will bring me forth in the spirit of Jehovah, and he will set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was filled with bones.
{37:2} And he caused me to pass over them round about, round about: and behold, exceeding many upon the face of the valley; and behold, exceedingly dry.
{37:3} And he will say to me, Son of man, shall these bones live? And saying, Thou Lord Jehovah knoweth.
{37:4} And he will say to me, Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.
{37:5} Thus said the Lord Jehovah to these bones: Behold, I bring upon you the spirit, and ye lived.
{37:6} And I gave sinews upon you, and I brought up flesh upon you, and I drew skin over you, and I gave spirit in you, and ye lived; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
{37:7} And I prophesied as I was commanded: and there will be a voice as I prophesied, and behold a shaking, the bones will draw near, bone to his bone.
{37:8} And I saw and behold, upon them sinews and flesh came up, and the skin will draw over them from above: and no spirit in them.
{37:9} And he will say to me, prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O wind and blow upon these slain, and they shall live.
{37:10} And I prophesied as he commanded me, and the spirit will come upon them and they will live, and they will stand upon their feet, an army great, exceedingly, exceedingly.
{37:11} And he will say to me, Son of man, these bones all the house of Israel: behold them saying, Our bones were dried up, and our hope perished, and we were cut off to us.
{37:12} For this, prophesy and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I opened your graves and brought you up from your graves, O my people, and I brought you to the land of Israel.
{37:13} And ye knew that I was Jehovah in my opening your graves and in my bringing you up from your graves, O my People.
{37:14} And I gave my spirit in you, and ye lived, and I caused you to rest upon your land: and ye knew that I Jehovah spake, and I did, says the Lord Jehovah.
{37:15} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{37:16} And thou son of man, take to thee one tree and write upon it, For Judah, and for the sons of Israel his company: and take one tree and write upon it, For Joseph, the tree of Ephraim, and all the house of Israel his company:
{37:17} And draw them near one to one to thee, for one tree; and they were for one in thine hand.
{37:18} And when the sons of thy people shall say to thee, saying, Wilt thou not announce to us what these to thee?
{37:19} Speak to them, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold I take the tree of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his company, and I gave them upon him with the tree of Judah, and ye made them for one tree, and they were one in my hand.
{37:20} And the trees which thou shalt write upon them were in thy hand before their eyes.
{37:21} And speak to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they went there, and I gathered them from round about, and I brought them to their land:
{37:22} And I made them for one nation in the land in the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be to them all for king: and they shall no more be for two nations, and they shall no more be divided into two kingdoms at all.
{37:23} And they shall no more be defiled with their blocks and with their abominable things, and in all their transgressions: and I saved them from all their dwellings where they sinned in them, and I cleansed them: and they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God.
{37:24} And my servant David a king over them; and one shepherd shall be to all of them: and in my judgments they shall go and they shall watch my laws and do them.
{37:25} And they shall dwell upon the land which I gave to my servant to Jacob which your fathers dwelt upon it, and they shall dwell upon it, they and their sons and their sons' sons, even to forever: and David my servant a prince to them forever.
{37:26} And I cut out to them a covenant of peace; it shall be an eternal covenant with them: and I gave them, and I multiplied them, and I gave my holy place in the midst of them forever.
{37:27} And my dwelling was with them, and I was to them for God, and they shall be to me for a people.
{37:28} And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah consecrating Israel in my holy place, being in the midst of them forever.
{38:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{38:2} Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the head prince of Meeheoh and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
{38:3} And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against thee, O Gog, head prince of the head of Meshech and Tubal:
{38:4} And I turned thee back, and I gave hooks in thy jaw bones, and I brought thee forth and all thine army of horses and horsemen, clothed in perfection, all of them a great convocation with buckler and shield, holding swords all of them:
{38:5} Persia, Cush and Phut with them, all of them with shield and helmet.
{38:6} Gomer and all his hosts; the house of Togarmah of the thighs of the north, and all his hosts: many peoples with thee.
{38:7} Be prepared, and be prepared for thyself, thou, and all thy convocation convoked together to thee, and be to them for watching.
{38:8} From many days thou shalt be reviewed: in the last of the years thou shalt come to the land turned back from the sword, being gathered from many peoples upon the mountains of Israel, which were continually for waste: and she was brought forth from the peoples, and they dwelt confidently all of them.
{38:9} Ascending, thou shalt come as a storm, as a cloud to cover the earth shalt thou be and all thy hosts, and many peoples with thee.
{38:10} Thus said the Lord Jehovah and it was in that day words will come up upon thy heart, and thou purposed an evil purpose:
{38:11} And thou saidst, I will come up upon the land of the open country; I will go to those being at rest, dwelling confidently, all of them dwelling without a wall, and bar and doors not to them,
{38:12} To spoil a spoil and to plunder a plunder; to turn back thy hand upon the wastes being inhabited, and upon the people being gathered out of the nations making cattle and substance, dwelling upon the summit of the land.
{38:13} Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish, and all her young lions, they shall say to thee, For spoiling a spoil art thou come? For plundering a plunder didst thou call together thy convocation? to lift up silver and gold, to take cattle and substance, to spoil a great spoil?
{38:14} For this, prophesy, O son of man, and say to Gog, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In that day in my people Israel dwelling confidently, shalt thou not know?
{38:15} And thou earnest out of the places from the thighs of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, riding horses all of them, a great convocation and much strength:
{38:16} And coming up upon my people Israel as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the last of the days, and brought thee forth against my land, for the nations to know me in my being consecrated in thee before their eyes, O Gog.
{38:17} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Art thou he of whom I spake in days of old by the hand of my servants the prophets of Israel, prophesying in those days years to bring thee against them?
{38:18} And it was in that day, in the day Gog came upon the land of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, my wrath shall come up in my face.
{38:19} And in my jealousy, in the fire of my wrath I spake, If not in that day shall be a great shaking upon the land of Israel.
{38:20} And from my face shall shake the fish of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and every creeping thing creeping upon the earth, and every man which is upon the face of the earth; and the mountains were overthrown, and the precipices fell, and every wall shall fall to the earth.
{38:21} And I called to all my mountains a sword against him, says the Lord Jehovah: and the sword of each shall be against his brother.
{38:22} And I will contend with him with death and with blood; and an overflowing rain, and hailstones, fire and sulphur will I rain upon him and upon his hosts, and upon many peoples which are with him.
{38:23} And I magnified myself, and I consecrated myself; and I was made known to the eyes of many nations, and they knew that I am Jehovah.
{39:1} And thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against thee, O Gog, prince of the head of Meshech and Tubal:
{39:2} And I turned thee back, and I led thee, and I caused thee to come up from the thighs of the north, and I brought thee upon the mountains of Israel:
{39:3} And I struck thy bow out of thy left hand, and thine arrows will I cause to fall from thy right hand.
{39:4} Upon the mountains of Israel shalt thou fall, thou and all thy hosts, and the peoples which are with thee: to the ravenous bird, the bird of every wing, and to the beasts of the field I gave to consume.
{39:5} Upon the face of the field thou shalt fall: for I spake, says the Lord Jehovah.
{39:6} And I sent a fire upon Magog, and upon them dwelling with confidence in the islands: and they knew that I am Jehovah.
{39:7} And I will make known my holy name in the midst of my people Israel; and I will no more profane my holy name: and the nations shall know that am Jehovah, the Holy One in Israel.
{39:8} Behold, it came, and it was, says the Lord Jehovah; this the day which I spake.
{39:9} And they dwelling in the cities of Israel went forth and kindled and set on fire with the weapons and the shield and the buckler, with the bow and with the arrows, and with the rods of the hand and with the spear, and they burnt a fire with them seven years:
{39:10} And they shall not lift up wood from the field, and they shall not cut down from the forests; for they shall kindle fire with the weapons, and they spoiled those spoiling them, and they plundered those plundering them, says the Lord Jehovah.
{39:11} And it was in that day, I will give to Gog a place there, a sepulchre in Israel, the valley of those passing through east of the sea: and it stopped those passing by: and they buried there Gog, and all his multitude: and they called the valley, The Multitude.
{39:12} And the house of Israel buried them to cleanse the land seven months.
{39:13} And they buried all the people of the land: and it was to them for name the day of honoring me; says the Lord Jehovah.
{39:14} And they shall separate men continually, passing through in the land burying those transported with those remaining upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: from the end of seven months they shall search.
{39:15} And they caused to pass through, passed through in the land, and he seeing a bone of man and he built a pillar by it, they burying, buried it in the valley of the multitude of Gog.
{39:16} And also the name of the city, The Multitude. And they cleansed the land.
{39:17} And thou, son of man, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Say to the bird of every wing and to all the beasts of the field, Gather yourselves together, and come; assemble yourselves from round about to my sacrifice which I sacrifice to you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel; and ye ate flesh and drank blood.
{39:18} The flesh of the strong shall ye eat, and the blood of the princes of the earth shall ye drink, rams, lambs and he goats, bullocks being fattened, of Bashan all of them.
{39:19} And ye ate fat to satiety, and ye drank blood to drunkenness, from my sacrifice which I sacrificed for you.
{39:20} And ye were satiated at my table with horse and chariot, with the strong, and every man of war, says the Lord Jehovah.
{39:21} And I gave my honor among the nations, and all the nations saw my judgments which I did, and my hand that I put upon them.
{39:22} And the house of Israel knew that I am Jehovah their God, from this day and farther.
{39:23} And the nations shall know that for their iniquity the house of Israel were carried away captive: because they transgressed against me, and I will hide my face from them, and I will give them into the hand of their enemies, and they shall fall by the sword, all of them.
{39:24} According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I did with them, and I will hide my face from them.
{39:25} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Now will I turn back the captivity of Jacob, and I compassionated all the house of Israel, and I was jealous for my holy name.
{39:26} And they bare their shame and all their transgression which they transgressed against me, in their dwelling upon their land confidently, and none terrifying.
{39:27} In my turning them back from the peoples, and I gathered them from the lands of their enemies, and I was consecrated in them before the eyes of many nations;
{39:28} And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God in my carrying them captive to the nations: and I collected them into their land, and I will no more leave from them there.
{39:29} And I will no more bide my face from them, for I poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.
{40:1} In the twenty and fifth year to our captivity, in the beginning, of the year, in the tenth to the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was struck, in this very day the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he will bring me there.
{40:2} In the visions of God he brought me to the land of Israel, and he will set me down upon an exceeding high mountain, and upon it as the building of a city from the south.
{40:3} And he will bring me there, and behold, a man, his appearance as the appearance of brass, and a cord of flax in his hand, and a reed of measure; and he stood in the gate.
{40:4} And the man will speak to me, Son of man, see with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart to all which I cause thee to see; for in order to cause thee to see thou went brought hither: announce all which thou seest to the house of Israel.
{40:5} And behold a wall from without to the house round about, round about, and in the man's hand a reed of measure six cubits by the cubit, and a handbreadth: and he will measure the breadth of the building, one reed: and the height, one reed.

{42:5} And the upper cells shortened, for the offsets will prevail above these, from the lower and from the middle of the building:

{42:13} And he will say to me, The cells of the north, the cells of the south which are at the face of the separated place, they the cells of the holy place, where the priests shall eat there, that draw near to Jehovah, the holies of holies: there shall they set the holies of holies, and the gift, and the sin, and the trespass; for the place is holy.
{42:14} On the priests coming in, and they shall go not forth from the holy place to the enclosure without, and there they shall set their garments which they shall serve in them; for they are holy; they shall put on other garments, and approach to that for the people.
{42:15} And he finished the measure of the inner house, and he brought me forth the way of the gate whose face the way of the east, and he measured it round about, round about.

{42:19} He turned to the wind of the sea, he measured five hundred reeds by the reed of measure.
{42:20} To the four winds he measured it: the wall to it round about, round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to separate between the holy to the profane.
{43:1} And he will cause me to go to the gate, the gate whose face the way of the east.
{43:2} And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice as the voice of many waters; and the earth was illuminated from his glory.
{43:3} And as the appearance of the vision which I saw, as the vision which I saw in my coming to destroy the city: and the visions as the vision which I saw at the river Chebar; and I shall fall upon my face.
{43:4} And the glory of Jehovah came into the house the way of the gate which its face the way of the east.
{43:5} And the spirit will lift me up and bring me to the inner enclosure; behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
{43:6} And I shall hear him speaking to me from the house; and a man was standing by me.
{43:7} And he will say to me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I shall dwell there in the midst of the sons of Israel forever, and the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, they and their kings by their fornication, and by the corpses of their kings in their heights.
{43:8} In their giving their threshold with my thresholds, and their door-post by my door-posts, and the wall between me and between them, and they defiled my holy name with their abominations which they did: and consuming them in my anger.
{43:9} Now they shall put far off their fornication, and the corpses of their kings, from me, and I dwelt in the midst of them forever.
{43:10} Thou son of man, announce to the house of Israel, the house, and they shall be ashamed of their iniquities: and measure the structure.
{43:11} And if they were ashamed of all which they did, the form of the house and its structure, and all its goings out and all its comings in, and all its forms, and all its laws, and all its forms, and all its instructions, make known to them: and write before their eyes, and they shall watch all its instructions and all its laws, and do them.
{43:12} This the instruction of the house: Upon the head of the mountain all its bound round about, round about, holy of holies. Behold, this the instruction of the house.
{43:13} And these the measures of the altar by cubits: a cubit, a cubit and a hand-breadth; and the bosom, a cubit and a cubit the breadth; and its bound to its lip round about, one span: and this the back of the altar.
{43:14} And from the bosom of the earth even to the lower terrace, two cubits, and the breadth, one cubit; and from the small terrace even to the great terrace, four cubits, and the breadth, the cubit.
{43:15} And the mountain of God, four cubits; and from the lion of God and upwards, four horns.
{43:16} And the lion of God, twelve the length by twelve the breadth; four square to its four squares.
{43:17} And the terrace, fourteen the length by fourteen the breadth, to its four squares; and the bound round about it half a cubit, and the bosom to it, a cubit round about; and its steps turning east.
{43:18} And he will say to me, Son of man, thus said the Lord Jehovah: These the laws of the altar in the day of Making it to bring up a burnt-offering upon it, and to sprinkle upon it blood.
{43:19} And give to the priests the Levites, those which are of the seed of Zadok, drawing near to me, says the Lord Jehovah, to save me, a bullock, son of a cow, for sin.
{43:20} And take from its blood and give upon its four horns, and to the four corners of the terrace, and to the border round about: and cleanse it and expiate it.
{43:21} And take the bullock of the sin and burn it in the appointed place of the house from without to the holy place.
{43:22} And in the second day thou shalt bring near a kid of the goats complete for sin; and cleanse ye the altar as they cleansed for the bullock.
{43:23} In thy finishing the cleansing thou shalt bring a bullock, son of a cow, blameless, and a blameless ram front the sheep;
{43:24} And bring them near before Jehovah, and the priests cast salt upon them, and they brought them up a burnt-offering to Jehovah.
{43:25} Seven days thou shalt do a he goat of sin for the day, and a bullock, son of a cow, and a ram from the sheep, blameless, shall they do.
{43:26} Seven days and they expiated the altar, and they cleansed it; and they filled his hand.
{43:27} And they finished the days, and it was in the eighth day and forward, the priests will do your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace: and I received you into favor, says the Lord Jehovah.
{44:1} And he turned me back the way of the gate of the holy place with out, looking to the east; and it was shut.
{44:2} And Jehovah will say to me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and a man shall not come in through it; because Jehovah God of Israel came in through it and it was shut.
{44:3} The prince, the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before Jehovah; from the way of the porch of the gate he will go in, and from its way he went out.
{44:4} And he will bring me the way of the gate of the north to the face of the house: and I shall see, and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah: and I shall fall upon my face.
{44:5} And Jehovah will say to me, Son of man, set thy heart, and see with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all which I speak to thee concerning all the laws of the house of Jehovah, and concerning all its instructions; and set thy heart to the entering of the house, and all the goings out of the holy place.
{44:6} And thou shalt say to the perverse to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Enough for you of all your abominations, O house of Israel.
{44:7} In your bringing in the sons of the stranger, uncircumcised of heart and uncircumcised of flesh, to be in my holy place to profane it, my house, in your bringing near my bread, the fat and the blood, and they will break my covenant by all your abominations.
{44:8} And ye watched not the watches of my holy place: and ye set for watching of my watches in my holy place for yourselves.
{44:9} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Every son of the stranger, uncircumcised of heart and uncircumcised of flesh, shall not come in to my holy place, to every son of the stranger which is the midst of the sons of Israel.
{44:10} But the Levites who went far off from me, in the going astray of Israel who went astray from me after the blocks; and they bare their iniquity.
{44:11} And they were serving in my holy place, reviewing at the gates of the house, and serving the house: they shall slaughter the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to serve them.
{44:12} Because they will serve them before their blocks, and they were to the house of Israel for a stumbling block of iniquity; for this I lifted up my hand against them, says the Lord Jehovah, and they bare their iniquity.
{44:13} And they shall not come near to me to be priest to me, to come near all my holy things, to the holies of holies: and they bare their shame, and their abominations which they did.
{44:14} And I gave them watchers of the watches of the house for all its service, and for all which shall be done in it.
{44:15} And the priests the Levites, sons of Zadok, who watched the watches of my holy place in the going astray of the sons of Israel from me, they shall draw near to me to serve me, and they stood before me to bring near to me the fat and the blood, says the Lord Jehovah:
{44:16} They shall come into my holy place, and they shall draw near to my table, to serve me; and they watched my watches.
{44:17} And it was in their going in to the gates of the inner enclosure they shall put on linen garments; and wool shall not come up upon them in their serving in the gates of the inner enclosure, and the house.
{44:18} And linen turbans shall be upon their heads, and linen drawers shall be upon their loins; and they shall not be girded with sweat.
{44:19} And in their going forth to the enclosure without, to the enclosure to the people, they shall lay off their garments which they serve in them, and set them in the cells of the holy place, and put on other garments; and they shall not consecrate the people in their garments.
{44:20} And they shall not shave their heads, and shearing, they shall shear their beads.
{44:21} And they shall not drink wine every priest in their going in to the inner enclosure.
{44:22} And they Shall not take a widow and her thrust away, to them for wives: but virgins from the seed of the house of Israel, and a widow which shall be a widow from a priest, shall they take.
{44:23} And they shall point out to my people between the holy to the profane, and they shall cause them to know between the unclean to the clean.
{44:24} And upon contention they shall stand to judge in my judgments, and they judged: and my instructions and my laws in all my appointments, they shall watch; and my Sabbaths shall they consecrate.
{44:25} And to a dead man they shall not come to be defiled: but for father and for mother, and for son and for daughter, for brother, for sister who was not to a husband, they shall be defiled.
{44:26} And after his cleansing they shall number to him seven days.
{44:27} And in the day of his going into the holy place, to the inner court he serve in the holy place, he shall bring near his sin, says the Lord Jehovah.
{44:28} And it was to them for an inheritance; I am their inheritance: and a possession ye shall not give to there in Israel: I am their possession.
{44:29} The gift and the sin and the trespass shall they eat; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be to them.
{44:30} And the first of all the first-fruits of all, and every oblation of all from all your oblations, shall be for the priests: and the first of your grouts ye shall give to the priest to cause blessing to rest upon thy house.
{44:31} Every carcass or torn from bind and from cattle, the priests shall not eat.
{45:1} And in your causing the land to fall in inheritance, ye shall lift up an oblation to Jehovah, holiness from the land: the length, five and twenty thousand the length; and the breadth, ten thousand: it is holy in all its bounds round about.
{45:2} There shall be from this to the holy place five hundred, by five being square round about; and fifty cubits the area to it round about.
{45:3} And from this measure thou shalt measure the length, five and twenty thousand, and the breadth, ten thousand: and in it shall be the holy plate, the holy of holies.
{45:4} A holy place from the land this shall be to the priests serving the holy place drawing near to serve Jehovah: and it was to them a place for their houses and a holy place for the holy place.
{45:5} And five and twenty thousand the length, and ten thousand the breadth, shall be to the Levites serving the house to them for a possession of twenty cells.
{45:6} And ye shall give the possession of the city, five thousand the breadth, and the length, five and twenty thousand, over against the oblation of the holy place: it shall be to all the house of Israel.
{45:7} And for the prince from this, and from this to the oblation of the holy place, and to the possession of the city, at the face of the oblation of the holy place, and at the face of the possession of the city from the side of the sea, the ass, and from the side of the east to the east: and the length over against one of the portions from the bound of the sea to the bound of the east,
{45:8} In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
{45:9} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Enough to you, O princes of Israel: remove ye violence and oppression, and do judgment and justice, lift up your expulsions from off my people, says the Lord Jehovah.
{45:10} A just balance, and a just ephah, and a just bath, shall be to you.
{45:11} The ephah and the bath shall be one measure, for the bath to lift up the tenth of the homer, and the ephah the tenth of the homer: to the homer shall it be from its measure.
{45:12} And the shekel twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels the maneh shall be to you.
{45:13} This the oblation which ye shall lift up: the sixth of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and give the sixth of an ephah of an homer of barley.
{45:14} And the law of oil, the bath of oil, the tenth of the bath from the cor, ten baths the homer, for ten baths are the homer.
{45:15} And one sheep from the flock out of two hundred, out of the well watered region of Israel, for a gift and for the burnt-offering, and for the peace to expiate for them, says the Lord Jehovah.
{45:16} All the people of the land shall be for this oblation for the prince in Israel.
{45:17} And for the prince it shall be the burnt-offerings, and the gift, and the libation, in the festivals and in the new moons, and in the Sabbaths, and in all the appointments of the house of Israel: he shall do the sin, and the gift, and the burnt-offering, and the peace to expiate for the house of Israel.
{45:18} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the first, in one to the month, thou shalt take a bullock, son of a cow, blameless, and cleanse the holy place:
{45:19} And the priest took of the blood of the sin and gave upon the door-posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the terrace, to the altar and upon the door-posts of the gate of the inner enclosure.
{45:20} And thus shalt thou do in the seventh to the month, from each going astray and from the simple: and ye expiated the house.
{45:21} In the first, in the fourteenth day in the month, the passover shall be to you the festival of seven days; unleavened shall be eaten.
{45:22} And in that day the prince did for himself and for all the people of the land the bullock of sin.
{45:23} And seven days of the festival he shall do a burnt-offering to Jehovah, seven bullocks and seven rams blameless for the day, seven days; and the sin a he goat of the goats for the day.
{45:24} And the gift an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram shall he do, and oil, an hin to the ephah.
{45:25} In the seventh, in the fifteenth day to the month, in the festival shall he do according to these things, seven days, according to the sin, according to the burnt-offering; and according to the gift and according to the oil.
{46:1} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner enclosure turning to the east shall be shut six days of work; and in the day of the Sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
{46:2} And the prince went in the way of the porch of the gate from without, and he stood by the door-posts of the gate, and the priests did his burnt-offerings and his peace, and he worshiped upon the threshold of the gate, and he went forth: and the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
{46:3} And the people of the land worshiped at the door of that gate in the Sabbaths and in the new moons, before Jehovah.
{46:4} And the burnt-offering which the prince shall bring near to Jehovah in the day of the Sabbath, six blameless lambs, and a blameless ram.
{46:5} And the gift an ephah to a ram, a gift for the lambs the giving of his hand, and the oil, an hin to the ephah
{46:6} And in the day of the new moon, a blameless bullock, the son of a cow, and six lambs and a ram: they shall be blameless.
{46:7} And an ephah to the bullock and an ephah to a ram shall he do the gift, and to the lambs, according as his hand shall attain, and the oil, an hin to the ephah.
{46:8} And in the going in of the prince he shall go in the way of the porch of the gate, and in its way he shall go forth.
{46:9} And In the going in of the people of the land before Jehovah in the appointments, he going in the way of the gate of the north to worship, shall come forth the way of the gate of the south; and he going in the way of the gate of the south, shall come forth the way of the gate of the north: he shall not turn back the way which he came in it, but he shall come forth opposite to it.
{46:10} And the prince in the midst of them, in their going in, shall go in; and in their going forth, his going forth.
{46:11} And in the festivals and in the appointments the gift shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs the giving of his hand, and the oil, an bin to the ephah.
{46:12} And when the prince shall do a voluntary gift of a burnt-offering or peace a voluntary gift to Jehovah, and he opened to him the gate turning to the east, and he did his burnt-offering and his peace according as he will do in the day of the Sabbath: and he went forth and shut the gate after his going forth.
{46:13} And a blameless lamb the son of his year thou shalt do for a burnt-offering for the day to Jehovah: in the morning, by the morning, shalt thou do it.
{46:14} And thou shalt do the gift for it in the morning by the morning, the sixth of an ephah, and the oil, the third of an hin, to sprinkle the fine flour; a gift to Jehovah a law forever, continually.
{46:15} And prepare ye the lamb and the gift, and the oil, in the morning, by the morning, a burnt-offering continually.
{46:16} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: If the prince shall give a gift to a man of his sons, of his inheritance, it shall be to his sons; this their possession by inheritance.
{46:17} And if he shall give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, and it was to him until the year of liberty; and it turned back to the prince: but his inheritance his sons'; to them it shall be.
{46:18} And the prince shall not take of the inheritance of the people to oppress them, from their possession; from his possession he shall cause his sons to inherit, so that my people shall not be scattered each from his possession.
{46:19} And he will bring me through the entrance which is by the shoulder of the gate, into the cells of the holy place, to the priests, turning to the north: and behold, there a place upon the two thighs of the sea.
{46:20} And he will say to me, This the place where the priests shall boil there the trespass and the sin, where they shall cook the gift; not to bring forth to the enclosure without to consecrate the people.
{46:21} And he will bring me forth to the enclosure without, and he will cause me to pass through to the four angles of the enclosure; and behold, an enclosure in an angle of the enclosure; an enclosure in an angle of the enclosure.
{46:22} In the four angles of the enclosure, enclosures shut up, forty the length and thirty the breadth: one measure to these four angles.
{46:23} And a wall round about in them, round about to them four, and boiling places made from under the walls round about.
{46:24} And he will say to me, These the house of those boiling where those serving the house shall boil there the sacrifice of the people.
{47:1} And he will turn me back to the door of the house; and behold, waters coming forth from under the threshold of the house to the east: for the face of the house eastward, and the waters coming down from under from the right shoulder of the house, from the south to the altar.
{47:2} And he will bring me forth the way of the gate of the north; and he will turn me round the way without to the gate without the way looking to the east; and behold, waters flowing from the right shoulder.
{47:3} And in the going forth of the man eastward, and the line in his hand, and he will measure a thousand by the cubit, and he will cause me to pass through the waters; the waters of the soles.
{47:4} And he will measure a thousand, and he will cause me to pass through the waters; the waters of the knees. And he will measure a thousand, and cause me to pass through; the Waters of the loins.
{47:5} And he will measure a thousand, a torrent which I shall not be able to pass through: for the waters rose, waters of swimming, a torrent which shall not be passed through.
{47:6} And he will say to me, Didst thou see, son of man? And he will cause me to go, and he will turn me back upon the lip of the torrent.
{47:7} In my turning back, and behold, upon the lip of the torrent very much wood from here and from them.
{47:8} And he will say to me, These waters going forth to the circuit of the east, and they went down to Arabia and came into the sea: being brought forth to the sea and the waters were healed.
{47:9} And it was every living soul that shall creep, to all where the two torrents shall come there, shall live: and there was very many fish, because these waters came there: and they shall be healed and all lived where the torrent shall come there.
{47:10} And it was the fisherman shall stand upon it from the fountain of the kid, even to the fountain of the two calves; they shall be a spreading for nets; their fish shall be according to its kind as the fish of the great sea very many.
{47:11} Its marshes and its pools and they shall not be healed; they were given marshes to salt.
{47:12} And upon the torrent shall come up upon its lip, from hence and from thence, every tree of food, its leaf shall not fade, and its fruit shall not be consumed: for its months it shall bear early fruit, for its waters from the holy place they come forth: and its fruits were for food and its leaf for medicine.
{47:13} Thus said the Lord Jehovah: This the bound by which ye shall inherit the land for the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph two portions.
{47:14} And ye inherited it, each as his brother: which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers: and this land fell to you in inheritance.
{47:15} And this the bound of the land to the side of the north from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, to go to Zedad.
{47:16} Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the bound of Damascus and between the bound of Hamath; the middle enclosure which is to the bound of Hauran.
{47:17} And the bound from the sea was the enclosure of fountains, the hound of Damascus, and the north northward, and the bound of Hamath: And the side of the north.
{47:18} And the side of the east from between Hauran and from between Damascus, and from between Gilead and from between the land of Israel, Jordan, from the bound to the east sea shall ye measure: and the east side.
{47:19} And the south side southward from Tamar even to the waters of contradiction in Kadesh, the torrent to the the great sea: and the south side south
{47:20} And the side of the sea the great sea from the bound, even to over against the entrance of Hamath. This the side of the sea.
{47:21} And ye divided that land to you for the tribes of Israel.
{47:22} And ye shall cause it to fall in inheritance to you, and to the strangers sojourning in the midst of you, who begat sons in the midst of you: and they were to you as the nation among the sons of Israel with you they shall fall in the inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel.
{47:23} And it was in the tribe which the stranger sojourned with it there shall ye give his inheritance, says the Lord Jehovah.
{48:1} And these the names of the tribes: From the extremity north to the hand of the way of Hethlon to go to Hamath, the enclosure of the fountain, the bound of Damascus northward to the hand of Hamath, and they were to him the east side, the sea, Dan, one.
{48:2} And upon the bound of Dan from the side east even to the side of the sea, Asher, one.
{48:3} And upon the bound of Asher from the side east even to the side of the sea, Naphtali, one.
{48:4} And by the bound of Naphtali from the side east even to the side of the sea, Manasseh, one.
{48:5} And upon the bound of Manasseh from the side east even to the side of the sea, Ephraim, one.
{48:6} And upon the bound of Ephraim to the side east, even to the side of the Rea, Reuben, one.
{48:7} And upon the bound of Reuben from the side east even to the side of the sea, Judah, one.
{48:8} And upon the bound of Judah from the side east even to the side of the sea, shall be the oblation which ye shall lift up, five and twenty thousand the breadth, and the length as one of the portions from the side east, even to the side of the sea: and the holy place was in the midst of it.
{48:9} The oblation which ye shall lift up to Jehovah, the length, five and twenty thousand, and the breadth, ten thousand.
{48:10} And to these shall be the holy oblation to the priests; the north, five and: twenty thousand, and to the sea, the breadth ten thousand, and eastward, the breadth ten thousand, and to the south, the length five and twenty thousand, and the holy place of Jehovah was in: the midst of it.
{48:11} To the priests being consecrated: of the sons of Zadok, who watched my watches, who went not astray in the going astray of the sons of Israel, as the Levites went astray.
{48:12} And the oblation from the oblation of the land shall be to them holy of holies to the bound of the Levites.
{48:13} And the Levities over against the bound of the priests, five and twenty thousand the length, and the breadth ten thousand: all the length five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.
{48:14} And they shall not sell from it and it shall not be exchanged, and he shall not cause the first-fruits to pane away, for it is holy to Jehovah.
{48:15} And the five thousand being left in the breadth upon the face of the five and twenty thousand, this profane the city for dwelling and for an area, and the city was in the midst of it.
{48:16} And these its measures: the side north, five hundred and four thousand, and the south side five hundred and four thousand, and from the side east five hundred and four thousand, and the side of the sea, five hundred and four thousand.
{48:17} And the area was to the city northward, fifty and two hundred, and south, fifty and two hundred, and east, fifty and two hundred, and the sea, fifty and two hundred.
{48:18} And the remainder in the length over against the oblation of holiness, ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand to the sea: and it was over against the oblation of the holy place; and its Produce was for bread to the servants of the city.
{48:19} And serving the city they shall serve it from all the tribes of Israel.
{48:20} All the oblation five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: four square ye shall lift up the oblation of holiness for a possession of the city.
{48:21} And the remainder to the prince, from hence and from thence to the oblation of the holy place, and to the possession of the city at the face of five and twenty thousand of the oblation even to the bound eastward, and the sea, upon the face of five and twenty thousand upon the bound of the sea, over against the portions to the prince: and it was the oblation of holiness; and the holy place of the house in the midst of it.
{48:22} From the possession of the Levites from the possession of the city, in the midst of that to the prince, it shall be between the bound of Judah and between the bound of Benjamin, to the prince it shall be.
{48:23} And the rest of the tribes, from the side east even to the side of the sea, Benjamin, one.
{48:24} And upon the bound of Benjamin from the side east even to the side of the sea, Simeon, one.

{48:29} This the land which ye shall cause to fall for inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these their portions, says the Lord Jehovah.
{48:30} And these the goings out of the city from the side north, five hundred and four thousand the measure.
{48:31} And the gates of the city for the names of the tribes of Israel, three gates north; the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one.
