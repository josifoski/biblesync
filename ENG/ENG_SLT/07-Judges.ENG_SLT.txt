{1:1} And it will be after the death of Joshua, and the sons of Israel will ask of Jehovah, saying, Who will go up for us against the Canaanites in the beginning to war against them?
{1:2} And Jehovah will say, Judah shall go up: behold, I gave the land into his hand.
{1:3} And Judah will say to Simeon his brother, Go up with me into my lot, and we will fight against the Canaanite; and I also went up with thee into thy lot, and Simeon will go with him.
{1:4} And Judah will go up, and Jehovah will give the Canaanite and the Perizzite into their hand; and they will smite them in Bezek, ten thousand men,
{1:5} And they will find lord Bezek in Bezek: and they will war against him, and will smite the Canaanite and the Perizzite.
{1:6} And lord Bezek will flee, and they will pursue after him and take him; and they will cut off the thumbs of his hands and of his feet.
{1:7} And lord Bezek will say, Seventy kings with the thumbs of their hands and their feet being cut off, were gathering under my table; as I did so God requited me. And they will bring him to Jerusalem, and he will die there.
{1:8} And the sons of Judah will war against Jerusalem and will take it, and will smite it with the mouth of the sword, and they cast the city into fire.
{1:9} And afterward the sons of Judah went down to war against the Canaanite dwelling in the mountain, and in the south, and in the plain.
{1:10} And Judah will go against the Canaanite dwelling in Hebron: (and the name of Hebron before, the city of Arba:) and they will smite Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.
{1:11} And he will go from thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before, the city of the Book.
{1:12} And Caleb will say, Whoever shall smite the city of the Book and take it, and I will give to him Achsah my daughter for a wife.
{1:13} And Othniel, son of Kenaz, Caleb's brother, the small, will take it from him, and he will give to him Achsah his daughter for a wife.
{1:14} And it will be in her coming she will stimulate him to ask from her father a field: and she will descend from off the ass; and Caleb will say to her, What to thee?
{1:15} And she will say to him, Give to me a blessing: for thou gavest to me a south land, and give to me fountains of water. And Caleb will give to her the fountains above and the fountains below.
{1:16} And the sons of the Kenite, father-in-law of Moses, went up from the city of palm-trees with the sons of Judah to the desert of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and he went up and dwelt with the people:
{1:17} And Judah will go up with Simeon his brother, and they will smite the Canaanite dwelling in Zephath, and they will exterminate it, and he will call the name of the city, Hormah.
{1:18} And Judah will take Gaza and, its bounds, and Askelon and her bounds, and Ekron and her bounds.
{1:19} And Jehovah will be with Judah; and be will inherit the mountain because there was no driving out the inhabitants of the valley, for to them the chariot of iron.
{1:20} And they will give to Caleb, Hebron, as Moses space: and he will drive out from thence the three sons of Anak.
{1:21} And the Jebusite dwelling in Jerusalem, the sons of Benjamin did not drive out; and the Jebusite dwelt with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem even to this day.
{1:22} And the house of Joseph they also will go up to the house of God and Jehovah with them.
{1:23} And the house of Joseph will examine in the house of God. And the name of the city before, was Almond tree.
{1:24} And they watching will see a man coming out of the city, and they will say to him, Show to us the entrance of the city, and we will do mercy with thee.
{1:25} And he will show them the entrance of the city, and they will smite the city with the mouth of the sword: and that man and all his family they sent away.
{1:26} And the man will go up to the land of the Hittites, and he will build a city and call its name Luz; this its name till this day.
{1:27} And Manasseh did not drive out the House of Rest and her daughters, and Tanach and her daughters, and the inhabitants of Dor and her daughters, and the inhabitants of Ibleam and her daughters, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her daughters; and the Canaanite wills to dwell in that land.
{1:28} And it will be when Israel was strong, and he will put the Canaanite to tribute; and driving out, they did not drive out.
{1:29} And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanite dwelling in Gezer; and the Canaanite dwelt in his midst in Gezer.
{1:30} Zebulon did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, and the inhabitants of Nahalol; and the Canaanite will dwell in his midst, and they will be for tribute.
{1:31} Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Accho, and the inhabitants of Zidon and Ahlab and Achzib and Helbah, and Aphik, and Rehob:
{1:32} And the Asherite dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they drove not out.
{1:33} Naphtali drove not out the inhabitants of the House of the Sun, and the inhabitants of the House of Affliction; and he dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; and the inhabitants of the House of the Sun, and of the House of Response, they were to them for tribute.
{1:34} And the Amorites will press the sons of Dan to the mountain: for they gave not to come down to the valley:
{1:35} And the Amorite willed to dwell in mount Heres and in Ajalon, and in Shaalbim: and the hand of the house of Joseph will be heavy, and they will be for tribute.
{1:36} And the bound of the Amorite from the ascent of Akrabbim from the rock, and above.
{2:1} And a messenger of Jehovah will go up from Gilgal to Bochim, and he will say, I will bring you up out of Egypt, and I will bring you in to the land which I sware to your fathers; and he said I will not break my covenant with you forever.
{2:2} And ye shall not cut out a covenant to the inhabitants of this land; their altars ye shall break down: and ye heard not to my voice: why did ye this?
{2:3} And I also said, I will not drive them out from your face; and they were to you for adversaries, and their gods shall be to you for a snare.
{2:4} And it will be when the messenger of Jehovah spake these words to all the sons of Israel, and the people will lift up their voice and weep.
{2:5} And they will call the name of that place Bochim: and they will sacrifice there to Jehovah.
{2:6} And Joshua will send away the people, and the sons of Israel will go a man to his inheritance to inherit the land.
{2:7} And the people will serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the old men who prolonged the days after Joshua, who saw all the great works of Jehovah which he did to Israel.
{2:8} And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, will die, the son of a hundred and ten years.
{2:9} And they will bury him in the bound of his inheritance in Timnath-Serah, in mount Ephraim, from the north to the mount of Gaash.
{2:10} And also all that generation were gathered to its fathers; and another generation will arise after them not knowing Jehovah, and also the works which he did to Israel.
{2:11} And the sons of Israel will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and will serve the Baalims.
{2:12} And they will forsake Jehovah the God of their fathers bringing them out of the land of Egypt, and go after other gods from the gods of the peoples which are round about them, and they will worship to them and provoke Jehovah.
{2:13} And they will forsake Jehovah, and will serve Baal and Ashtaroth.
{2:14} And the wrath of Jehovah will kindle against Israel, and he will give them into the hand of plunderers, and they will plunder them; and he will sell them into the hand of their enemies from round about, and they will no more be able to stand before the face of their enemies.
{2:15} In all where they will go forth, the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah spake and as Jehovah sware to them: and he will press them greatly.
{2:16} And Jehovah will raise up judges, and they will save them from the hand of their plunderers.
{2:17} And also they will not hear to their judges, for they committed fornications after other gods, and they will worship to them: they turned aside quickly from the way which their fathers went to hear the commands of Jehovah; they did not so.
{2:18} And when Jehovah raised up to them judges, and Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them from the hand of their enemies all of the days of the judge: for Jehovah will grieve from their groaning from the face of those pressing them and thrusting them.
{2:19} And it was in the dying of the judge, they will turn back and be corrupted above their fathers to go after other gods to serve them and to worship to them: they let nothing fall from their deeds and from their hard way.
{2:20} And the wrath of Jehovah will kindle against Israel; and he will say, Because that this nation passed by my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and heard not to my voice,
{2:21} I also will not add to drive out a man from their face from the nations which Joshua left, and he died,
{2:22} So as to try Israel by them, whether they are watching the way of Jehovah to go in them, as their fathers watched, or not.
{2:23} And Jehovah will leave these nations, not to drive them out quickly, and he gave them not into the hand of Joshua.
{3:1} These the nations which Jehovah left to try Israel by them, (all which knew not the wars of Canaan;
{3:2} Only for the generations of the sons of Israel to know to teach them war, only who before knew not;)
{3:3} Five princes of Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivite dwelling in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-Hermon.
{3:4} And they will be to try Israel by them to know whether they will hear the commands of Jehovah which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
{3:5} And the sons of Israel dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites:
{3:6} And they will take their daughters to them for wives, and their daughters they will give to their sons, and they will serve their gods.
{3:7} And the sons of Israel will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and they will forget Jehovah their God, and they will serve the Baalims and the wooden pillars.
{3:8} And the wrath of Jehovah will kindle against Israel, and he will sell them into the hand of Cushan-Rishathaim, king of Aram-Naharim: and the sons of Israel will serve Cushan-Rishathaim eight years.
{3:9} And the sons of Israel will cry to Jehovah, and Jehovah will raise up a saviour to the sons of Israel, and he will save them, Othniel, son of Kenaz, Caleb's brother younger than he.
{3:10} And the spirit of Jehovah will be upon him, and he will judge Israel, and he will go forth to war: and Jehovah will give into his hand Cushan-Rishathaim, king of Aram; and his hand will be strong upon Cushan-Rishathaim.
{3:11} And the land will rest forty years: and Othniel, son of Kenaz, will die.
{3:12} And the sons of Israel will add to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah: and Jehovah will strengthen Eglon, king of Moab, against Israel, because they did evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
{3:13} And he will gather to him the sons of Ammon and Amalek, and he will go and smite Israel, and will inherit the city of palm-trees.
{3:14} And the sons of Israel will serve Eglon, king of Moab, eighteen years.
{3:15} And the sons of Israel will cry to Jehovah, and Jehovah will raise up to them a saviour, Ehud, son of Gera, son of a Benjamite, a man shut up of his right hand: and the sons of Israel will send a gift by his hand to Eglon, king of Moab.
{3:16} And Ehud will make to him a sword, and to it two mouths; a cubit its length: and he will gird it from under his garments upon his right thigh.
{3:17} And he will bring the gift to Eglon, king of Moab: and Eglon a very fat man.
{3:18} And it will be as he finished to bring the gift, and he will send away the people lifting up the gift.
{3:19} And he turned back from the carved images which were at Gilgal, and he will say, A hidden word to me for thee, O king: and he will say, Silence! And all standing by him will go forth from him.
{3:20} And Ehud came to him; and he sat in an upper chamber of cooling, which was to him alone: and Ehud will say, A word of God to me for thee. And he will rise from off the throne.
{3:21} And Ehud will stretch forth his left hand, and will take the sword from off his right thigh, and he will drive it into his belly:
{3:22} And the handle will also go in after the flame, and the fat will shut upon the flame, for he drew not the sword out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
{3:23} And Ehud will come forth to the portico, and he will shut the doors of the upper chamber upon him, and fasten.
{3:24} And he went forth, and his servants came in, and saw, and behold, the doors of the upper chamber were fastened; and they will say, Surely he is covering his feet in the chamber of cooling.
{3:25} And they will delay till being ashamed: and behold, he opened not the doors of the upper chamber; and they will take a key and will open: and behold, their lord fallen upon the earth, dead.
{3:26} And Ehud was saved during their consternation; and he passed by the carved images and will be saved at the gates.
{3:27} And it will be in his coming out, and he will clang upon the trumpet in mount Ephraim, and the sons of Israel will go down with him from the mountain, and he before them.
{3:28} And he will say to them, Follow after me, for Jehovah gave your enemies, Moab, into your hand. And they will go down after him and will take the passages of Jordan toward Moab, and they gave not a man to pass over.
{3:29} And they will smite Moab in that time, about ten thousand men, every one fat and every man strong: and not a man was saved.
{3:30} And Moab will be subdued in that day under the hand of Israel: and the land will rest eighty years.
{3:31} And after him was Shamgar, son of Anath; and he will smite the Philistines, six hundred men with an oxgoad; and he also will deliver Israel.
{4:1} And the sons of Israel will add to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and Ehud died.
{4:2} And Jehovah will sell them into the hand of Jabin, king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; and the captain of his army, Sisera; and he will dwell in Harosheth of the nations:
{4:3} And the sons of Israel will cry to Jehovah; for nine hundred chariots of iron to him; and he pressed the sons of Israel by force twenty years.
{4:4} And Deborah, a woman, a prophetess, wife to Lapidoth, she judged Israel in that time.
{4:5} And she will dwell under the palm tree of Deborah, between Ramah and between Bethel, in mount Ephraim: and the sons of Israel will go up to her for judgment.
{4:6} And she will send and call for Barak, son of Abinoam, from Kadesh Naphtali; and she will say to him, Did not Jehovah the God of Israel command, Go, and draw into mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men from the sons of Naphtali and from the sons of Zebulon?
{4:7} And I drew to thee to the torrent Kishon, Sisera, captain of Jabin's army, and his chariots and his multitude; and I gave him into thy hand.
{4:8} And Barak will say to her, If thou wilt go with me, and I will go: and if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go.
{4:9} And she will say, Going, I will go with thee: but yet it shall not be thine honor upon the way which thou goest; for Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah will rise and will go with Barak to Kadesh.
{4:10} And Barak will cry out to Zebulon and Naphtali to Kadesh; and he will go up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah will go up with him.
{4:11} And Heber the Kenite separated himself from Kain, from the sons of Hobab, father-in-law of Moses, and he will stretch out his tent even to the oak in Zaanaim which is at Kadesh.
{4:12} And they will announce to Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam, went up to mount Tabor.
{4:13} And Sisera will call together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people which are with him from Harosheth of the nations, to the torrent of Kishon.
{4:14} And Deborah will say to Barak, Arise; for this is the day which Jehovah gave Sisera into thine hand; went not Jehovah out before thee? and Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
{4:15} And Jehovah will discomfit Sisera and all the chariots and all the camp, with the mouth of the sword before Barak; and Sisera will descend from the chariot, and will flee on his feet.
{4:16} And Barak pursued after the chariots and after the camp, even to Harosheth of the nations: and all the camp of Sisera will fall by the mouth of the sword; there was not left even one.
{4:17} And Sisera fled upon his feet to the tent of Jael, wife of Heber, the Kenite: for peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
{4:18} And Jael will go forth to meet Sisera, and will say to him, Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; thou shalt not be afraid. And he will turn aside to her to the tent, and she will cover him with a carpet.
{4:19} And he will say to her, Give me to drink now a little water, for I thirsted. And she will open a sack of milk, and will give him drink, and will cover him.
{4:20} And he will say to her, stand at the door of the tent, and it was when a man shall come, and ask thee and say, Is a man here? and say thou, No.
{4:21} And Jael, Heber's wife, will take a peg of the tent, and will put a hammer in her hand, and will go to him softly, and will drive the peg into his temples, and it will go down into the earth; and he was in a deep sleep and was wearied. And he will die.
{4:22} And behold, Barak pursued Sisera, and Jael will come up to meet him, and she will say to him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest And he will go in to her, and behold, Sisera fallen dead, and the peg in his temples.
{4:23} And God will subdue in that day, Jabin, king of Canaan, before the sons of Israel.
{4:24} And the hand of the sons of Israel, going, will go, and be hard upon Jabin, king of Canaan, till they cut off Jabin, king of Canaan.
{5:1} And Deborah will sing, and Barak, son of Abinoam, in that day, saying,
{5:2} In the leading on of the leaders in Israel, In the willingness of the people, praise ye Jehovah.
{5:3} Hear, ye kings; give ear ye princes; I, to Jehovah, will I sing; I will play to Jehovah, God of Israel.
{5:4} Jehovah, in thy going forth from Seir, In thy ascending from the field of Edom, The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, Also the clouds dropped water.
{5:5} The mountains flowed from before Jehovah, This Sinai from before Jehovah, the God of Israel.
{5:6} In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, In the days of Jael, they left the ways; They went the by-ways; they will go the winding ways.
{5:7} The rulers ceased in Israel: they ceased Till I, Deborah, arose: I arose a mother in Israel.
{5:8} He will choose new gods; Then war in the gates: If a shield was seen, and a lance, Among forty thousand in Israel.
{5:9} My heart to the leaders of Israel, Those giving voluntarily among the people: Praise ye Jehovah.
{5:10} Ye riding upon white asses, Sitting upon jurisdiction, And going upon the way, speak ye.
{5:11} From the voice of arrows between the watering-troughs, There will they give the justices of Jehovah, The justices of his rule in Israel: Then will the people of Jehovah go down to the gates.
{5:12} Awake, awake! Deborah; Awake, awake! speak a song: Arise, Barak, and lead captive, thy captivity, son of Abinoam.
{5:13} Then the one left shall go down to the chiefs of the people: Jehovah will come down to me among the mighty.
{5:14} The fate of Ephraim uprooted them in Amalek; After thee, Benjamin, among thy tribes; From Machir the lawgivers came down, And from Zebulon they drawing with the rod of the scribe.
{5:15} And the chiefs in Issachar with Deborah; And Issachar, so Barak: In the valley sent he, upon his feet. In the divisions of Reuben, Great decrees of heart.
{5:16} Wherefore didst thou dwell in the midst of the folds, To hear the pipings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben, great searching's of heart.
{5:17} In Gilead beyond Jordan he dwelt; And Dan, wherefore will he sojourn in ships? Asher will dwell by the shore of the seas, And upon his harbors will he dwell.
{5:18} Zebulon a people reproached his soul to death, And Naphtali upon the heights of the field.
{5:19} Kings came: they fought: Then fought the kings of Canaan, Tanach, upon the water of Megiddo: Plunder of silver took they not.
{5:20} From the heavens they fought; The stars from their raised ways fought with Sisera.
{5:21} The torrent Kishon snatched them away The torrent of ancient days, the torrent of Kishon. Thou wilt tread down strength, O my soul.
{5:22} Then were the horse heels smitten From the courses, the courses of his strong ones.
{5:23} Curse ye Meroz, said the messenger of Jehovah: Cursing, curse ye her inhabitants; For they came not to the help of Jehovah To the help of Jehovah against the mighty ones.
{5:24} Blessed shall be Jael above women, The wife of Heber the Kenite, Above women in the tent shall she be blessed.
{5:25} He asked water, she gave milk; In a prince's dish brought she curdled milk.
{5:26} Her hand to the peg will she stretch forth, And her right hand to the hammer of labor, And she struck Sisera; she smote through his head, And she crushed and pierced through his temples.
{5:27} Between her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: Between her feet he bowed, he fell: Where he bowed, there he fell, destroyed.
{5:28} Through the window she looked forth and cried out, The mother of Sisera, through the lattice Why did his chariot delay to come? Why lingered the paces of his chariots?
{5:29} Her wise chiefs will answer, Surely, will she turn back words to herself,
{5:30} Will they not find? They will divide the spoil; He compassionated compassions to head of man; The spoil of dyed garments to Sisera, A spoil of dyed garments of variegation, Dyed of double variegation for the necks of the spoil.
{5:31} So shall all thine enemies perish, O Jehovah: And those loving him, as the going forth of the sun in his strength. And the land will rest forty years.
{6:1} And the sons of Israel will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and Jehovah will give them into the hand of Midian seven years.
{6:2} And the hand of Midian will be strong upon Israel: from the face of Midian the sons of Israel made to them clefts which are in the mountains, and caves and fastnesses.
{6:3} And it was if Israel sowed, and Midian came up, and Amalek, and the sons of the east, and they came up against him:
{6:4} And they will encamp against them, and they will destroy the produce of the land even to thy coming to Gaza; and they will not leave means of life in Israel, and sheep and ox and ass.
{6:5} For they and their cattle will come up, and their tents will come, as an abundance of locusts for multitude; and to them and to their camels no number: and they will come into the land to destroy it.
{6:6} And Israel will be enfeebled from the face of Midian; and the sons of Israel will cry to Jehovah.
{6:7} And it will be when the sons of Israel cried to Jehovah on account of Midian,
{6:8} And Jehovah will send forth a man, a prophet, to the sons of Israel, and he will say to them, Thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and I will bring you out of the house of servants;
{6:9} And I will deliver you from the hand of Egypt, and from the hand of all pressing you, and I will drive them out from your face, and I will give to you their land;
{6:10} And saying to you, I am Jehovah your God; ye shall not fear the Gods of the Amorites which ye will dwell in their land: and ye heard not to my voice.
{6:11} And a messenger of Jehovah will come and sit under an oak which is in Ophrah, which is to Joash, father of Ezri: and Gideon his son threshed wheat in the wine press to place in safety from the face of Midian.
{6:12} And the messenger of Jehovah will be seen to him, and he will say to him, Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty of strength.
{6:13} And Gideon will say to him With leave, my Lord, and Jehovah be; with us, and wherefore did all this find us? and where all his wonderful things which our fathers recounted to us, saying, Did not Jehovah bring us up out of Egypt? and now Jehovah cast us off, and he will give us into the hand of Midian.
{6:14} And Jehovah will turn to him and say, Go in this thy strength and save Israel from the hand of Midian: did I not send thee?
{6:15} And he will say to him, With leave, my Lord, by what shall I save Israel? behold, my thousand destitute in Manasseh, and I the least in my father's house.
{6:16} And Jehovah will say to him, For I will be with thee, and strike thou Midian as one man.
{6:17} And he will say to him, If now I found grace in thine eyes, and do to me a sign that thou speakest with me.
{6:18} Now thou shalt not depart from here till my coming to thee, and I brought forth my gift and set it before thee. And he will say, I will remain till thy turning back.
{6:19} And Gideon went in, and he will do a kid of the goats, and an ephah of flour of unleavened: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and he will bring forth to him under the oak and will bring near.
{6:20} And the messenger of God will say to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened and lay upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he will do so.
{6:21} And the messenger of Jehovah will stretch forth the extremity of the staff which in his hand, and will touch upon the flesh and on the unleavened; and fire will rise up from the rock and will consume the flesh and the unleavened. And the messenger of Jehovah went from his eyes.
{6:22} And Gideon will see that he a messenger of Jehovah; and Gideon will say, Ah, Lord Jehovah! for on account that I saw a messenger of Jehovah face to face.
{6:23} And Jehovah will say to him, Peace to thee; thou shalt not fear; thou shalt not die.
{6:24} And Gideon will build there an altar to Jehovah, and he will call to him Jehovah-peace: till this day and it yet in Ophrah of the father of Edrei.
{6:25} And it will be in that night Jehovah will say to him, Take a bullock of the oxen which is to thy father, and the second bullock of seven years, and break in pieces the altar of Baal, which is to thy father, and the wooden pillar which is upon it thou shalt cut down;
{6:26} And build an altar to Jehovah thy God upon the head of this strong place, in order, and take the second bullock and bring up a burnt-offering upon the wood of the wooden pillar which thou shalt cut down.
{6:27} And Gideon will take ten men of his servants, and he will do as Jehovah spake to him: and it will be as he will fear the house of his father and the men of the city doing in the day, and he will do in the night.
{6:28} And the men of the city will rise early in the morning, and behold, the altar of Baal thrown down, and the wooden pillar which is upon it cut down, and the second bullock brought up upon the altar having been built.
{6:29} And they will say a man to his neighbor, Who did this word? And they will enquire and search, and they will say, Gideon, son of Joash did this word.
{6:30} And the men of the city will say to Joash, Bring forth thy son and he shall die: for he threw down the altar of Baal, and because he cut down the wooden pillar which is upon it.
{6:31} And Joash will say to all who stood against him, Will ye contend for Baal? or will ye save him? whoever will contend for him shall die during the morning: if he is a god he will be mighty for himself, for he threw down his altar.
{6:32} And he will call to him in that day, Baal will be powerful, saying, Baal will be mighty against him because he threw down his altar.
{6:33} And all Midian and Amalek, and the sons of the east were gathered together, and they will pass over and they will encamp in the valley of Jezreel.
{6:34} And the spirit of Jehovah clothed Gideon, and he will strike upon the trumpet; and Abiezer will be called after him.
{6:35} And he sent messengers in all Manasseh; and he also will be called after him: and he sent messengers in Asher, and in Zebulon, and in Naphtali; and they will come up to meet them.
{6:36} And Gideon will say to God, If thou art saving Israel by my hand, as thou spakest,
{6:37} Behold me putting a fleece of wool in the threshing-floor, and if the dew shall be upon the fleece only, and upon all the earth dryness, and I knew that thou wilt save Israel by my hand as thou spakest.
{6:38} And it will be so: and he will rise early upon the morrow, and he will press the fleece together, and the dew will press out from the fleece, a bowl full of water.
{6:39} And Gideon will say to God, Thine anger will not kindle against me, and I will speak but this once: I will try now only this once upon the fleece; there shall be dryness to the fleece alone, and upon all the earth shall be dew.
{6:40} And God will do so in that night: and there will be dryness to the fleece only, and upon all the earth was dew.
{7:1} And Jerub-Baal (he is Gideon) will rise early and all the people that is with him, and they will encamp by the fountain of Harod: and the camp of Midian was to him from the north from the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
{7:2} And Jehovah will say to Gideon, The people many which are with thee for me to give Midian into their hand, lest Israel shall glory before me, saying, My hand saved me.
{7:3} And now, call now in the ears of the people, saying, Who being afraid and trembling shall turn back and turn about from mount Gilead. And there will turn back from the people twenty and two thousand; and ten thousand were left.
{7:4} And Jehovah will say to Gideon, Yet the people many; bring them down to the waters, and I will purify them for thee there; and it shall be of whom saying to thee, This shall go with thee, he shall go with thee; and all which saying to thee, This shall not go with thee, he shall not go.
{7:5} And he will bring down the people to the waters: and Jehovah will say to Gideon, Every one which shall lap with his tongue from the waters as the dog will lap, thou shalt put him alone; and all which shall bend upon his knees to drink.
{7:6} And the number of those lapping with their hand to their mouth, will be three hundred men: and all the remainder of the people bowed upon their knees to drink water.
{7:7} And Jehovah will say to Gideon, By the three hundred men lapping, I will save you, and give Midian into thy hand: and all the people shall go, a man to his place.
{7:8} And the people will take food in their hand and their trumpets: and he sent all the men of Israel a man to his tent, and by the three hundred men he was strengthened: and the camp of Midian was to him beneath in the valley.
{7:9} And it will be in that night, and Jehovah will say to him, Arise, go down to the camp, for I gave him into thy hand.
{7:10} And if thou shalt fear to go down go down thou and Phurah thy youth to the camp:
{7:11} And thou heardest what they shall speak: and afterward thy hands shall be strengthened, and go down to the camp. And he will go down, he and Phurah his boy to the extremity of the brave which in the camp.
{7:12} And Midain and Amalek, and all the sons of the east, encamping in the valley, as the locust for multitude; and to their camels no number, as the sand which is upon the lip of the sea for multitude.
{7:13} And Gideon will come, and behold, a man recounting a dream to his neighbor; and he will say, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and behold, a round cake of barley bread rolling into the camp of Midian; and it will come even to the tent, and it will strike it, and it will fall and will turn it over, so that the tent fell.
{7:14} And his neighbor will answer and say, This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon, son of Joash, a man of Israel: God gave into his hand Midian, and all the camp.
{7:15} And it will be when Gideon heard the recounting of the dream and its breaking, and he will worship, and turn back to the camp of Israel, and he will say, Arise, ye, for Jehovah gave into your hand the camp of Midian.
{7:16} And he will divide the three hundred men into three beginnings, and he will give trumpets into the hand of them all, and empty buckets, and torches in the midst of the buckets.
{7:17} And he will say to them, Ye shall look upon me, and so shall ye do: and behold me coming to the extremity of the camp, and it was as I shall do, so ye shall do.
{7:18} And I struck upon the trumpet, I and all that are with me, and ye struck upon the trumpets, also ye round about all the camp, and say, For Jehovah and for Gideon.
{7:19} And Gideon will go and the hundred men that are with him, to the extremity of the, camp, the beginning of the middle watch; only now rising up they raised up those watching: and they will strike upon the trumpets, and they brake the buckets that are in their hand.
{7:20} And the three heads will strike upon the trumpets, and will break the buckets, and they will hold fast in their left hand upon the torches, and in their right hand the trumpets to strike: and they will call the sword for Jehovah and for Gideon.
{7:21} And they will stand a man for himself round about the camp; and all the camp will run and cry out and flee.
{7:22} And the three hundred will clang the trumpets, and Jehovah will set the sword of a man against his neighbor and in all the camp: and the camp fled even to the House of Acacia of Zererath, even to the lip of Abel-Meholah, to Tabbath.
{7:23} And a man of Israel will be called from Naphtali, and from Asher, and from Manasseh, and they will pursue after Midian.
{7:24} And Gideon sent messengers into all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down to meet Midian, and take before them the waters even to the House of Passage, and Jordan. And every man of Ephraim will be called together, and they will take the waters even to the House of Passage and Jordan.
{7:25} And they will take the two chiefs of Midian. Oreb and Zeeb; and they will kill Oreb upon the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the wine press of Zeeb, and they pursued against Midian, and the heads of Oreb and Zeeb they brought to Gideon beyond Jordan.
{8:1} And the men of Ephraim will say to him, Why didst thou this word to us, that thou calledst not to us when thou wentest to war against Midian? and they will contend with him with strength.
{8:2} And he will say to them, What now did I according to you? are not the gleanings of Ephraim good above the vintage of Abi-Ezer?
{8:3} Into your hand God gave the chiefs of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do according to you? Then was their spirit relaxed from over him in his speaking this word.
{8:4} And Gideon will come to Jordan to pass through, he and the three hundred men that are with him, faint and pursuing.
{8:5} And he will say to the men of Succoth, Ye shall give now rounds of bread to the people who are at my feet: for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.
{8:6} And the chiefs of Succoth will say, Is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand that bread was given to thine army?
{8:7} And Gideon will say, For this in Jehovah's giving Zebah and Zalmunna into my band, and I threshed your flesh with thorns of the desert and threshing-sledges.
{8:8} And he will go up from thence to Penuel, and he will say to them like this: and the men of Penuel will answer him as the men of Succoth answered.
{8:9} And he will say also to the men of Penuel, saying, In my turning back in peace I will break down this tower.
{8:10} And Zebah and Zalmunna are in Karkor, and their camps with them, about fifteen thousand, all those remaining from all the camp of the sons of the east: and there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men drawing the sword.
{8:11} And Gideon will go up the way of those dwelling in tents from the east to Nobah and Jogbehah, and he will smite the camp; and the camp was secure.
{8:12} And Zebah and Zalmunna will flee, and he will pursue after them and he will take the two kings of Midian Zebah and Zalmunna, and he terrified all the camp.
{8:13} And Gideon son of Joash, will turn back from the war from the cliff of the sun.
{8:14} And he will take a youth from the men of Succoth, and he will ask him: and he will write for him the chiefs of Succoth and its old men, seventy and seven men.
{8:15} And he will come to the men of Succoth, and he will say, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna with whom ye reproached me, saying, Is the hand of Zebah and. Zalmunna now in thine hand to give bread to thy men being weary?
{8:16} And he will take the old men of the city, and thorns of the desert, and threshing sledges, and with them he caused the men of Succoth to know.
{8:17} And he brake down the tower of Penuel, and he will kill the men of the city.
{8:18} And he will say to Zebah and Zalmunna, Whose the men which ye killed in Tabor? and they will say, As thou, so they; one according to the form of the sons of the king.
{8:19} And he will say, My brethren, the sons of my mother: Jehovah lives, would that ye preserved them alive, and I had not slain you.
{8:20} And he will say to Jether his first-born, Arise, kill them. But the youth drew not his sword, for he was afraid, because he was yet a youth.
{8:21} And Zebah will say, and Zalmunna, Arise, and fall upon us: for as a man, his strength. And Gideon will rise and kill Zebah and Zalmunna, and he will take the little moons upon their camels' necks.
{8:22} And the men of Israel will say to Gideon, Rule over us, also thou, also thy son, also thy son's son: for thou savedst us from the hand of Midian.
{8:23} And Gideon will say to them, I will not rule over you, and my son shall not rule over you: Jehovah shall rule over you.
{8:24} And Gideon will say to them, I will ask of you an asking, and ye shall give to me a man the rings of his spoil: for gold rings to them, because they were Ishmaelites.
{8:25} And they will say, Giving, we will give. And they will spread a garment, and they will cast there each the rings of his spoil.
{8:26} And the weight of the gold rings which he asked will be a thousand and seven hundred of gold; besides of little moons and earrings and purple robes which were upon the kings of Midian, and besides from the collars which upon their camels' necks.
{8:27} And Gideon will make it into an ephod, and he will put in his city, Ophrah: and all Israel will commit fornication after it there: and it will be to Gideon and to his house for a snare.
{8:28} And Midian will be subdued before the sons of Israel, and they will not add to lift up their head: and the land will rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
{8:29} And Jerubbaal, son of Joash, will go and dwell in his house.
{8:30} And to Gideon were seventy sons going out of his thigh: for many women were to him.
{8:31} And his concubine which is in Shechem, she will bear to him a son, and she will set his name Abimelech.
{8:32} And Gideon will die in a good old age, and he will be buried in the grave of Joash his father, in Ophrah, of the father of Ezri.
{8:33} And it will be when Gideon died the sons of Israel will turn back, and will commit fornication after the Baalims, and they will set to them Baal of the covenant for their god.
{8:34} And the sons of Israel did not remember Jehovah their God, delivering them out of the hand of all their enemies from round about.
{8:35} And they did not kindness with the house of Jerubbaal, Gideon, according to all the good which he did with Israel.
{9:1} And Abimelech son of Jerubbaal, will come to Shechem to his mother's brethren, and say to them, to all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
{9:2} Speak, now, in the ears of all the lords of Shechem, What good to you for seventy men of all the sons of Jerubbaal to rule over you, or one man to rule over you? and remember that I am your bone and your flesh.
{9:3} And his mother's brethren will speak concerning him in the ears of all the lords of Shechem all these words: and their heart will incline after Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.
{9:4} And they will give him seventy of silver from the house of Baal of the covenant, and Abimelech will hire with them men empty and vain-glorious, and they will go after him.
{9:5} And he will come to his father's house at Ophrah, and will kill his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men upon one stone: and Jotham the young son of Jerubbaal will be left, for he was hid.
{9:6} And all the lords of Shechem will gather together, and all the House of the Rampart, and they will make Abimelech king, by the Oak of the Pillar which is in Shechem.
{9:7} And they will announce to Jotham and he will go and stand upon the head of mount Gerizim, and he will lift up his voice and call, and say to them, Hear to me, ye lords of Shechem, and God will hear to you.
{9:8} The trees going forth went to anoint over them a king; and they will say to the olive, Reign thou over us.
{9:9} And the olive will say to them, Left I my fatness which by me they will honor God and men, and went I to wander about over the trees?
{9:10} And the trees will say to the fig tree, Come thou, reign over us.
{9:11} And the fig tree will say to them, Left I my sweetness, and my good produce, and went I to wander about over the trees?
{9:12} And the trees will say to the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.
{9:13} And the vine will say to them, Left I my new wine-making, rejoicing God and men, and went I to wander about over the trees?
{9:14} And all the trees will say to the buckthorn. Come thou, reign over us.
{9:15} And the buckthorn will say to the trees, If in truth ye anoint me for king over you, come, take refuge in my shadow: and if not, fire shall come forth from the buckthorn and shall consume the cedars of Lebanon.
{9:16} And now if in truth and in uprightness ye did and ye shall make Abimelech king, and if ye did good with Jerubbaal and with his house, and if according to the desert of his hands ye did to him:
{9:17} (For my father fought for you, and he will cast his soul away, and he will deliver you from the hand of Midian.
{9:18} And ye rose up against the house of my father this day, and ye will kill his sons, seventy men, upon one stone; and ye will make Abimelech, son of his maid, king over the lords of Shechem, because he is your brother:)
{9:19} And if in sincerity and uprightness ye did with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, rejoice ye in Abimelech, and he shall rejoice also in you.
{9:20} And if not, fire shall come forth from Abimelech and shall consume the lords of Shechem and the House of the Rampart; and fire shall come forth from the lords of Shechem and from the House of the Rampart, and shall consume Abimelech.
{9:21} And Jotham will flee, and break away, and he will go to the well and will dwell there from the face of Abimelech his brother.
{9:22} And Abimelech will have dominion over Israel three years,
{9:23} And God will send an evil spirit between Abimelech and between the lords of Shechem; and the lords of Shechem will act deceitfully with Abimelech,
{9:24} To bring the wrong of the seventy sons of Jerubbaal and to put their blood upon Abimelech their brother who killed them, and upon the lords of Shechem who strengthened his hands to kill his brethren.
{9:25} And the lords of Shechem will set for him liers in wait upon the heads of the mountains, and they will rob all who shall pass over by them in the way: and it was announced to Abimelech.
{9:26} And Gaal son of Ebed will come, and his brethren, and they will pass over to Shechem: and the lords of Shechem will trust in him.
{9:27} And they will go forth to the field, and they will gather their vineyards, and they will tread down, and they will make rejoicings, and go in to the house of their God, and they will eat and drink, and curse Abimelech.
{9:28} And Gaal son of Ebed will say, Who Abimelech, and who Shechem, that we shall serve him? is he not the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his overseer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: and why shall we serve him?
{9:29} And who will give this people into my hand? And I will remove Abimelech. And he will say to Abimelech, Increase thine army and come forth.
{9:30} And Zebul the ruler of the city will hear the words of Gaal, son of Ebed, and his wrath will kindle.
{9:31} And he will send messengers to Abimelech in deceit, saying, Behold, Gaal son of Ebed, and his brethren, came to Shechem; and behold, they pressed the city against thee.
{9:32} And now, rise up by night, thou and the people which are with thee, and lie in wait in the field:
{9:33} And it was in the morning when the sun rose, thou shalt rise early and invade upon the city: and behold, he and the people which with him coming forth against thee; and do thou to him as thy hand shall find.
{9:34} And Abimelech will rise, and all the people which are with him, by night, and they will lie in wait against Shechem in four heads.
{9:35} And Gaal son of Ebed will go forth, and he will stand at the door of the gate of the city: and Abimelech will rise, and the people that are with him, from the ambush.
{9:36} And Gaal will see the people, and he will say to Zebul, Behold, people coming down from the heads of the mountains. And Zebul will say to him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as men.
{9:37} And Gaal will add to speak, and will say, Behold, people coming down from the height of the land, and one head coming from the way of the oak of Meonenim.
{9:38} And Zebul will say to him, Where now thy mouth with which thou wilt say, Who Abimelech, that we shall serve him? is not this the people which thou despised it? now go forth now, and fight with it.
{9:39} And Gaal will go forth before the lords of Shechem, and he will fight against Abimelech.
{9:40} And Abimelech will pursue him and he will flee from his face, and many will fall wounded at the door of the gate.
{9:41} And Abimelech will dwell in Arumah: and Zebul will drive out Gaal and his brethren from dwelling in Shechem.
{9:42} And it will be from the morrow, and the people will go forth to the field; and they will announce to Abimelech.
{9:43} And he will take the people and will divide them into three heads, and he will lie in wait in the field, and he will see, and behold, the people will come forth from the city, and he will rise up against them and smite them.
{9:44} And Abimelech and the heads which are with him will invade, and they will stand at the door of the gate of the city: and two heads will invade upon all which are in the field, and they will smite them.
{9:45} And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he will take the city, and the people which in it he killed, and he will tear down the city, and will sow it with salt.
{9:46} And all the lords of the tower of Shechem will hear, and they will go in to the tower of the god of the covenant.
{9:47} And it was announced to Abimelech that all the lords of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
{9:48} And Abimelech will go up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that with him; and Abimelech will take axes in his hand, and he will cut boughs of the trees, and will lift up and will put upon his shoulder, and he will say to the people which are with him, What ye saw I did, hasten, do like me.
{9:49} And also all the people will cut each a bough, and will go after Abimelech, and they will put upon the tower, and will set the tower on fire upon them, and all the men of the tower of Shechem will die; about a thousand men and women.
{9:50} And Abimelech will go to Thebez, and he will encamp against Thebez and take it.
{9:51} And a strong tower was in the midst of the city, and thither will flee all the men and women and all the lords of the city, and will shut up from after them, and they will go up upon the roof of the tower.
{9:52} And Abimelech will come even to the tower, and will fight against it, and will urge on, even to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
{9:53} And one woman will cast a piece of the upper mill-stone upon the head of Abimelech, and she will break his skull.
{9:54} And he will call quickly to the youth lifting up his weapons, and he will say to him, Draw thy sword and put me to death, lest they shall say of me, A woman killed him. And his youth will thrust him through and he will die.
{9:55} And the men of Israel will see that Abimelech died, and they will go each to his place.
{9:56} And God will turn back the evil of Abimelech which he did to his father for killing his seventy brethren.
{9:57} And all the evil of the men of Shechem God turned back upon their head: and against them will come the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
{10:1} And after Abimelech will rise to save Israel, Tola, the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir, in mount Ephraim.
{10:2} And he will judge Israel twenty and three years; and he will die and be buried in Shamir.
{10:3} And after him will rise Jair the Gileadite, and he will judge Israel twenty and two years.
{10:4} And to him will be thirty sons riding upon thirty young asses, and thirty cities to them; and they will call them the villages of Jair even to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
{10:5} And Jair will die and be buried in Canon.
{10:6} And the sons of Israel will add to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and they will serve the Baalims, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the sons of Ammon, and the gods of Philisteim; and they will forsake Jehovah and not serve.
{10:7} And the wrath of Jehovah will kindle against Israel, and he will sell them into the hand of Philisteim, and into the hand of the sons of Ammon.
{10:8} And they will oppress and break down the sons of Israel in that year, eighteen years, all the sons of Israel that are beyond Jordan in the land of the Amorite which is in Gilead.
{10:9} And the sons of Ammon will pan over Jordan to war also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim: and it will press upon Israel greatly.
{10:10} And the sons of Israel will cry to Jehovah, saying, We sinned against thee because we forsook our God, and we shall serve the Baalims.
{10:11} And Jehovah will say to the sons of Israel, Was it not out of Egypt, and from the Amorite, and from the sons of Ammon and from Philisteim?
{10:12} And the Zidonians and Amalek, and Maon pressed you; and ye will cry to me, and I will save you from their hand.
{10:13} And ye forsook me, and ye will serve other gods: wherefore I will not add to save you.
{10:14} Go and cry to the gods, which ye chose among them; they shall save for you in time of your straits.
{10:15} And the sons of Israel will say to Jehovah, We sinned: do thou to us according to all the good in thine eyes; but deliver us now, this day.
{10:16} And they will remove the strange gods from the midst of them, and they will serve Jehovah: and his soul will be shortened for the labor of Israel.
{10:17} And the sons of Ammon will be called together, and they will encamp in Gilead. And the sons of Israel will assemble together and encamp in Mizpeh.
{10:18} And the people, the chiefs of Gilead, will say, a man to his neighbor, Who the man that will begin to war against the sons of Ammon? he shall be for head to all those dwelling in Gilead.
{11:1} And Jephthah the Gileadite was a man of strength, and he the son of a woman, a harlot And Gilead will beget Jephthah.
{11:2} And Gilead's wife will bring forth sons to him, and his wife's sons will grow, and they will drive out Jephthah, and they will say to him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house, for thou the son of another woman.
{11:3} And Jephthah will flee from the face of his brethren and will dwell in the land of Tob: and empty men will gather together to Jephthah and will go forth with him.
{11:4} And it will be from days and the sons of Ammon will war with Israel.
{11:5} And it will be when the sons of Ammon warred with Israel, and the old men of Israel will go to take Jephthah out of the land of Tob.
{11:6} And they will say to Jephthah, Come and be to us for leader, and we will war against the sons of Ammon.
{11:7} And Jephthah will say to the old men of Gilead, Did ye not hate me, and ye will drive me out from my father's house? and why came ye to me now when there is distress to you?
{11:8} And the old men of Gilead will say to Jephthah, Therefore now we turned back to thee, and come thou with us and we will war against the sons of Ammon, and be to us for head to all dwelling in Gilead.
{11:9} And Jephthah will say to the old men of Gilead, If ye turn me back to war against the sons of Ammon, and Jehovah gave them before me, shall I be to you for head?
{11:10} And the old men of Gilead will say to Jephthah, Jehovah shall be hearing between us, if we did not thus to thee according to thy word.
{11:11} And Jephthah will go with the old men of Gilead, and the people will set him over them for head and for chief: and Jephthah will speak all his words before Jehovah in Mizpeh.
{11:12} And Jephthah will send messengers to the king of the sons of Ammon, saying, What to me and to thee that thou camest to me to war in my land.
{11:13} And the king of the sons of Ammon will say to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took my land in his coming up out of Egypt, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and even to Jordan: and now turn them back in peace.
{11:14} And Jephthah will add yet and will send messengers to the king of the sons of Ammon:
{11:15} And he will say to him, Thus said Jephthah, Israel took not the land of Moab and the land of the sons of Ammon:
{11:16} When in their coming up out of Egypt, and Israel went in the desert, even to the sea of sedge, and he will come to Kadesh;
{11:17} And Israel will send messengers to the king of Edom, saying, I will pass through now in thy land: and the king of Edom heard not And also to the king of Moab he sent; and he was not willing. And Israel dwelt in Kadesh.
{11:18} And he will go into the wilderness, and he will encompass the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and he will come from the rising of the sun to the land of Moab, and they will encamp beyond Arnon; and they went not in to the bound of Moab, for Arnon is the bound of Moah
{11:19} And Israel will send messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon; and Israel will say to him, We will pass now through in thy land, even to my place.
{11:20} And Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through in his bound; and Sihon will gather together all his people and will encamp in Jahaz, and he will war with Israel.
{11:21} And Jehovah the God of Israel will give Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they will smite them: and Israel will inherit all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that land.
{11:22} And they will inherit all the bound of the Amorites from Arnon and even to Jabbok, and from the desert and even to Jordan.
{11:23} And now Jehovah the God of Israel drove out the Amorites from the face of his people Israel, and shalt thou inherit it?
{11:24} Shalt thou not inherit what Chemosh thy god will give thee to inherit? and all which Jehovah our God drove out from our face, we will inherit it.
{11:25} And now being good, art thou good above Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab? striving, did he contend with Israel, or warring, did he war against them.
{11:26} In Israel's dwelling in Heshbon and her daughters and in Aroer and her daughters, and in all the cities which are upon the hands of Arnon, three hundred years? and why took ye not them away in that time?
{11:27} And I sinned not against thee, and thou didst me evil to war against me: Jehovah the Judge will judge this day between the sons of Israel and between the sons of Ammon.
{11:28} And the king of the sons of Ammon heard not to the words of Jephthah which he sent to him.
{11:29} And the spirit of Jehovah will be upon Jephthah, and he will pass through Gilead and Manasseh, and he will pass through Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the sons of Ammon.
{11:30} And Jephthah will vow a vow to Jehovah, and he will say, If giving, thou wilt give the sons of Ammon into my hand,
{11:31} And it was, that coming forth which shall come forth from the doors of my house to my meeting in my turning back in peace from the sons of Ammon, and it was to Jehovah; and I brought it up a burnt-offering.
{11:32} And Jephthah will pass over to the sons of Ammon to war against them: and Jehovah will give them into his hand.
{11:33} And he will strike them from Aroer even to thy going to Minnith, twenty cities, and even to the meadow of the vineyards, with a very great smiting. And the sons of Ammon will be subdued from the face of the sons of Israel.
{11:34} And Jephthah will come to Mizpeh to his house, and behold, his daughter will come forth to his meeting with drums and with lutes: and she the only begotten; not to him beside her, son nor daughter.
{11:35} And it will be when he saw her, and he will tear his garments, and will say, Alas, my daughter bowing down, thou didst bow me down, and thou art in my trouble: and I opened my mouth to Jehovah, and I shall not be able to turn back.
{11:36} And she will say to him, My father, opening thy mouth to Jehovah, do to me according to what came forth from thy mouth, after that Jehovah did for thee vengeance of thine enemies, of the sons of Ammon.
{11:37} And she will say to her father, This word shall be done to me: desist from me two months, and I will go, and go down upon the mountains, and I will lament over my virginity, I and my friends.
{11:38} And he will say, Go. And he will send her away two months: and she will go and her friends, and she will lament over her virginity upon the mountains.
{11:39} And it will be from the end of two months, and she will turn back to her father and he will do to her his vow which he vowed: and she knew not man. And it will be a law in Israel,
{11:40} From days of days the daughters of Israel will go to celebrate to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite, four days in the year.
{12:1} And a man of Ephraim will cry out and will pass over north, and they will say to Jephthah, Why didst thou pass over to war against the sons of Ammon and didst not call to us to go with thee? we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.
{12:2} And Jephthah will say to them, I was a man of strife, I and my people and the sons of Ammon greatly; and I shall cry out to you, and ye saved me not from their hands.
{12:3} And I shall see that thou savest not, and I shall put my soul in my hand, and I shall pass over to the sons of Ammon, and Jehovah will give them into my hand: and wherefore came ye up to me this day to war against me?
{12:4} And Jephthah will gather together all the men of Gilead, and he will war with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead will strike Ephraim because they said, The escaped of Ephraim, ye of Gilead, in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh.
{12:5} And Gilead will take the passages of Jordan before Ephraim: and it was that the escaped of Ephraim will say, I will pass over; and the men of Gilead will say to him, Thou an Ephrathite? and he will say, No.
{12:6} And they will say to him, Say now Shibboleth: and he will say, Sibboleth and he will not form to speak thus. And they will seize him and they will slaughter him at the passages of Jordan. And there will fall in that time of Ephraim forty and two thousand.
{12:7} And Jephthah will judge Israel six years: and Jephthah the Gileadite will die, and will be buried in the city of Gilead.
{12:8} And after him Ibzan of the House of Bread, will judge Israel.
{12:9} And there will be to him thirty sons and thirty daughters he sent without, and thirty daughters he brought in to his sons from without: and he will judge Israel seven years.
{12:10} And Ibzan will die, and will be buried in the House of Bread.
{12:11} And after him Elon the Zebulonite, will judge Israel; and he will judge Israel ten years.
{12:12} And Elon the Zebulonite will die and will be buried in Elon in the land of Zebulon.
{12:13} And after him Abdon, son of Hillel the Pirathonite, will judge Israel.
{12:14} And there will be to him forty sons and thirty sons' sons riding upon seventy young asses: and he will judge Israel eight years.
{12:15} And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite, will die, and will be buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekite.
{13:1} And the sons of Israel will add to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah; and Jehovah will give them into the hand of Philisteim forty years.
{13:2} And there will be one man from Zorah from the families of the Danites, and his name Manoah; and his wife sterile, and she bare not.
{13:3} And a messenger of Jehovah will be seen to the woman, and will say to her, Behold, now, thou art barren, and bearest not; and thou conceivedst and bearest a son.
{13:4} And now, watch now, and drink not wine and strong drink, and thou shalt not eat any thing unclean:
{13:5} For behold thee pregnant, and thou bearest a son; and a razor shall not come up upon his head, for the boy shall be consecrated to God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel from the hand of Philisteim.
{13:6} And the woman will go and will say to her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his sight as the sight of the messenger of God, very terrible: and I asked him not from whence he is, and his name he announced not to me.
{13:7} And he will say to me, Behold, thee conceiving, and thou bearest a son; and now drink not wine and strong drink, and thou shalt not eat any thing unclean, for the boy shall be consecrated to God from the womb, even to the day of his death.
{13:8} And Manoah will pray to Jehovah and will say, With leave, my Lord, a man of God which thou sentest will he come now yet to us, and he will teach us what we shall do to the boy being brought forth.
{13:9} And God will hear to the voice of Manoah, and the messenger of God will come yet to the woman, and she will sit in the field; and Manoah her man not with her.
{13:10} And the woman will hasten and run, and announce to her man, and will say to him, Behold, the man was seen to me who came in the day to me.
{13:11} And Manoah will rise and will go after his wife, and will come to the man, and will say to him, Thou the man who spake to the woman? and he will say, I.
{13:12} And Manoah will say, Now shall come thy words. What shall be the judgment of the boy, and his work?
{13:13} And the messenger of Jehovah will say to Manoah, From all I said to the woman she shall watch.
{13:14} From all going forth from the vine of the wine she shall not eat, and wine and strong drink she shall not drink, and any thing unclean she shall not eat: all which I commanded she shall watch.
{13:15} And Manoah will say to the messenger of Jehovah, We will detain thee now, and we will do before thee a kid of the goats.
{13:16} And the messenger of Jehovah will say to Manoah, If thou shalt detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou shalt do a burnt-offering thou shalt do it to Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was a messenger of Jehovah.
{13:17} And Manoah will say to the messenger of Jehovah, What thy name, when shall come thy words and we honored thee?
{13:18} And the messenger of Jehovah will say to him, Wherefore this wilt thou ask for my name, and it is wonderful?
{13:19} And Manoah will take a kid of the goats, and the gift, and will bring up, upon the rock to Jehovah; and he separating to do, and Manoah and his wife seeing.
{13:20} And it will be in the going up of the flame from the altar to the heavens, and the messenger of Jehovah will go up in the flame of the altar and Manoah and his wife seeing; and they will fall upon their face to the earth.
{13:21} And the messenger of Jehovah will no more add to be seen to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he is the messenger of Jehovah.
{13:22} And Manoah will say to his wife, Dying, we shall die, because we saw God.
{13:23} And his wife will say to him, If Jehovah were inclined to put us to death, he took not from our hand a burnt-offering and gift, and he shewed us not all these, and as now caused us not to hear such as this.
{13:24} And the woman will bear a son, and she will call his name Samson. And the boy will grow, and Jehovah will bless him.
{13:25} And the spirit of Jehovah will begin to move him in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and between Eshtaol.
{14:1} And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath from the daughters of Philisteim.
{14:2} And he will go up and announce to his father and his mother, and will say, I saw a woman in Timnath from the daughters of Philisteim: and now take her to me for a wife.
{14:3} And his father will say to him, and his mother, Is there not among the daughters of thy brethren, and among all my people, a woman, that thou goest to take a woman from uncircumcised Philisteim? And Samson will say to his father, Take her to me, for she is straight in mine eyes.
{14:4} And his father and his mother knew not that it was from Jehovah that he seeking an occasion from Philisteim; for in this time Philisteim was ruling over Israel.
{14:5} And Samson will go down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and they will come even to the vineyards of Timnath: and behold, a young lion roared at his meeting.
{14:6} And the spirit of Jehovah will fall suddenly upon him, and he will rend him as rending a kid, and nothing whatever in his hand: and he announced not to his father and to his mother what he did.
{14:7} And he will go down and speak to the woman, and she will be right in the eyes of Samson.
{14:8} And he will turn back after days to take her, and he will turn aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold, an assembly of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
{14:9} And he will break it off in his hands, and going, will go and eat, and he will go to his father and to his mother, and will give to them, and they will eat: and he announced not to them that from the body of the lion he broke off the honey.
{14:10} And his father will go down to the woman; and Samson will make there a drinking, for so did the young men.
{14:11} And it will be when they saw him, and they will take thirty companions, and they will be with him.
{14:12} And Samson will say to them, I will propose to you an enigma: if announcing, ye shall announce it to me in seven days of the drinking, and ye find out, and I will give to you thirty wide garments and thirty exchanges of garments:
{14:13} And if ye shall not be able to announce to me, and ye give me thirty wide garments and thirty exchanges of garments: and they will say to him, Propose thine enigma and we will hear it.
{14:14} And he will say to them, Out of him eating came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they were not able to announce the enigma in three days.
{14:15} And it will be in the seventh day, and they will say to Samson's wife, Persuade thy man and he shall announce to us the enigma, lest we shall burn thee and thy father's house with fire: did ye not call to us to possess us?
{14:16} And Samson's wife will weep upon him, and will say, Thou only hatedst me and lovedst me not: thou didst propose an enigma to the sons of my people, and to me thou didst not announce it. And he will say to her, Behold, to my father and to my mother I announced it not, and shall I announce to thee?
{14:17} And she will weep upon him seven days which were to them of the drinking: and it will be in the seventh day, and he will announce to her, for she urged him: and she will announce the enigma to the sons of her people.
{14:18} And the men of the city will say to him in the seventh day before the sun will go down, What is sweet above honey? and what is strong above the lion? and he will say to them, Unless ye ploughed with my heifer ye found not out my enigma.
{14:19} And the spirit of Jehovah will fall suddenly upon him, and he will go down to Ashkelon and will strike from them thirty men, and he will take their spoils, and will give exchanges to those announcing the enigma. And his anger will kindle, and he will go up to his father's house.
{14:20} And Samson's wife will be to his companion who was friend to him.
{15:1} And it will be after days in days of the wheat harvest, and Samson will look after his wife with a kid of the goats; and he will say, I will go to my wife to the chamber. And her father gave him not to go in.
{15:2} And her father will say, Saying, I said that hating, thou didst hate her, and I will give her to thy companion: is not her small sister good above her? Now she shall be to thee in her stead.
{15:3} And Samson will say to them, This time I was more blameless than Philisteim if I shall do evil with them.
{15:4} And Samson will go and will take three hundred foxes, and will take torches, and will turn tail to tail, and will put one torch between two tails in the midst.
{15:5} And he will kindle fire upon the torches and will send into the standing grain of Philisteim, and will burn up from the heap of sheaves and even to the standing grain, and even to the vineyard and the olive.
{15:6} And Philisteim will say, Who did this? and they will say, Samson, son-in-law of the Timnite, for he took his wife and he will give her to his companion. And Philisteim will go up and will burn her and her father with fire.
{15:7} And Samson will say to them, If ye will do according to this, if I was avenged by you, and afterward I will desist.
{15:8} And he will strike them leg upon thigh, a great smiting. And he will go down and dwell in the cleft of the rock Etam.
{15:9} And Philisteim will go up and encamp against Judah and will be dispersed in Lehi.
{15:10} And the men of Judah will say to them, Why came ye up against us? and they will say, To bind Samson we came up, to do to him as he did to us.
{15:11} And three thousand men of Judah will go down to the cleft of the rock Etam, and they will say to Samson, Knewest thou not that Philisteim is ruling over us? and what this thou didst to us? and he will say to them, As they did to me, so did I to them.
{15:12} And they will say to him, To bind thee we came down, to give thee into the hand of Philisteim. And Samson will say to them, Swear to me lest ye shall fall upon me yourselves.
{15:13} And they will say to him, saying, No; but binding, we will bind thee and give thee into their hand: and killing, we will not kill thee. And they will bind him with two new cords and will bring him up from the rock.
{15:14} He came even to Lehi, and Philisteim shouted at his meeting: and the spirit of Jehovah will come suddenly upon him, and the cords which were upon his arms will be as flax which was burnt in fire, and his bands will melt from off his hands.
{15:15} And he will find the jaw-bone of an ass, fresh, and he will stretch forth his hand and take it and will strike with it a thousand men.
{15:16} And Samson will say, With the jaw-bone of the ass, a heap, two heaps, with the jaw-bone of the ass I struck a thousand men.
{15:17} And it will be when he finished to speak, and he will cast away the jawbone from his hand, and he will call that place, the lifting up the jaw-bone.
{15:18} And he will thirst greatly, and he will call to Jehovah and will say, Thou gavest into the hand of thy servant this great salvation, and now shall I die with thirst and fall into the hand of Philisteim?
{15:19} And God will rend the socket which is in the jaw-bone, and waters will come forth from it; and he will drink, and his spirit will turn back, and he will live. For this he called its name, the Fountain of him Calling, which is in Lehi even to this day.
{15:20} And he will judge Israel in the days of Philisteim twenty years.
{16:1} And Samson will go to Gaza, and he will see there a woman, a harlot, and he will go in to her.
{16:2} To the Gazites, saying, Samson came here. And they will encompass, and will lie in wait for him all the night in the gate of the city, and they will be silent all the night, saying, During the light of the morning and we killed him.
{16:3} And Samson will lie till half the night, and he will rise in half the night, and he will seize the doors of the gate of the city and with the two door-posts, and will remove them with the bar, and will set upon his shoulders, and he will bring them up to the head of the mountain which is upon the face of Hebron.
{16:4} And it will be after this, and he will love a woman in the valley of Shorek, and her name Delilah.
{16:5} And the princes of Philisteim will come up and will say to her, Persuade him, and see in what is his great strength, and in what we shall prevail against him, and bind him to humble him: and we give to thee each a thousand and a hundred of silver.
{16:6} And Delilah will say to Samson, Announce now to me in what is thy great strength, and in what thou shalt be bound to humble thee.
{16:7} And Samson will say to her, If they shall bind me with seven moist cords that were not dried, and I was weak and shall be as another man.
{16:8} And the princess of Philisteim will bring up to her seven moist cords which were not dried, and she will bind him with them.
{16:9} And lying in wait dwelling by her in the chamber. And she will say to him, Philisteim upon thee, Samson. And he will tear away the cords as a thread of tow will be torn away in its smelling the fire. And his strength was not known.
{16:10} And Delilah will say to Samson, Behold, thou deceivest me, and thou wilt speak to me lies: this time announce to me now in what thou shalt be bound.
{16:11} And he will say to her, If binding, they shall bind me with new cords which work was not done with them, and I was weak and was as another man.
{16:12} And Delilah will take new cords and will bind him with them, and she will say to him, Philisteim upon thee, Samson, (and the lier in wait dwelling in the chamber.) And he will tear them away from off his arms as a thread.
{16:13} And Delilah will say to Samson, Till now thou deceivedst me, and thou wilt speak to me lies: announce to me in what thou shalt be bound. And he will say to her, If thou shalt weave the seven braids of my head with the warp.
{16:14} And she will fasten with a peg, and she will say to him, Philisteim upon thee, Samson. And he will awake from his sleep, and he will tear away the peg of the braid and the warp.
{16:15} And she will say to him, Wilt thou say, I loved thee, and thy heart not with me? This three times thou didst deceive me, and didst not announce to me in what is thy great strength.
{16:16} And it will be in her pressing upon him with her words all the days, and she will urge him, and his soul will be shortened to death;
{16:17} And he will announce to her all his heart, and he will say to her, A razor came not up upon my head, for I am devoted to God from my mother's womb: if I were shaved, and my strength removed from me, and I was weak, and was as all men.
{16:18} And Delilah will see that he announced to her all his heart, and she will send and call to the princes of Philisteim, saying, Come up to me this time; for he announced to her all his heart And the princes of Philisteim will come up to her, and will bring up the silver in their hand.
{16:19} And she will cause him to sleep upon her knees; and she will call to a man, and she will shave the seven braids of his head; and she will begin to humble him, and his strength will remove from him.
{16:20} And she will say, Philisteim upon thee, Samson. And he will awake from his sleep, and say, I will go forth as once upon once, and shake myself. And he knew not that Jehovah removed from him.
{16:21} And Philisteim will seize him, and they will bore out his eyes, and will bring him down to Gaza and bind him with fetters of brass, and he will be grinding in the house of bonds.
{16:22} And the hair of his head will begin to grow as when he was shaven.
{16:23} And the princes of Philisteim gathered together to sacrifice a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice: and they will say, Our god gave into our hand Samson our enemy.
{16:24} And the people will see him and praise their god, for they said, God gave into our hand our enemy, and him destroying our land, and who multiplied our wounded.
{16:25} And it will be when their heart will be joyful, and they will say, Call to Samson, and he shall play to us. And they will call to Samson from the house of bonds and he will play before them, and they will set him between the pillars.
{16:26} And Samson will say to the boy holding him by his hand, Permit me and I shall feel the pillars which the house stood upon them, and I will lean upon them.
{16:27} And the house was filled with men and women, and there were all the princes of Philisteim, and upon the roof about three thousand men and women looking upon the sport of Samson.
{16:28} And Samson will call to Jehovah, and will say, Lord Jehovah, remember me now, and strengthen me now but this once, O God, and I will avenge myself one vengeance for my two eyes of Philisteim.
{16:29} And Samson will clasp the two pillars the midst of which the house stood upon them, and he stayed himself upon them, one with his right hand and one with his left.
{16:30} And Samson will say, My soul shall die with Philisteim. And he will bow with strength, and the house will fall upon the princes and upon all the people which are in it And the dead will be more which he killed in his death than which he killed in his life.
{16:31} And his brethren and all the house of his father will go down and will lift him up, and will bring him up, and bury him between Zorah and between Eshtaol in the grave of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.
{17:1} And there will be a man of mount Ephraim and his name Micah.
{17:2} And he will say to his mother, The thousand and one hundred of silver which was taken for thee, and thou cursedst me, and saidst also in mine ears, behold, the silver with me; I took it And his mother will say, Blessed my son to Jehovah.
{17:3} And he will turn back the thousand and hundred of silver to his mother, and his mother will say, Consecrating, I consecrated the silver to Jehovah from my hand to my son, to make a carved thing and a molten: and now I will turn it back to thee.
{17:4} And he will turn back the silver to his mother; and his mother will take two hundred of silver and will give it to the goldsmith, and he will make it a carved thing and molten: and it will be in the house of Micah.
{17:5} And the man Micah to him a house of gods; and he will make an ephod and a teraphim, and he will fill the hand of one of his sons, and he will be to him for priest.
{17:6} In those days not a king in Israel, as man will do the right in his eyes.
{17:7} And there will be a youth from the House of Bread, of Judah, from the families of Judah, and he a Levite, and he sojourned there.
{17:8} And the man will go from the city from the House of Bread, of Judah, to sojourn wherever he shall find: and he will come to mount Ephraim, even to the house of Micah, to make his way.
{17:9} And Micah will say to him, Whence shalt thou come? and the Levite will say to him, I am from the House of Bread, of Judah, and I go to sojourn where I shall find.
{17:10} And Micah will say to him, Dwell with me, and be to me for a father and for a priest, and I will give to thee ten of silver for days, and an equipment of garments, and means of life. And the Levite will go in.
{17:11} And the Levite will be willing to dwell with the man; and the youth will be to him as one of his sons.
{17:12} And Micah will fill the hand of the Levite; and the youth will be to him for a priest, and he will be in the house of Micah.
{17:13} And Micah will say, Now I knew that Jehovah will be good to me, for there being to me the Levite for priest.
{18:1} In those days no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites seeking for himself an inheritance to dwell in; for he fell not into an inheritance for himself in the midst of the tribes of Israel till that day.
{18:2} And the sons of Dan will send from their families five men from their extremities, men sons of power, from Zorah and Eshtaol, to search the land and to examine it; and they will say to them, Go and examine the land: and they will come to mount Ephraim, even to the house of Micah, and they will lodge there.
{18:3} And they with the house of Micah, and they knew the voice of the youth, the Levite: and they will turn aside there and say to him, Who brought thee hither? and what didst thou in here? and what to thee here?
{18:4} And he will say to them, according to this, and according to this, Micah did to me, and he will hire me, and I to him for priest.
{18:5} And they will say to him, Ask now of God, and we shall know whether our way shall prosper which we go upon it.
{18:6} And the priest will say to them, Go for peace: before Jehovah, your way which ye shall go in it.
{18:7} And the five men will go and come to Laish, and they will see the people which in the midst of her, dwelling in confidence according to the judgment of the Sidonians, quiet and confiding; and none shaming the word in the land, a possessor heaping up, and they far off from the Sidonians, and the word was not to them with man.
{18:8} And they will come to their brethren of Zorah and Eshtaol; and their brethren will say to them, What ye?
{18:9} And they will say, Arise, and we will go up upon them: for we saw the land, and behold, exceedingly good: and ye being still, ye shall not neglect to go, to come to inherit the land.
{18:10} In your going, ye shall come to a people confiding, and to a land of many hands: for God gave it into your hand, a place where no want there of any word which is in the earth.
{18:11} And they will remove from thence from the families of the Danites, and from Zorah and from Eshtaol, six hundred men girded with weapons of war.
{18:12} And they will go up and encamp in the City of Forests, in Judah: for this they called that place the camp of Dan, even to this day: behold, it behind the City of Forests.
{18:13} And they will pass from thence to mount Ephraim, and they will come even to the house of Micah.
{18:14} And the five men going to search the land of Laish will answer and say to their brethren, Knew ye that there is in these houses an ephod, and a teraphim, and a carved thing, and a molten? and now know ye what ye will do.
{18:15} And they will turn aside there and come to the house of the youth the Levite, of the house of Micah, and they will ask him for peace.
{18:16} And the six hundred men girded with their weapons of war, stood at the door, which were of the sons of Dan.
{18:17} And the five men having gone to search the land will go up; they will come in there; they took the carved thing and the ephod, and the teraphim and the molten thing: and the priest stood at the door of the gate, and the six hundred men girded with weapons of war.
{18:18} And these came in to Micah's house, and they will take the carved thing, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten thing; and the priest will say to them, What are ye doing?
{18:19} And they will say to him, Be silent; put thy hand upon thy mouth and go with us, and be to us for father and for priest: is it good for thee to be priest to the house of one man, or for thee to be priest to a tribe and to a family in Israel?
{18:20} And the priest's heart will be joyous, and he will take the ephod, and the teraphim, and the carved thing, and will go in the midst of the people.
{18:21} And they will turn and go and put the little ones and the cattle and the wealth before them.
{18:22} They were far off from the house of Micah, and the men that were in the houses which were with the house of Micah, were called together, and they will overtake the sons of Dan.
{18:23} And they will call to the sons of Dan, and they will turn their faces and say to Micah, What to thee that thou criedst out?
{18:24} And he will say, My gods which I made, ye took away, and the priest, and ye will go: and what to me yet? and what this ye will say to me, What to thee?
{18:25} And the sons of Dan will say to him, Thy voice shall not be heard with us lest men bitter of soul shall strike upon you, and thy soul was taken away, and the soul of thy house.
{18:26} And the sons of Dan will go to their way: and Micah will see that they were strong above him, and he will turn and turn back to his house.
{18:27} And they took what Micah made, and the priest which was to him, and they will go to Laish, upon a people quiet and confiding: and they will strike them with the mouth of the sword, and they will burn the city with fire.
{18:28} And there was none delivering, for it was far off from Sidon, and the word was not to them with man; and it is in the valley which is to the house of the street And they will build the city and dwell in it.
{18:29} And they will call the name of the city, Dan, in the name of Dan their father, who will be born to Israel. And yet Laish the name of the city at first.
{18:30} And the sons of Dan will raise up to them the carved thing: and Jonathan, son of Gershom, son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Danites even to the day of the captivity of the land.
{18:31} And they will set up to them Micah's carved thing, which he made, all the days the home of God was in Shiloh.
{19:1} And it will be in those days, and no king in Israel; and it will be a man, a Levite, sojourning in the sides of mount Ephraim, and he will take to him a wife, a concubine, from the House of Bread, of Judah.
{19:2} And his concubine will commit fornication against him, and she will go from him to the house of her father, to the House of Bread, of Judah, and she will be there the days of four months.
{19:3} And her husband will rise and go after her to speak to her heart, to turn it back; and his young man with him and a pair of asses: and she will bring him into her father's house; and the father of the girl will see him and will rejoice at his meeting.
{19:4} And his father-in-law, the girl's father, will hold fast upon him, and he will dwell with, him three days: and they will eat and drink and lodge there.
{19:5} And it will be in the fourth day, and they will rise early in the morning, and he will rise up to go: and the girl's father will say to his son-in-law, Strengthen thine heart with a bit of bread, and afterward ye shall go.
{19:6} And they will sit down and eat, they two together, and drink: and the girl's father will say to the man, Be willing, now, and lodge, and do good to thy heart.
{19:7} And the man will rise up to go, and his father-in-law will press upon him, and he will sit down and lodge there.
{19:8} And he will rise early in the morning in the fifth day, to go, and the girl's father will say, Strengthen now thy heart. And they lingered till the day declined, and they two will eat.
{19:9} And the man will rise to go, he and his concubine and his boy; and his father-in-law, the girl's father, will say to him, Behold, now, the day weakened toward evening; lodge now: behold, the declining of the day; lodge here, and thy heart shall be joyous; and rise early to-morrow to your way and go to thy tent.
{19:10} And the man was not willing to lodge, and he will rise and go, and, come even to the front of Jebus; this is Jerusalem: and with him a pair of asses saddled, and his concubine with him.
{19:11} They with Jebus, and the day gone down greatly; and the youth will say to his lord, Go, now, and we will turn to this city of the Jebusites, and we will lodge in it.
{19:12} And his lord will say to him, We will not turn into a strange city which is not of the sons of Israel here; and we passed over even to Gibeah.
{19:13} And he will say to his boy, Go, and we will come near to one of the places and lodge in Gibeah or in Ramah.
{19:14} And they will pass over and will go; and the sun will go down to them near Gibeah which is to Benjamin.
{19:15} And they will turn aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah: and he will go in and sit down in the street of the city, and no man receiving them to the house to lodge.
{19:16} And behold, an old man came in from his work out of the field in the evening, and the man from mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeab; and the men of the place, sons of the Jaminite.
{19:17} And he will lift up his eyes and will see the man of the way in the street of the city: and the old man will say, Whither wilt thou go? and from whence wilt thou come?
{19:18} And he will say to him, We are passing from the House of Bread of Judah, even to the sides of mount Ephraim, from whence I am. And I will go to the House of Bread of Judah, and to the house of Jehovah; I went, and no man receiving me to his house.
{19:19} And there is also straw, also fodder for our asses; and also there is bread and wine to me and to thy maid and to the boy with thy servants: no want of any word.
{19:20} And the old man will say, Peace to thee: only all thy want upon me; only in the street thou shalt not lodge.
{19:21} And he will bring him to his house, and will bring for the asses: and they will wash their feet, and eat and drink.
{19:22} They doing good to their heart, and behold, the men of the city, men of the sons of Belial, encompassed the house, knocking upon the door; and they will say to the man, the lord of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man which came into thy house, and we will know him.
{19:23} And the man, the lord of the house, will go forth to them, and will say to them, Nay, my brethren, ye will not do evil; after that this man came into my house ye will not do this folly.
{19:24} Behold, my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; I will bring them forth now, and humble ye them, and do to them the good in your eyes: and to this man ye will not do the word of this folly.
{19:25} And the men were not willing to hear to him: and the man will lay hold upon his concubine and will bring out to them without, and they will know her, and will gratify their desires upon her all the night, even till morning: and they will send her away in the ascending of the dawn.
{19:26} And the woman will come at the turning of the morning and she will fall at the door of the house where her lord there, even till the light.
{19:27} And her lord will rise in the morning and will open the doors of the house and will come forth to go to his way, and behold, the woman his concubine, fallen at the door of the house, and her hands upon the threshold.
{19:28} And he will say to her, Arise, and go. And none answered. And he will take her upon the ass, and the man will rise and go to his place.
{19:29} And he will come to his house and will take a knife, and will lay hold upon his concubine, and he will give her, even to her bones, into twelve pieces, and he will send her into all the bound of Israel.
{19:30} And it was, all seeing and saying, It was not, and it was not seen according to this from the day of the coming up of the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt till this day: consider for yourselves upon it; take counsel and speak.
{20:1} And all the sons of Israel will go forth, and the assembly will be gathered together as one man, from Dan even to the Well of the Oath, and the land of Gilead to Jehovah to Mizpeh.
{20:2} And the chiefs of all the people of all the tribes of Israel will be drawn out in the gathering of the people of God, four hundred thousand men, footmen, drawing swords.
{20:3} And the sons of Benjamin will hear that the sons of Israel went up to Mizpeh. And the sons of Israel will say, Speak ye; how was this evil?
{20:4} And the man the Levite will answer, the husband of the woman slain, and he will say, To Gibeah which is to the sons of Benjamin I came, I and my concubine to lodge.
{20:5} And the lords of Gibeah will rise upon me and will encompass the house against me by night; they purposed to kill me: and my concubine they humbled, and she died.
{20:6} And I laid hold of my concubine and I cut her in pieces, and sent her into all the field of the inheritance of Israel: for they did wickedness and folly in Israel.
{20:7} Behold, all ye sons of Israel; give for yourselves the word and counsel here.
{20:8} And all the people will rise as one man, saying, We will not go a man to his tent, and we will not turn aside a man to his house:
{20:9} And now this the word which we will do to Gibeah against her by lot.
{20:10} And we will take ten men to the hundred to all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred to a thousand, and a thousand to ten thousand, to take provision for the people, to do for those going to Gibeah of Benjamin; according to all the folly which was done in Israel.
{20:11} And they will be gathered together every man of Israel against the city, associated as one man.
{20:12} And the tribes of Israel will send men into all the tribes of Benjamin, saying, What this evil which was among you?
{20:13} And now give the men, sons of Belial, which are in Gibeah, and we will put them to death, and take away evil from Israel. And Benjamin would not hear to the voice of their brethren the sons of Israel.
{20:14} And the sons of Benjamin will be gathered together from the cities to Gibeah to go out to war with the sons of Israel.
{20:15} And the sons of Benjamin will be reviewed in that day from the cities, twenty and six thousand men drawing the sword, besides from the inhabitants of Gibeah they were reviewed, seven hundred chosen men.
{20:16} From all this people, seven hundred chosen men shut up of the right hand, slinging at a hair, and they will not miss.
{20:17} And the men of Israel were reviewed, beside Benjamin, four hundred thousand men drawing sword: all these men of war.
{20:18} And the sons of Israel will rise and will go up to the house of God and will ask in God, and will say, Who shall go up for us in the beginning to war with the sons of Benjamin? and Jehovah will say, Judah in the beginning.
{20:19} And the sons of Israel will rise in the morning and will encamp against Gibeah.
{20:20} And the men of Israel will go forth to war with Benjamin; and the men of Israel will prepare to war with them at Gibeah.
{20:21} And the sons of Benjamin will come forth from Gibeah, and they will destroy in that day in Israel twenty and two thousand men to the earth.
{20:22} And the people, the men of Israel, will strengthen themselves, and they will add to prepare war in the place which they set in array in the first day.
{20:23} And the sons of Israel will go up and will weep before Jehovah till the evening, and they will ask in Jehovah, saying, Shall I add to draw near to war with the sons of Benjamin my brother? And Jehovah will say, Go up against him.
{20:24} And the sons of Israel will come near to the sons of Benjamin in the second day.
{20:25} And Benjamin will go forth to their meeting from Gibeah in the second day, and they will destroy of the sons of Israel yet eighteen thousand men to the earth; all these drawing the sword.
{20:26} And all the sons of Israel and all the people will go up, and they will come to the house of God, and they will weep, and they will sit there before Jehovah, and they will fast in that day till the evening, and they will bring up burnt-offerings and peace before Jehovah.
{20:27} And the sons of Israel will ask in Jehovah, (and there the ark of the covenant of God in those days,
{20:28} And Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I add yet to go forth to war with the sons of Benjamin my brother, or shall I desist? And Jehovah will say, Go up; for to-morrow I will give him into thy hand.
{20:29} And Israel will put liers-in-wait against Gibeah round about.
{20:30} And the sons of Israel will go up to the sons of Benjamin in the third day, and they will set in array against Gibeah as once upon once.
{20:31} And the sons of Benjamin will come forth to the meeting of the people, they were separated from the city; and they will begin to strike of the people wounded as once upon once, in the highways, which one went up to the house of God, and one to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men in Israel.
{20:32} And the sons of Benjamin will say, They are smitten before us as at first. And the sons of Israel said, We will flee, and draw him away from the city to the highways.
{20:33} And all the men of Israel rose up from his place and set in array against Baal-Tamar: and the ambush of Israel rushing forth from its place from the naked place of Gibeah.
{20:34} And there will come forth from before against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men from all Israel, and the battle was heavy: and they knew not that evil touched upon them.
{20:35} And Jehovah will smite Benjamin before Israel: and the sons of Israel will destroy of Benjamin in that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men: all these drawing sword.
{20:36} And the sons of Benjamin will see that they were smitten: and the men of Israel will give place to Benjamin, for they trusted to the ambush which they put by Gibeah.
{20:37} And the ambush hasted, and they will spread out against Gibeah; and the ambush will draw out and will strike all the city with the mouth of the sword.
{20:38} And there was an appointment to the men of Israel with the ambush for them to raise up a great ascending of smoke from the city.
{20:39} And the men of Israel will turn about in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike the wounded among the men of Israel, about thirty men: for they said, Surely, smiting, he was smitten as the first battle.
{20:40} And the ascending began to go up from the city of the pillar of smoke, and Benjamin will turn behind, and behold, the whole city ascended up to the heavens.
{20:41} And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin will hasten, for they saw that evil touched upon them.
{20:42} And they turned before the men of Israel to the way of the desert; and the battle overtook them; and those from the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.
{20:43} They surrounded Benjamin, pursuing him from Nohah, treading him down even to the front of Gibeah, from the rising of the sun.
{20:44} And there will fall of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these men of strength.
{20:45} And they will turn and flee to the desert, to the rock Rimmon: and they will glean in the highways five thousand men; and they will pursue after him even to Gidom, and will strike of him two thousand men.
{20:46} And all those falling of Benjamin will be twenty and five thousand men drawing sword in that day; all these men of strength.
{20:47} And there will turn and flee to the desert to the rock Rimmon, six hundred men, and they will dwell in the rock Rimmon four months.
{20:48} And the men of Israel turned back against the sons of Benjamin, and they will strike them with the mouth of the sword, from the city, the men even to cattle, all being found: also all the cities being found they set on fire.
{21:1} And the men of Israel sware in Mizpeh, saying, A man from us shall not give his daughter to Benjamin for wife.
{21:2} And the people will go to the house of God and will sit there even till evening, before God; and they will lift up their voice and weep a great weeping.
{21:3} And they will say, Wherefore, Jehovah, God of Israel, was this in Israel to miss one tribe this day from Israel?
{21:4} And it will be on the morrow, and the people will rise early and they will build there an altar, and will bring up burnt-offerings and peace.
{21:5} And the sons of Israel will say, Who from all the tribes of Israel that went not up in the gathering to Jehovah? For there was a great oath against him who went not up to Jehovah to Mizpeh, saying, Dying, he shall die.
{21:6} And the sons of Israel will lament for Benjamin their brother, and they will say, There was cut off this day one tribe from Israel.
{21:7} What shall we do for them to those being left for wives, and we sware by Jehovah not to give to them from our daughters for wives?
{21:8} And they will say, What one from the tribes of Israel who came not up to Jehovah to Mizpeh? And behold, not a man came from the camp of Jabesh-Gilead to the gathering.
{21:9} And the people will be reviewed, and behold, not a man there from the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead.
{21:10} And they will send there twelve thousand men from the sons of power, and they will command them, saying, Go and smite them, the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead, with the mouth of the sword, and the women and the little ones.
{21:11} And this the word which ye shall do: every male and every woman knowing the bed of a male ye shall exterminate.
{21:12} And they will find of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead four hundred girls, virgins, who knew not man by the bed of a male: and they will bring them to the camp of Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan.
{21:13} And all the assembly will send and speak to the sons of Benjamin who were in the rock Rimmon, and they will call peace to them.
{21:14} And Benjamin will turn back in that time; and they will give them the women which they saved alive from the women of Jabesh-Gilead: and they found for them not thus.
{21:15} And the people lamented for Benjamin, because Jehovah made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
{21:16} And the old men of the assembly will say, What shall we do for those remaining for wives, for the women were destroyed from Benjamin?
{21:17} And they will say, An inheritance for the escaped to Benjamin, and a tribe shall not be destroyed from Israel.
{21:18} And we shall not be able to give to them wives from our daughters, for the sons of Israel sware, saying, Cursed he giving a wife to Benjamin.
{21:19} And they will say, Behold, a festival of Jehovah in Shiloh from days to days, which is from the north to the house of God, from the rising of the sun to the highway going from the house of God to Shechem, and from the south to Lebonah.
{21:20} And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, Go, and lie in wait in the vineyards;
{21:21} And see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh shall come forth to dance in dances, and come ye out from the vineyards and catch for yourselves each his wife from the daughters of Shiloh) and go to the land of Benjamin.
{21:22} And it was when their fathers or brothers shall come to contend against us, and we said to them, Be merciful to us with them, because we took not a man his wife in the battle; for ye gave not to them according to the time, ye shall transgress.
{21:23} And the sons of Benjamin will do so, and they will take wives for their number from those dancing, which they took by force: and they will go and turn back to their inheritance, and they will build cities, and they will dwell in them.
{21:24} And the sons of Israel will go from there in that time, a man to his tribe and to his family, and they will go forth from there, a man to his inheritance.
{21:25} In those days no king in Israel: a man will do the right in his eyes.
