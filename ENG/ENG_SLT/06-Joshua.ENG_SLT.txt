{1:1} And it will be after the death of Moses, the servant of Jehovah, Jehovah will say to Joshua, son of Nun, serving Moses, saying,
{1:2} Moses my servant died; and now arise, pass through this Jordan, thou and all this people, to the land which I gave to them to the sons of Israel.
{1:3} Every place which the sole of your foot shall tread upon it, to you I gave it as I spake to Moses.
{1:4} From the desert and this Lebanon, and even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and even to the great sea, from the going down of the sun, shall be your bound.
{1:5} No man shall stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, I will be with thee: I will not forsake thee and I will not leave thee.
{1:6} Be strong and be active; for thou shalt cause Israel to inherit the land which I sware to their fathers to give to them.
{1:7} Only be strong and be greatly active, to watch to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee: thou shalt not turn aside from it to the right and to the left, so that thou shalt be wise in all things where thou shalt go.
{1:8} And the book of this law shall not depart from thy mouth; and meditate thou in it day and night, so that thou shalt watch to do according to all written in it: for then thou shalt prosper thy ways, and then thou shalt be wise.
{1:9} Did I not command thee? Be strong and be active; thou shalt not fear and thou shalt not bend: for Jehovah thy God is with thee in all where thou shalt go.
{1:10} And Joshua will command the scribes of the people, saying,
{1:11} Pass through in the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, Prepare to yourselves food, for yet three days ye pass through this Jordan to go to possess the land which Jehovah your God gave to you to inherit it.
{1:12} And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said, saying,
{1:13} Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God causes you to rest, and he gave to you this land.
{1:14} Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall dwell in the land which Moses gave to you on the other side Jordan; and ye shall pass over, being brave, before your brethren, all being strong, of the host, and help them;
{1:15} Till Jehovah shall cause rest to your brethren as you and they also shall inherit the land which Jehovah your God gave to them: and ye turned back to the land of your possession, and ye shall inherit it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave to you on the other side of Jordan from the rising of the sun.
{1:16} And they will answer Joshua, saying, All which thou didst command us, we will do, and where thou shalt send us, we will go.
{1:17} According to all that we heard to Moses, so will we bear to thee: only Jehovah thy God shall be with thee as he was with Moses.
{1:18} Every man who shall resist thy mouth, and shall not hear thy words according to all which thou shalt command him, he shall die: only be strong and be active.
{2:1} And Joshua son of Nun will send out of Shittim two men spying silently, saying, Go see the land and Jericho. And they will go, and will come to the house of a woman, a harlot, and her name Rahab; and they will lie there.
{2:2} And it will be said to the king of Jericho, Behold, men came here this night from the sons of Israel to search out the land.
{2:3} And the king of Jericho will send to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men having come to thee, which came to thy house: for to search out the land they came.
{2:4} And the woman will take the two men and hide them, and will say thus, Two men came to me, and I knew not from whence they were.
{2:5} And it will be for the shutting the gate in darkness, and the men went forth, and I knew not whither the men went; pursue quickly after them, for ye shall overtake them.
{2:6} And she brought them up to the roof, and she will hide them in woody flax arranged by her upon the roof.
{2:7} And the men pursued after them the way of Jordan at the passages: and they shut the gate afterwards as they pursuing after them went forth.
{2:8} And before they will lie down; and she went up to them upon the roof;
{2:9} And she will say to the men, I knew that Jehovah gave to you the land, and that your terror fell upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melted from your face.
{2:10} For we heard that Jehovah dried up the water of the sea of sedge from before you, in your coming out of Egypt; and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites that were upon the other side of Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom ye destroyed them.
{2:11} And hearing, our heart will melt and there rose up no more spirit in a man on account of your face: For Jehovah your God, he the God in the heavens from above and upon the earth beneath.
{2:12} And now, swear now to me by Jehovah, as I did with you mercy, and do ye also mercy with the house of my father, and give to me a true sign.
{2:13} And preserve alive my father and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all which is to them, and take away our souls from death.
{2:14} And the men will say to her, Our soul instead of yours to die if ye shall not announce this our word. And it being in Jehovah's giving to us the land, and we did with thee mercy and truth.
{2:15} And she will let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was upon the wall side and she will dwell upon the wall.
{2:16} And she will say to them, Go to the mountain, lest they pursuing shall meet with you; and hide yourselves there three days till they pursuing turn back: and afterward ye shall go to your way.
{2:17} And the men will say to her, We are free from this thine oath which thou caused us to swear.
{2:18} Behold, we come into the land, thou shalt bind the line of this scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by it: and thy father and thy mother and thy brethren, and all thy father's house thou shalt gather to thee to the house.
{2:19} And it was all which went forth out of the doors of thy house without, his blood upon his head and we are free, and all which shall be with thee in the house, his blood upon our head if a hand shall be upon him.
{2:20} And if thou shalt announce this our word, and we were free from thine oath which thou didst cause us to swear.
{2:21} And she will say, According to your words so be it. And she will send them away and they will go: and she will bind the scarlet cord in the window.
{2:22} And they will go, and will come to the mountain, and will dwell there three days till they pursuing turned back: and they pursuing will seek in all the way, and they found not.
{2:23} And the two men will turn back and come down from the mountain, and will pass over, and will come to Joshua the son of Nun, and will recount to him all things having found them.
{2:24} And they will say to Joshua that Jehovah gave into our hand all the land; and also all the inhabitants of the land melted from before us.
{3:1} And Joshua will rise early in the morning; and they will remove from Shittim and they will come even to Jordan, he and all the sons of Israel, and they will pass the night there before they will pass over.
{3:2} And it will be from the end of three days and the scribes will pass through in the midst of the camp.
{3:3} And they will command the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites lifting it up, and ye shall remove from your place and go after it.
{3:4} But it shall be far off between you and between it, about two thousand cubits by measure: ye shall not draw near to it so that ye shall know the way which ye shall go in it; for ye passed not through the way from yesterday the third day.
{3:5} And Joshua will say to the people, Consecrate yourselves, for to-morrow Jehovah will do wonderful things in the midst of you.
{3:6} And Joshua will say to the priests, saying, Lift up the ark of the covenant and pass through before the people. And they will lift up the ark of the covenant and will go before the people.
{3:7} And Jehovah will say to Joshua, This day I will begin to make thee great in the eyes of all Israel, that they shall know that as I was with Moses I will be with thee.
{3:8} And thou shalt command the priests lifting up the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye come to the extremity of the water of Jordan ye shall stand in Jordan.
{3:9} And Joshua will say to the sons of Israel, Come near here and hear the words of Jehovah your God.
{3:10} And Joshua will say, By this ye shall know that the living God is in the midst of you; and destroying, he will destroy from your face the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Hivite and the Perizzite and the Girgashite and the Amorite and the Jebusite.
{3:11} Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passing through before you into Jordan.
{3:12} And now take to you twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man, one man to a tribe.
{3:13} And it was as the soles of the feet of the priests lifting up the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, rested in the water of Jordan, the water of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters coming down from above; and they shall stand one heap.
{3:14} And it shall be in the people's removing from their tents to pass through Jordan, and the priests lifting up the ark of the covenant before the people;
{3:15} And as they lifting up the ark come to Jordan, and the feet of the priests lifting up the ark were dipped in the extremity of the waters (and Jordan was filled up to all its banks all the days of harvest,)
{3:16} And the waters coming down from above will stand, they rose up one heap very far off in Adam, the city which is by the side of Zaretan; and coming down upon the sea of the desert, the salt sea, they ceased, they were cut off: and the people passed through over against Jericho.
{3:17} And the priests lifting up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah will stand firm upon the dry land that in the midst of Jordan, and all Israel passing over upon the dry till all the peoples finished to pass over Jordan.
{4:1} And it shall be as all the people finished passing over Jordan, and Jehovah will say to Joshua,
{4:2} Take to you from the people twelve men, one man, one man from a tribe;
{4:3} And command ye them, saying, Take up to you from hence out of the midst of Jordan from the firm standing of the feet of the priests, twelve stones, and pass them over with you, and deposit them in the lodging place where ye shall remain in it the night.
{4:4} And Joshua will call to the twelve men whom he prepared from the sons of Israel, one man, one man from a tribe:
{4:5} And Joshua will say to them, Pass ye over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of Jordan, and lift up to you each one stone upon his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel:
{4:6} So that this shall be a sign in the midst of you, when your sons shall ask to-morrow, saying, What these stones to you?
{4:7} And say ye to them that the waters of Jordan were cut off from before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; in its passing through Jordan the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones were for a remembrance to the sons of Israel even to forever.
{4:8} And the sons of Israel will do so as Joshua commanded, and they will lift up the twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as Jehovah spake to Joshua according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and they will pass them over with them to the lodging place, and they will deposit them there.
{4:9} And Joshua raised up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place of the standing of the feet of the priest lifting up the ark of the covenant: and they shall be there till this day.
{4:10} And the priests lifting up the ark standing in the midst of Jordan, till all was finished which Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all which Moses commanded Joshua: and the people will haste and will pass through.
{4:11} And it will be as all the people finished passing over, and the ark of Jehovah will pass through, and the priests before the people.
{4:12} And the sons of Reuben will pass through, and the sons of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh, brave in battle, before the sons of Israel, as Moses spake to them.
{4:13} About forty thousand drawn out for war, passed over before Jehovah to war, to the desert of Jericho.
{4:14} In that day Jehovah made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel, and they will fear him as they feared Moses all the days of his life.
{4:15} And Jehovah will say to Joshua, saying,
{4:16} Command the priests lifting up the ark of the testimony, and they shall come up out of Jordan.
{4:17} And Joshua will command the priests, saying, Come up out of Jordan.
{4:18} And it will be in the priests lifting up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah coming up from the midst of Jordan, the soles of the feet of the priests were plucked up to the dry land, and the waters of Jordan will turn back to their place and will go as yesterday the third day, over all its banks.
{4:19} And the people came up out of Jordan in the tenth to the first month, and they will encamp in Gilgal, in the extremity of the sunrising of Jericho.
{4:20} And these twelve stones which they took out of Jordan, Joshua set in Gilgal.
{4:21} And he will say to the sons of Israel, saying, When your sons shall ask their fathers to-morrow, saying, What these stones?
{4:22} And make ye known to your sons, saying, Upon dry land Israel passed through this Jordan.
{4:23} That Jehovah your God dried up the water of Jordan from before you till your passing through as Jehovah your God did to the sea of sedge which he dried up from before us till our passing through:
{4:24} So that all the people of the earth knew the hand of Jehovah that it is strong: so that ye shall fear Jehovah your God all the days.
{5:1} And it will be as all the kings of the Amorites heard which were beyond Jordan to the sea, and all the kings of the Canaanites which were upon the sea, that Jehovah dried up the water of Jordan from before the sons of Israel till we passed over, and their heart will melt; and there was no more spirit in them from the face of the sons of Israel.
{5:2} In that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make to thee swords of stone, and turning back, circumcise the sons of Israel the second time.
{5:3} And Joshua will make to him swords of stone and will circumcise the sons of Israel at the hill of uncircumcisions:
{5:4} And this the reason that Joshua circumcised: all the people came forth out of Egypt, the males, all the men of war, died in the desert in the way, in their coming out of Egypt.
{5:5} For all the people coming out were circumcised; and all the people born in the desert in the way, in their coming out of Egypt, were not circumcised.
{5:6} For forty years the sons of Israel went in the desert till all the people of the men of war coming out of Egypt were finished, who heard not to the voice of Jehovah: which Jehovah sware to them, not for them to see the land which Jehovah sware to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing milk and honey.
{5:7} And their sons he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, for they circumcised them not in the way.
{5:8} And it shall be as all the people finished to be circumcised, and they dwelt in their place in the camp till they revived.
{5:9} And Jehovah will say to Joshua, This day I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. And he will call the name of that place Gilgal till this day.
{5:10} And the sons of Israel will encamp in Gilgal, and they will do the passover in the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the plain of Jericho.
{5:11} And they will eat from the grain of the land from the morrow of the passover, unleavened and roasted in the self-same day.
{5:12} And the manna will cease from the morrow in their eating from the grain of the land; and manna was no more to the sons of Israel; and they will eat from the produce of the land of Canaan in that year.
{5:13} And it will be in Joshua's being by Jericho, and he will lift up his eyes and will see, and behold, a man standing before him and his sword drawn in his hand; and Joshua will go to him and say to him, Art thou for us or for our adversaries?
{5:14} And he will say, No; but I chief of the army of Jehovah come now. And Joshua will fall on his face to the earth and will worship him, and will say to him, What speaks my lord to his servant?
{5:15} And the captain of Jehovah's host will say to Joshua, Put off thy shoe from thy foot, for the place which thou standest upon it, it is holy: and Joshua will do so.
{6:1} And Jericho was shut up; and being shut up from before the sons of Israel, none will come out and none came in.
{6:2} And Jehovah will say to Joshua, See, I gave into thy hand Jericho and her king, and the mighty ones of strength.
{6:3} And encompass the city all ye men of war, and surround the city one time: so shalt thou do six days.
{6:4} And seven priests shall lift up seven trumpets of alarms before the ark: and in the seventh day ye shall encompass the city seven times, and the priests shall clang the trumpets.
{6:5} And it was in prolonging upon the horn of the jubilee in your hearing, the voice of the trumpet, and all the people shall shout a great shout: and the walls of the city shall fall under it, and the people went up each before him.
{6:6} And Joshua son of Nun will call to the priests and say to them, Lift up the ark of the covenant, and seven priests shall lift up seven trumpets of signals before the ark of Jehovah.
{6:7} And they will say to the people, Pass through and surround the city, and he being armed shall pass by before the ark of Jehovah.
{6:8} And it will be as Joshua said to the people, and the seven priests lifting up the seven trumpets of alarms before Jehovah, passed by and clanged upon the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went after them.
{6:9} And he being armed, went before the priests that clanged with the trumpets, and the gathering went after the ark, going and clanging with the trumpets.
{6:10} And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, and ye shall not cause your voice to be heard, and a word shall not go forth out of your mouth till the day I said to you, Shout, and shout ye.
{6:11} And the ark of Jehovah will encompass the city, surrounding one time: and they will come into the camp and will pass the night in the camp.
{6:12} And Joshua will rise early in the morning, and the priests will lift up the ark of Jehovah.
{6:13} And seven priests lifting up seven trumpets of alarms before the ark of Jehovah went on going, and they clanged with the trumpets, and he being armed went before them; and the gathering went after the ark of Jehovah, going and clanging with the trumpets.
{6:14} And they will surround the city in the second day one time, and they will turn back to the camp. So they did six days.
{6:15} And it will be in the seventh day, and they will rise early in the ascending of the dawn, and they will encompass the city according to this judgment seven times; only in that day they encompassed the city seven times.
{6:16} And it will be in the seventh time the priests clanged with the trumpets and Joshua will say to the people, Shout; for Jehovah gave to you the city.
{6:17} And the city was devoted, it, and all which is in it, to Jehovah: only Rehab the harlot shall live; she and all which with her in the house, because she hid the messengers which we sent.
{6:18} And ye, watch ye from the devoted thing lest ye shall be devoted, and ye take from the devoted thing and ye set the camp of Israel to be devoted, and ye troubled it.
{6:19} And all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron, it holy to Jehovah: it shall be brought to the treasury of Jehovah.
{6:20} And the people will shout and clang with the trumpets: and it will be as the people heard the voice of the trumpet, and the people will shout a great shout, and the wall will fall under it, and the people will go up to the city, each before him, and they will take the city.
{6:21} And they will devote all which in the city, from man and even to woman, and from the youth even to the old man, and ox and sheep and ass, to the mouth of the sword.
{6:22} And to the two men spying the land Joshua said, Go in to the house of the woman, the harlot, and bring forth from thence the woman and all which is to her, as ye sware to her.
{6:23} And the young men spying will go in and bring forth Rehab, and her father and her mother and her brethren, and all which is to her; and all her families they will bring forth, and they will leave them without the camp of Israel.
{6:24} And they burnt the city in fire and all which is in it: only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and iron they gave to the treasury of the house of Jehovah.
{6:25} And Rahab the harlot, and the house of her father and all which is to her, Joshua preserved alive; and she will dwell in the midst of Israel till this day, because she hid the messengers which Joshua sent out to spy Jericho.
{6:26} And Joshua will swear in that time, saying, Cursed the man before Jehovah who shall rise up and build this city Jericho: in his first-born he shall lay its foundation and in his younger he shall set up its doors.
{6:27} And Jehovah will be with Joshua; and his fame will be in all the land.
{7:1} And the sons of Israel will transgress a transgression in the devoted thing: and Achan, son of Carmi son of Zabdi, son of Zerah to the tribe; of Judah, will take from the devoted thing: and the anger of Jehovah will kindle against the sons of Israel.
{7:2} And Joshua will send men from Jericho to Ai, which is by the house of Ain, from the east, to the house of God, and he will say to them, saying, Go up and spy the land. And the men will go up and will spy Ai.
{7:3} And they will turn back to Joshua, and will say to him, All the people shall not go up; about two thousand men or about three thousand men shall go up and smite Ai: thou shalt not weary there all the people for they few.
{7:4} And they will go up there from the people about three thousand men: and they will flee from the face of the men of Ai.
{7:5} And the men of Ai will smite of them about thirty and six men; and they will pursue them before the gate, even to Shebarim; and they will smite them in going down, and the heart of the people will melt and will be as water.
{7:6} And Joshua will rend his garments and will fall upon his face to the earth before the ark of Jehovah even till evening, he and the old men of Israel; and they will lift up dust upon their heads.
{7:7} And Joshua will say, Ah! Lord Jehovah, wherefore, passing over, didst thou cause this people to pass over Jordan, to give us into the hand of the Amorite, to destroy us? and would we were contented and dwelt on the other side of Jordan.
{7:8} With leave, O Lord, what to say, after that Israel turned back the neck before his enemies.
{7:9} And the Canaanite and all inhabiting the land shall hear, and they encompassed about us, and they cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do to thy great name?
{7:10} And Jehovah will say to Joshua, Rise up; for thyself wherefore this didst thou fall upon thy face?
{7:11} Israel sinned and also passed by my covenant which I commanded them: and also they took from the devoted thing, and also stole, and also lied, and also put in their vessels.
{7:12} And the sons of Israel shall not be able to rise up before their enemies; they will turn the neck before their enemies for they were for a devoted thing: I will not add to be with you if ye ill not destroy the devoted thing from the midst of you.
{7:13} Arise, consecrate the people, and say, Be ye consecrated for the morrow: for thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, A devoted thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou shalt not be able to rise up before thine enemy till your removing the devoted thing from the midst of you.
{7:14} And come near in the morning according to your tribes: and it was the tribe which Jehovah shall take of us shall come near according to the families; and the family which Jehovah shall take shall come near according to houses; and the house which Jehovah shall take shall come near according to the men.
{7:15} And it was he being taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt in fire, he and all which is to him: for he passed by the covenant of Jehovah, and because he did folly in Israel.
{7:16} And Joshua will rise early in the morning, and he will bring Israel near according to his tribes; and he will take the tribe of Judah.
{7:17} And he will bring near the family of Judah; and he will take the family of the Zarhites: and he will bring near the family of the Zarhites according to the men; and Zabdi will be taken.
{7:18} And he will bring near his house according to the men, and Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, to the tribe of Judah, will be taken.
{7:19} And Joshua will say to Achan, My son, set now, honor to Jehovah the God of Israel, and give to him confession; and announce now to me what thou didst; thou shalt not hide from me.
{7:20} And Achan will answer Joshua and will say, Truly, I sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel, and according to this, and according to this I did.
{7:21} And I shall see in the plunder a wide cloak of Shinar, a good one, and two hundred shekels of silver and one tongue of gold of fifty shekels from its weight, and I shall desire them, and shall take them, and behold them hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
{7:22} And Joshua will send messengers, and they will run to the tent, and behold, the hiding in his tent, and the silver under it.
{7:23} And they will take them from the midst of the tent and will bring them to Joshua, and to all the sons of Israel, and they will pour them out before Jehovah.
{7:24} And Joshua will take Achan, the son of Zerah, and the silver and the wide cloak, and the tongue of gold, and his sons and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep and his tent, and all which is to him, and all Israel with him, and they will bring them up to the valley of Achor.
{7:25} And Joshua will say, Why didst thou trouble us? Jehovah will trouble thee in this day, and all Israel will stone him with stone, and they will burn them in fire, and they will stone them with stones.
{7:26} And they will raise up upon him a great heap of stones even till this day. And Jehovah will turn back from the wrath of his anger: for this, the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, even to this day.
{8:1} And Jehovah will say to Joshua, Thou shalt not fear, and thou shalt not be terrified: take with thee all the people of war, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I gave into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people and his city and his land:
{8:2} And do to Ai and to her king as thou didst to Jericho and to her king: only its plunder and her cattle ye shall plunder to yourselves: set to thee an ambush to the city from behind it.
{8:3} And Joshua will rise, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai: and Joshua will choose thirty thousand men mighty of strength, and he will send them by night.
{8:4} And he will command them, saying. See, ye lie in wait against the city, behind the city: ye shall not be far off from the city greatly, and be ye all of you prepared:
{8:5} And I and all the people that are with me will draw near to the city: and it was when they shall come forth to our meeting as at the first, and we fled before them.
{8:6} And they will come out after us, and we drew them away from the city, for they will say, They flee before us as at the first: and we fled before their face.
{8:7} And ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city: and Jehovah your God gave it into your hand.
{8:8} And it was when ye seize the city, ye shall set the city on fire: according to the word of Jehovah ye shall do: See, I commanded you.
{8:9} And Joshua will send them away; and they will go to the ambush, and they will dwell between the house of God and between Ai, from the sea to Ai: and Joshua will remain in that night in the midst of the people.
{8:10} And Joshua will rise early in the morning and will review the people, and he will go up, and the old men of Israel, before the people of Ai.
{8:11} And all the people of war that were with him went up, and they will draw near, and come before the city, and will encamp on the north to Ai: and the valley between them and Ai.
{8:12} And he will take about five thousand men and set them in ambush between the house of God and between Ai, from the sea, to the city.
{8:13} And the people will set all the camp which is from the north to the city, and its lying in wait, from the sea to the city; and Joshua will go in that night into the midst of the valley.
{8:14} And it will be when the king of Ai saw, and they will hasten and will rise early, and the men of the city will come forth to the meeting of Israel, to war, he, and all his people, at the appointment before the desert: and he knew not that an ambush to him from behind the city.
{8:15} And Joshua and all Israel will be smitten before them, and will flee the way of the desert.
{8:16} And all the people which are in the city will be called together to pursue after them, and they will pursue after Joshua, and be drawn away from the city.
{8:17} And a man was not left in Ai and the house of God, who will not go forth after Israel: and they will leave the city opened and will pursue after Israel.
{8:18} And Jehovah will say to Joshua, Stretch with the javelin which is in thine hand, to Ai; for into thine hand will I give it. And Joshua will stretch forth with the javelin which in his hand, to the city.
{8:19} And the ambush rose quickly from its place, and they will run when he stretched out his hand: and they will come into the city and take it, and they will hasten and set the city on fire.
{8:20} And the men of Ai will turn back behind them and will see, and behold, the smoke of the city went up to the heavens, and there was not with them hands to flee hither and thither: and the people having fled, turned back to the pursuers.
{8:21} And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush took the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, and they will turn back and smite the men of Ai.
{8:22} And these will go forth from the city to their meeting; and they will be to Israel in the midst of these from hence, and these from thence: and they will smite them till none were left to them fleeing and escaping.
{8:23} And the king of Ai they seized, living, and they will bring him to Joshua.
{8:24} And it will be when Israel finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the desert, where they pursued them in it, and all of them will fall before the mouth of the sword till they were finished, and all Israel will turn back to Ai and will smite it by the mouth of the sword.
{8:25} And it will be, all falling in that day from men, even to women, twelve thousand; all the men of Ai.
{8:26} And Joshua turned not back his hand which he stretched out with the spear till he exterminated all the inhabitants of Ai.
{8:27} Only the cattle and spoil of that city Israel plundered to  themselves, according to the word of Jehovah which he commanded Joshua.
{8:28} And Joshua will burn Ai and set it a heap forever, a waste even to this day.
{8:29} And the king of Ai he hung upon the tree till the time of evening: and when the sun went down Joshua commanded and they will take down his carcass from the tree and cast it at the opening of the gate of the city, and they will set upon it a great heap of stones till this day.
{8:30} Then Joshua will build an altar to Jehovah the God of Israel in mount Ebal.
{8:31} As Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded the sons of Israel, as it was written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of stones complete; which iron was not lifted up upon them: and they will bring up upon it burnt-offerings to Jehovah, and will sacrifice peace.
{8:32} And he will write there upon the stones the second of the law of Moses which he wrote before the sons of Israel.
{8:33} All Israel and his old men and scribes, and his judges stood hence, and thence, to the ark before the priests the Levites, lifting up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, so the stranger as the native; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded to bless the people of Israel in the beginning.
{8:34} And after this he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all the writing in the book of the law.
{8:35} There was not a word from all that Moses commanded which Joshua read not before all the gathering of Israel, and the women and the little ones and the stranger going in the midst of them.
{9:1} And it will be when all the kings hear which are on the other side Jordan, in the mountain and in the plain, and in all the coast of the great sea, and in front of Lebanon, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite;
{9:2} And they will gather together to fight with Joshua and with Israel with one mouth.
{9:3} And the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua did to Jericho and to Ai.
{9:4} And they will do in guile, and will go and will lay snares, and will take sacking worn out, for their asses, and leather sacks of wine worn out, and being rent and bound up;
{9:5} And shoes worn out and mended, upon their feet, and garments worn out upon them; and all the bread of their food dry; it was crumbs.
{9:6} And they will come to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and will say to him and to the men of Israel, From a land far off we came: and now cut out to us a covenant.
{9:7} And the men of Israel will say to the Hivite, Perhaps thou shalt dwell in the midst of me, and I shall not make a covenant to thee.
{9:8} And they will say to Joshua, We thy servants. And Joshua will say to them, Who are ye? and from whence will ye come?
{9:9} And they will say to him, From a land very far off thy servants came, for the name of Jehovah thy God; for we heard his fame and all that he did in Egypt.
{9:10} And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites on the other side of Jordan, to Sihon, king of Heshbon, and to Og, king of Bashan, in Ashtaroth.
{9:11} And our old men and all the inhabitants of our land will say to us, saying, Take in your hand food for the way, and go to meet them, and say to them, We your servants: and now cut out to us a covenant:
{9:12} This the hot bread we took it for food from our houses in the day we came forth to come to you; and now, behold, it dry, and it was crumbs.
{9:13} And these leather sacks of wine which we filled, new, and behold, they were rent; and these our garments and our shoes worn out from the exceeding greatness of the way.
{9:14} And the men will take of their food, and they asked not the mouth of Jehovah.
{9:15} And Joshua will make peace to them, and will cut out to them a covenant to preserve them alive: and the chiefs of the assembly sware to them.
{9:16} And it will be from the end of three days after they cut out a covenant to them, and they will hear that they are near to him, and they dwell in the midst of him.
{9:17} And the sons of Israel will remove and will come to their cities in the third day. And their cities, Gibeon and Chephirah and Barith, and Kirjath-Jearim.
{9:18} And the sons of Israel smote them not, for the chiefs of the assembly sware to them by Jehovah the God of Israel. And all the assembly will murmur against the chiefs.
{9:19} And all the chiefs will say to all the assembly, We sware to them by Jehovah the God of Israel: and now we shall not be able to touch upon them.
{9:20} This we will do to them, and preserve them alive; and anger shall not be upon us for the oath that we sware to them.
{9:21} And the chiefs will say to them, They shall live; and shall be cutting wood and drawing water to all the assembly as the chiefs spake to them.
{9:22} And Joshua will call to them and will speak to them, saying, For what did ye deceive us, saying, We are very far from you? and ye dwell in the midst of us.
{9:23} And now ye are cursed, and there shall not be cut off from you to serve, and hewing wood and drawing water for the house of my God.
{9:24} And they will answer Joshua, and will say, Because being announced, it was announced to thy servants that Jehovah thy God commanded Moses his servant to give to you all the land, and to destroy all inhabiting the land from before you, and we shall be greatly afraid for our souls from your face; and we shall do this word.
{9:25} And now, behold us in thy hand: as is good and as is right in your eyes to do to us, do.
{9:26} And he will do so to them, and he will deliver them from the hand of the sons of Israel, and they slew them not.
{9:27} And Joshua will give them in that day hewing wood and drawing water for the assembly and for the altar of Jehovah till this day, to the place which he shall choose.
{10:1} And it will be lord Zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua took Ai and exterminated it; as he did to Jericho and to her king, so he did to Ai and her king; and that the inhabitants of Gibeon made peace with Israel, and they will be in the midst of them.
{10:2} And they will fear greatly, for a great city was Gibeon, as one of the cities of the kingdom, and that it was great above Ai, and all her men mighty.
{10:3} And lord Zedek, king of Jerusalem, will send to Hoham, king of Hebron, and to Piram, king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia, king of Lachish, and to Debir, king of Eglon, saying,
{10:4} Come up to me and help me, and we will smite Gibeon, because she made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel.
{10:5} And the five kings of the Amorites will be gathered together and will come up: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, they and all their camps, and they will encamp against Gibeon, and they will war against her.
{10:6} And the men of Gibeon will send to Joshua to the camp of Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hands from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites inhabiting the mountain gathered themselves together against us.
{10:7} And Joshua will come up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty of strength.
{10:8} And Jehovah will say to Joshua, Thou shalt not be afraid of them, for into thy hands I gave them; a man of them shall not stand before thee.
{10:9} And Joshua will come to them suddenly, all night he went up from Gilgal.
{10:10} And Jehovah will discomfit them before Israel, and will strike them a great blow in Gibeon, and will pursue them the way of the ascent of the house of Horon, and he will strike them even to Azekah and even to Makkedah.
{10:11} And it will be in their fleeing from before Israel, they in the descent of the house of Horon, and Jehovah cast down upon them great stones from the heavens, even to Azekah; and more will die who died by the stones of hail than whom the sons of Israel slew with the sword.
{10:12} Then will Joshua speak to Jehovah in the day Jehovah will give the Amorite before the sons of Israel, and he will say before the eyes of Israel, Sun in Gibeon, be thou silent, and thou Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.
{10:13} And the sun will be silent, and the moon stood, till the people will be avenged upon its enemies. Is it not written upon the book of the upright? and the sun will stand in the half of the heavens, and it hasted not to go down for a whole day.
{10:14} And there was not as that day, before it and after it, that Jehovah heard to the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel.
{10:15} And Joshua turned back, and all Israel with him, to the camp of Gilgal.
{10:16} And these five kings will flee and will hide in a cave in Makkedah.
{10:17} And it will be announced to Joshua, saying, The five kings were found hid in a cave in Makkedah.
{10:18} And Joshua will say, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men over it to watch them.
{10:19} And ye shall not stand; pursue after your enemies; cut off the rear of them; ye shall not give them to come in to their cities, for Jehovah your God gave them into your hand.
{10:20} And it will be when Joshua finished, and the sons of Israel, smiting them an exceeding great blow till he finished them, and they escaping, escaped from them and they will go to the fortified cities.
{10:21} And all the people will turn back to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: and none sharpened his tongue against a man to the sons of Israel.
{10:22} And Joshua will say, Open the mouth of the cave and bring forth to me these five kings out of the cave.
{10:23} And they will do so, and will bring forth to him these five kings out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
{10:24} And it will be when they brought these kings forth to Joshua, and Joshua will call to every man of Israel, and will say to the leaders of the men of war having gone with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they will come near and put their feet upon their necks.
{10:25} And Joshua will say to them, Ye shall not fear and ye shall not be dismayed; be strong and be active, for thus will Jehovah do to all your enemies whom ye war against them.
{10:26} And Joshua will smite them after this, and will kill them, and hang them upon five trees: and they will be hanging upon the trees till evening.
{10:27} And it will be at the time of the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they will take them down from the trees and cast them into the cave where they were hid there; and they will put great stones upon the mouth of the cave till this self-same day.
{10:28} And Joshua took Makkedah in that day, and he will smite her with the mouth of the sword; and her king he exterminated, them, and every soul which was in her; none was left escaping: and he will do to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho.
{10:29} And Joshua will pass by and all Israel with him from Makkedah to Libnah, and will fight with Libnah.
{10:30} And Jehovah will also give it into the hand of Israel, and her king: and he will smite it with the mouth of the sword and every soul which is in it; none was left in it escaping; and he will do to her king as he did to the king of Jericho.
{10:31} And Joshua will pass over, and all Israel with him, from Libnah to Lachish, and he will encamp against it, and he will fight against it.
{10:32} And Jehovah will give Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he will take it in the second day, and smite it with the mouth of the sword, and every soul which is in it, according to all which he did to Libnah.
{10:33} Then Horam, king of Gezer, came up to help Lachish; and Joshua will smite him and his people till none was left to him escaping.
{10:34} And Joshua will pass over, and all Israel with him, from Lachish to Eglon: and they will encamp against it and they will war against it:
{10:35} And they will take it in that day, and they will smite it with the mouth of the sword, and every soul which is in it in that day he exterminated according to all which he did to Lachish.
{10:36} And Joshua will go up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon to Hebron; and they will war against it:
{10:37} And they will take it and smite it with the mouth of the sword, and its king and all its cities and every soul which is in it; none was left escaping, according to all which he did to Eglon; and he will exterminate it, and every soul which is in it.
{10:38} And Joshua will turn back, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and he will war against it.
{10:39} And he will take it and its king, and all its cities, and they will smite them with the mouth of the sword, and exterminate every soul which is in it; none was left escaping: as he did to Hebron so he did to Debir and to her king, and as he did to Libnah and her king.
{10:40} And Joshua will smite all the land of the mountain, and the south, and the valley and the ravines, and all their kings: and none was left escaping, and all breathing was exterminated, as Jehovah the God of Israel commanded.
{10:41} And Joshua will smite from Kadesh-Barnea and even to Gaza, and all the land of Goshen and even to Gibeon.
{10:42} And all these kings and their land Joshua took, one time; for Jehovah the God of Israel fought for Israel.
{10:43} And Joshua will turn back and all Israel with him to the camp of Gilgal.
{11:1} And it will be when Jabin, king of Hazor, heard, and he will send to Jobab, king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
{11:2} And to the kings that were from the north upon the mountain, and in the desert south of Cinneroth, and in the valley, and in the height of Dor from the sea,
{11:3} The Canaanite from the sun-rising and from the sea, and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountain, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
{11:4} And they will come forth, they, and their camps with them, many people, as the sand upon the lip of the sea for multitude, and horse and chariot exceeding many.
{11:5} And all these kings will meet by appointment, and they will come and will encamp together at the water of Merom, to war with Israel.
{11:6} And Jehovah will say to Joshua, Thou shalt not be afraid of their face: for to-morrow about this time I gave them all wounded before Israel: thou shalt hamstring their horses and their chariots thou shalt burn in fire.
{11:7} And Joshua will come, and all the people of war with him, upon them by the water of Merom suddenly, and they will fall upon them.
{11:8} And Jehovah will give them into the hand of Israel, and they will smite them, and they will pursue them, even to great Zidon, and even to Misrephoth-Maim, and even to the valley of Mizpeh from the sunrising; and he will smite them till none was left to them escaping.
{11:9} And Joshua will do to them as Jehovah said to him: he hamstrung their horses, and burnt their chariots in fire.
{11:10} And Joshua will turn back in that time and he will take Hazor, and her king he smote with the sword: and Hazor before them it is the head of all these kingdoms.
{11:11} And they will smite every soul which is in it with the mouth of the sword, exterminating: and no breath was left: and he burnt Hazor in fire.
{11:12} And all the cities of these kings and all their kingdoms Joshua took, and he will smite them with the mouth of the sword, exterminating them, as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded.
{11:13} Only all the cities standing upon their heap, Israel burnt them not, except Hazor only Joshua burnt.
{11:14} And all the spoil of these cities and the cattle, the sons of Israel plundered for themselves; only every man they smote with the mouth of the sword, till they destroyed them; not any breath was left.
{11:15} As Jehovah commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did: he turned not aside a word from all which Jehovah commanded Moses.
{11:16} And Joshua will take all this land, the mountain and all the south, and all the land of Goshen, and the plain, and the desert region and the mountain of Israel, and its plain;
{11:17} From the smooth mountain going up to Seir, and even to the lord of Gad in the plains of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and he will smite them and kill them.
{11:18} Many days Joshua made war with all these kings.
{11:19} There was not a city that made peace to the sons of Israel, only the Hivites dwelling in Gibeon; they took all in war.
{11:20} For from Jehovah it was to strengthen their heart to meet Israel in war in order to destroy them; no favor to be to them, but to destroy them as Jehovah commanded Moses.
{11:21} And Joshua will go in that time and will cut off the Anakims from the mountain, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from every mountain of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel, with their cities Joshua exterminated them.
{11:22} An Anakim was not left in the land of the sons of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, they were left.
{11:23} And Joshua will take all the land which Jehovah spake to Moses, and Joshua will give it for an inheritance to Israel according to their portion to their tribes. And the land rested from war.
{12:1} And these the kings of the land which the sons of Israel smote; and they will inherit their land, on the other side Jordan from the rising of the sun, from the torrent Arnon, even to the mountain Hermon, and all the desert from the sunrising:
{12:2} Sihon, king of the Amorites, dwelling in Heshbon, he ruled from Aroer, which is upon the lip of the torrent Arnon, and between the torrent and half Gilead, and even to the torrent Jabbok, the boundary of the sons of Ammon;
{12:3} And the desert even to the sea of Cinneroth from the sunrising, and even to the sea of the desert, the salt sea, from the sunrising, the way of the house of Jeshimoth; and from the south under the ravines of Pisgah:
{12:4} And the bound of Og, king of Bashan, being left of the Rephaims dwelling in Aahtaroth and in Edrei,
{12:5} And he ruled in mount Hermon and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, even to the bound of Geshurite and the Maachathite and half Gilead, the bound of Sihon, king of Heshbon.
{12:6} Moses the servant of Jehovah, and the sons of Israel, smote them: and Moses the servant of Jehovah will give it a possession to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh.
{12:7} And these the kings of the land which Joshua smote, and the sons of Israel, on the other side Jordan to the sea, from lord Gad in the plain of Lebanon, and even to the smooth mountain going up to Seir; and Joshua will give it to the tribes of Israel an inheritance, according to their divisions;
{12:8} In the mountain and in the plain and in the desert, and in the ravines and in the desert, and in the south, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite:
{12:9} The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai which is beside the house of God, one;
{12:10} The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
{12:11} The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
{12:12} The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
{12:13} The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
{12:14} the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
{12:15} The king of Libnah, one: the king of Adallam, one;
{12:16} The king of Makkedah, one; the king of the house of God, one;
{12:17} The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
{12:18} The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;
{12:19} The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
{12:20} The king of Shimron-Meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
{12:21} The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
{12:22} The king of Kadesh, one; the king of Jokneam to Carmel, one;
{12:23} The king of Dor of the heights of Dor, one; the king of the nations to Gilgal, one;
{12:24} The king of Tirzah, one; all the kings, thirty and one.
{13:1} And Joshua an old man going in days; and Jehovah will say to him, Thou wert old, going in days, and the land being left very great to possess it.
{13:2} This the land being left: all the circuit of Philisteim, and all Geshuri,
{13:3} From Sihor, which is upon the face of Egypt, even to the bound of Ekron to the north, it will be reckoned to the Canaanite; five lords of Philisteim; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites, and the Avites:
{13:4} From the south all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah which is to the Sidonians, even to Aphek, even to the bound of the Amorite:
{13:5} And the land of the Giblites and all Lebanon from the sunrising from lord Gad under mount Hermon, even to the entrance of Hamath.
{13:6} All inhabiting the mountains from Lebanon to Misrephoth-Maim, all the Sidonians, I will drive them out from before the sons of Israel: only separate it to Israel in inheritance as I commanded thee.
{13:7} And now divide this land in inheritance to the nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh,
{13:8} With him the Reubenites and the Gadites took their inheritance which Moses gave to them on the other side of Jordan from the sunrising, as Moses the servant of Jehovah gave to them:
{13:9} From Aroer that is upon the lip of the torrent Arnon, and the city which is in the midst of the torrent, and all the plain of Medeba, even to Dibon;
{13:10} And all the cities of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, even to the bound of the sons of Ammon;
{13:11} And Gilead and the bound of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan even to Salcah;
{13:12} All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, he was left of the remnant of the Rephaims. And Moses smote them and drove them out.
{13:13} And the sons of Israel drove not out the Geshurites and the Maachathites: and the Geshurite and the Maachathite dwelt in the midst of Israel even to this day.
{13:14} Only to the tribe of Levi he gave not inheritance, the sacrifices of Jehovah the God of Israel it is his inheritance, as he spake to him.
{13:15} And Moses will give to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families.
{13:16} And the boundary to them will be from Aroer which is upon the lip of the torrent Arnon, and the city which is in the midst of the torrent, and all the plain upon Medeba:
{13:17} Heshbon and all her cities which are in the plain; Dibon and Bamoth-Baal, and the house of the lord of the fortress,
{13:18} And Jahaza and Kedemoth and Mephaath,
{13:19} And Kirjathaim and Libnah, and Zarath-Shahar in the mountain of the valley,
{13:20} And the house of Peor, and the ravines of Pisgah, and the house of Jeshimoth,
{13:21} And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote him with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur and Reba, princes of Sihon, dwelling in the land.
{13:22} And Balaam son of Beor, divining, the sons of Israel slew with the sword to those being wounded by them.
{13:23} And the bound of the sons of Reuben shall be Jordan and the boundary. This the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, their cities and their enclosures.
{13:24} And Moses will give to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad according to their families.
{13:25} And their bound shall be to them, Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, even to Aroer, which is upon the face of Rabbah;
{13:26} And from Heshbon even to Ramath-Mizpeh, and Betonim; and from the two camps even to the bound to Debir;
{13:27} And in the valley The House of Height and the House of Sweet Water, and Succoth and Zephon, the remnant of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and the boundary, even to the end of the sea of Cinneroth beyond Jordan from the sunrising.
{13:28} This the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families their cities and their enclosures.
{13:29} And Moses will give to the half of the tribe of Manasseh; and it shall be to half of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh, according to their families.
{13:30} And their bound shall be from the two camps, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair which are in Bashan, sixty cities.
{13:31} And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og, in Bashan, to the sons of Machir, son of Manasseh, to half the sons of Machir according to their families.
{13:32} These which Moses caused to inherit in the sterile regions of Moab from beyond Jordan of Jericho from the sunrising.
{13:33} And to the tribe of Levi Moses gave not an inheritance: Jehovah the God of Israel, he their inheritance as he spake to them.
{14:1} And these what the sons of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan which Eleazar the priest caused them to inherit, and Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes to the sons of Israel.
{14:2} By lot their inheritance as Jehovah commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and the half tribe.
{14:3} For Moses gave the inheritance of the two tribes and the half tribe from beyond Jordan: and to the Levites he gave not an inheritance in the midst of them.
{14:4} For the sons of Joseph shall be two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave not a portion to the Levites in the land except cities to dwell in and their pastures for their cattle, and for their possession.
{14:5} As Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the sons of Israel, and they divided the land.
{14:6} And the sons of Judah will come near to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb, son of Jephunneh will say to him, Thou knewest the word which Jehovah spake to Moses the man of God on account of me and on account of thee in Kadesh-Barnea.
{14:7} The son of forty years was I in Moses the servant of Jehovah sending me from Kadesh-Barnea to spy the land; and I will turn back word to him as with my heart.
{14:8} And my brethren who went up with me caused the heart of the people to melt: and I filled up after Jehovah my God.
{14:9} And Moses will sware in that day, saying, Shall not the land which thy foot trod upon it be to thee for inheritance, and to thy sons even to forever? for thou didst fill up after Jehovah my God.
{14:10} And now, behold, Jehovah preserved me alive as he spake this forty and five years, from the time Jehovah spake this word to Moses, when Israel went in the desert: and now, behold me this day the son of five and eighty years.
{14:11} Yet I this day strong as in the day Moses sent me; as my strength then and so my strength now, for war, to go out and to come in.
{14:12} And now thou shalt give to me this mountain which Jehovah spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day that the Anakims were there, and the cities great being fortified: if Jehovah be with me, and I drove them out, as Jehovah spake.
{14:13} And Joshua will bless him and will give Hebron to Caleb, son of Jephunneh, for inheritance.
{14:14} For this Hebron was to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizite, for inheritance even to this day, because that he filled up after Jehovah the God of Israel.
{14:15} And the name of Hebron before, the city of Arba; he the great man among the Anakims And the land rested from war.
{15:1} And the lot shall be to the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families, to the bound of Edom, the desert of Zin south from the south extremity.
{15:2} And the south bound shall be to them from the extremity of the salt sea from the tongue turning south.
{15:3} And it went out to the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and it passed over Zin and went up from the south to Kadesh-Barnea, and passed by Hezron and went up to Adar and encompassed Karkaa.
{15:4} And it passed through Azmon, and it went out to the torrent of Egypt; and the going forth of the bound was to the sea: this shall be to you the south bound.

{22:3} Ye left not your brethren this many days till this day, and ye watched the watches of the command of Jehovah your God.
{22:4} And now Jehovah your God caused your brethren to rest as he spake to them: and now turn ye and go for yourselves to your tents to the land of your possession which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave to you beyond Jordan.
{22:5} Only watch greatly to do the command and the law which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, to love Jehovah your God and to go in all his ways, and to watch his commands, and to cleave to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.

{22:17} Was the iniquity of Peor little for us, which we were not cleansed from it till this day, and there will be a smiting in the assembly of Jehovah?

{22:22} The God of gods, Jehovah, the God of gods, Jehovah he will know, and Israel he will know; if in rebellion and if in transgression against Jehovah, thou shalt not save us this day;
{22:23} To build to us an altar to turn back from after Jehovah, and if to bring up upon it a burnt-offering and a gift, and if to do upon it sacrifices of peace Jehovah he will search;
{22:24} And if we did not do this from fear of the word, saying, To-morrow your sons will say to our sons, saying, What to you and to Jehovah the God of Israel.

{22:27} But this a witness between us and between you, and between our generations after us, to serve the service of Jehovah before him with our burnt-offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace-offerings; and your sons shall not say, To-morrow, to our sons, not to you, a part in Jehovah.
{22:28} And we shall say, and it was that they shall say to us and to our generations to-morrow, and we said, See the model of the altar of Jehovah which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering and not for sacrifice; but this a witness between us and between you.

{22:32} And Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, will turn back, and the chiefs, from the sons of Reuben and from the sons of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and will turn back to them the word.
{22:33} And the word will be good in the eves of the sons of Israel; and the sons of Israel will bless God, and they said not to go up against them to war to destroy the land which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad dwelt in it.
{22:34} And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad will call to the altar: for it is a witness between us that Jehovah is their God.
{23:1} And it will be from many days after that Jehovah caused Israel to rest from all their enemies round about, Joshua was old, gone in days.
{23:2} And Joshua will call to all Israel, to his old men and to his heads and to his judges and to his scribes, and he will say to them, I have become old; I came into days:
{23:3} And ye saw all which Jehovah your God did to all these nations from your face; for Jehovah your God fought for you.
{23:4} See, I cast to you in lot these nations having been left in inheritance to your tribes from Jordan, and all the nations which I cut off, and the great, sea, from the going down of the sun.
{23:5} And Jehovah your God he shall thrust them away from your face and drive them out from before you; and ye possessed their land, as Jehovah your God spake to you.
{23:6} And be strong greatly to watch and to do all written in the book of the law of Moses, so as not to turn away from it to the right or to the left;
{23:7} So as not to come among these nations, these being left with you; and ye shall not make mention of the name of their gods, and ye shall not swear, and ye shall not serve them, and ye shall not worship to them:
{23:8} But ye shall cleave to Jehovah your God, as ye did even to this day.
{23:9} And Jehovah will drive out from your face great nations and strong: and you, a man stood not before you even to this day.
{23:10} One man from you shall pursue a thousand: for Jehovah your God he fought for you as he spake to you.
{23:11} And watch greatly for your souls, to love Jehovah your God.
{23:12} For if turning back, ye shall turn back and cleave to the remainder of these nations, these being left with you, and marry with them, and go in to them, and they in to you,
{23:13} Knowing, ye shall know that Jehovah your God will not add to drive out these nations from before you: and they, were to you for a snare and for a noose, and for a scourge in your sides, and for thorns in your eyes, till your destruction from this good land which Jehovah your God gave to you.
{23:14} And behold, I go this day in the way of all the earth; and ye knew in all your heart and in all your soul that not one word fell from all the good words which Jehovah your God spake concerning you; all came to you; not one word fell from it.
{23:15} And it was as every good word came upon you which Jehovah your God spake to you, so Jehovah will bring upon you every evil word till his destroying you from off this good land which Jehovah your God gave to you.
{23:16} In your passing by the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he commanded you, and ye went and served other gods and worshipped to them; and the anger of Jehovah kindled against you, and ye perished quickly from off the good land which he gave to you.
{24:1} And Joshua will gather together all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and he will call for the old men of Israel, and for the heads, and for the judges, and for the scribes; and they will stand before God.
{24:2} And Joshua will say to all the people, So said Jehovah the God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt beyond the river from everlasting time, Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor and they will serve other gods.
{24:3} And I will take your father Abraham from beyond the river, and I will lead him into all the land of Canaan, and I will multiply his seed and I will give to him Isaak.
{24:4} And I will give to Isaak, Jacob and Esau: and I will give to Esau mount Seir, to possess it; and Jacob and his sons will go down to Egypt.
{24:5} And I will send Moses and Aaron, and I will strike Egypt as I did in its midst: and afterwards I will bring you out.
{24:6} And I will bring out your fathers from Egypt; and ye shall come to the sea: and the Egyptians will pursue after your fathers with chariot and horsemen to the sea of sedge.
{24:7} And they will cry to Jehovah, and he will put darkness between you and between Egypt, and he will bring the sea upon him, and will cover him; and your eyes will see what I did in Egypt; and ye shall dwell in the desert many days.
{24:8} And I will bring you to the land of the Amorite dwelling beyond Jordan, and they will fight with you and I will give them into your hand, and ye shall inherit their land; and I will destroy them from before your face.
{24:9} And Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, will rise up and will fight against Israel, and he will send and call for Balaam son of Beor, to curse you:
{24:10} And I was not disposed to hear to Balaam and blessing, he will bless you; and I will deliver you from his hand.
{24:11} And ye shall pass through Jordan, and ye shall come to Jericho; and the lords of Jericho will fight against you, the Amorite and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I will give them into your hand.
{24:12} And I will send before you the hornet, and it shall drive them out from your face, the two kings of the Amorites: not with thy sword and not with thy bow.
{24:13} And I will give to you the land which ye labored not in it, and cities which ye built not, and ye shall dwell in them; the vineyards and the olives which ye planted not, ye ate.
{24:14} And, now fear ye Jehovah and serve him in uprightness and in truth; and remove the gods which your fathers served beyond the river and in Egypt; and serve ye Jehovah.
{24:15} And if evil in your eyes to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves this day whom ye will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served which are beyond the river, and whether the gods of the Amorite which ye dwelt in their land: and I and my house, we will serve Jehovah.
{24:16} An the people will answer and say, Woe to us forsaking Jehovah to serve other gods;
{24:17} For Jehovah our God, he bringing us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants, and who did before our eyes these great signs; and he will watch us in all the way which we went in it, and among all the peoples which we passed through in the midst of them:
{24:18} And Jehovah will drive out all the peoples, and the Amorite dwelling in the land, from our face: also we will serve Jehovah, for he is our God.
{24:19} And Joshua will say to the people, Ye will not be able to serve Jehovah, for a holy God is he: a jealous God is he; he will not take away your transgressions and your sins.
{24:20} If ye shall forsake Jehovah and serve strange gods, and he turned back and did evil to you, and finished you after that he did good to you.
{24:21} And the people will say to Joshua, Nay; but Jehovah we will serve.
{24:22} And Joshua will say to the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves, for ye chose to yourselves Jehovah to serve him. And they will say, Witnesses.
{24:23} And now remove the strange gods which are in the midst of you, and incline your heart to Jehovah the God of Israel.
{24:24} And the people will say to Joshua, Jehovah our God we will serve, and to his voice will we hear.
{24:25} And Joshua will cut out a covenant to the people in that day and will set to him a law and a judgment in Shechem.
{24:26} And Joshua will write these words in the book of the law of God, and he will take a great stone and will set it up there under the oak which is in the holy place of Jehovah.
{24:27} And Joshua will say to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be to us for a testimony, for it heard all the sayings of Jehovah which he spake with us: and it was to you for a testimony lest ye shall lie to your God.
{24:28} And Joshua will send away the people each to his inheritance.
{24:29} And it will be after these words, and Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, will die, the son of a hundred and ten years.
{24:30} And they will bury him in the bound of his inheritance in Timnath-Serah, which is in mount Ephraim from the north, to the mount of Gaash.
{24:31} And Israel will serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the old men who prolonged the days after Joshua, and who knew all the works of Jehovah which he did to Israel.
{24:32} And the bones of Joseph which the sons of Israel brought up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in a portion of the field which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem, for a hundred weight; and they will be to the sons of Joseph for an inheritance.
{24:33} And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they will bury him in Gibeah of Phinehas his son, which he gave to him in mount Ephraim.
