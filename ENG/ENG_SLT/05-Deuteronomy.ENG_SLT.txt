{1:1} These the words which Moses spake to all Israel on the other side Jordan in the desert, in the sterile region over against the sedge between Paran and between Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab.
{1:2} Eleven days from Horeb the way of mount Seir to Kadesh-Barnea.
{1:3} And it shall be in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, in one to the Month, Moses spake to the sons of Israel according to all which Jehovah commanded him to them.
{1:4} After his smiting Sihon, king of the Amorites, who will dwell in Heshbon, and Og, king of Bashan, who will dwell in Ashtaroth in Edrei:
{1:5} In the other side Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses was first to declare this law, saying,
{1:6} Jehovah our God spake to us in Horeb, saying, It was enough to you to dwell in this mount:
{1:7} Turn ye and remove for yourselves, and go to the mountain of the Amorite, and to all his neighbors in the sterile region, in the mountain, and in the low country, and in the south and in the coast of the sea, the land of the Canaanites and of Lebanon to the great river, the river Phrath.
{1:8} See, I gave the land before you: go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware to your fathers, to Abraham to Isaak and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.
{1:9} And I spake to you at that time, saying, I shall not be able alone to bear you:
{1:10} Jehovah your God multiplied you, and behold, you this day as the stars of the heavens for multitude.
{1:11} Jehovah the God of your fathers will add to you as ye a thousand times, and he will bless you as he spake to you.
{1:12} How shall I bear alone your burden and your lifting up and your strife.
{1:13} Give to yourselves men wise and known to your tribes, and I will set them for your heads.
{1:14} And ye will answer me and say, Good the word which thou spakest to do.
{1:15} And I will take the heads of your tribes, men wise and known, and I will give them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains and hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and scribes for your tribes.
{1:16} And I shall command your judges in that time, saying, Hear between your brethren, and judge justice between a man and between his brother and between his stranger.
{1:17} Ye shall not look upon faces in judgment; as the small so the great shall ye hear; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is to God; and the word which shall be hard for you, ye shall bring to me and I heard it.
{1:18} And I will command you in that time all the words which ye shall do.
{1:19} And we shall remove from Horeb and we shall go all that great and fearful desert which ye saw, the way of the mountain of the Amorite, as Jehovah our God commanded us; and we shall come to Kadesh-Barnea.
{1:20} And I said to you, Ye came to the mountain of the Amorite which Jehovah our God gave to us.
{1:21} See, Jehovah thy God gave the land before thee: go up, possess, as Jehovah the God of thy fathers spake to thee; thou shalt not fear and thou shalt not be pressed down.
{1:22} And ye shall come near to me all of you, and ye will say, We will send men before us, and they shall search out for us the land, and shall turn us back word the way which we shall go up into it, and the cities which we shall come into them.
{1:23} And the word will be good in mine eyes: and I will take from you twelve men, one man to a tribe.
{1:24} And they will turn and go up to the mountain, and they will come to the valley of Eshcol, and will search it out.
{1:25} And they will take in their hand from the fruit of the land, and they will come down to us and will turn us back word, and will say, A good land which Jehovah our God gave to us.
{1:26} And ye were not willing to go up, and ye will rebel against the mouth of Jehovah your God,
{1:27} And ye will murmur in your tents, and say, In Jehovah's hating us he brought us out of the land of Egypt to give us into the hand of the Amorite to destroy us.
{1:28} Whither are we going up? our brethren melted our heart, saying, A people great and high above us; cities great and fortified to the heavens; and also, the sons of the Anakims, we saw there.
{1:29} And I said to you, Ye shall not be terrified, and ye shall not be afraid of them.
{1:30} Jehovah your God went before you; he will fight for you according to all that he did to you in Egypt before your eyes.
{1:31} And in the desert where thou sawest that Jehovah thy God lifted thee up, as a man will lift up his son, in all the way that ye went till your coming to this place.
{1:32} And in this word ye are not believing in Jehovah your God.
{1:33} He going in the way before you to search out for you a place for you to encamp, in fire by night, to cause you to see in what way ye shall go in it, and in a cloud by day.
{1:34} And Jehovah will hear the voice of your words, and he will be angry, and he will swear, saying,
{1:35} If a man among these men of this evil generation shall see the good land which I sware to give to your fathers,
{1:36} Except Caleb, son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him I will give the land which he trod upon it, and to his sons, because that he filled up after Jehovah.
{1:37} Also with me was Jehovah angry on account of you, saying, Also thou shalt not come in there.
{1:38} Joshua son of Nun, standing before thee, he shall come in there: strengthen him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
{1:39} And your little ones which ye said shall be for a spoil, and your sons which knew not that day good and evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
{1:40} And you, turn for yourselves and remove to the desert the way of the sea of sedge.
{1:41} And ye will answer and say to me, We sinned against Jehovah, we will go up and fight according to all that Jehovah our God commanded us. And ye will gird on each the weapon of his fighting, and ye will act lightly to go up to the mountain.
{1:42} And Jehovah will say to me, Say to them, Ye shall not go up, and ye shall not fight; for I am not in the midst of you and ye shall not be smitten before your enemies.
{1:43} And I shall speak to you, and ye heard not; and ye will rebel against the mouth of Jehovah, and ye will act proudly, and will go up to the mountain.
{1:44} And the Amorite dwelling in that mountain will come forth to your meeting, and will pursue you as bees will do, and they will beat you in Seir to Hormah.
{1:45} And ye will turn back and will weep before Jehovah; and Jehovah heard not to your voice and gave not ear to you.
{1:46} And ye shall dwell in Kadesh many days according to the days that ye dwelt.
{2:1} And turning and removing to the desert the way of the sea of sedge, as Jehovah spake to me: and encompassing mount Seir many days.
{2:2} And Jehovah will speak to me, saying,
{2:3} It was enough to you to encompass this mount; turn for yourselves to the north,
{2:4} And command the people, saying, Ye are passing over through the bound of your brethren the sons of Esau, dwelling in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: and ye shall watch greatly.
{2:5} Ye shall not contend with them, for I will not give to you from their land even to the treading of the sole of the foot, for I gave mount Seir to Esau for a possession.
{2:6} Ye shall buy food from them for silver, and ye ate: and also shall ye buy water from them for silver, and ye drank.
{2:7} For Jehovah thy God blessed thee in every work of thy hand: he knew thy going in this great desert: this forty years Jehovah thy God with thee; thou didst not lack a word.
{2:8} And we shall pass by our brethren the sons of Esau, dwelling in Seir, from the way of the sterile region from Elath, and from Ezion-Gaber, we shall turn and shall pass over the way of the desert of Moab.
{2:9} And Jehovah will say to me, Thou shalt not press Moab, and thou shalt not contend with them in war; for I shall not give to thee his land a possession, for to the sons of Lot I gave Ar a possession.
{2:10} (The Emims dwelt in it before them, a people great and many and high as the Anakims;
{2:11} And they will be reckoned Rephaims also, as the Anakims; and the Moabites will call them Emims.
{2:12} And the Horims dwelt in Seir before them, and the sons of Esau will inherit them, and they will destroy them from before them, and they will dwell instead of them; as Israel did to the land of his possession which Jehovah gave to them.)
{2:13} Now rise up and pass over for yourselves the valley Zered; and we shall pass through the torrent Zered.
{2:14} And the days which we came from Kadesh-Barnea till we passed over the valley Zered, thirty and eight years; till all the generation of men of war was finished from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah sware to them.
{2:15} For also the hand of Jehovah was against them to finish them from the midst of the camp, till their finishing.
{2:16} And it will be as when all the men of war were finished to die from the midst of the people,
{2:17} And Jehovah will speak to me, saying,
{2:18} Pass thou over this day Ar, the boundary of Moab:
{2:19} And thou camest near over against the sons of Ammon, thou shalt not press them, and thou shalt not contend with them: for I will not give from the land of the sons of Ammon to thee a possession; for to the sons of Lot I gave it a possession.
{2:20} It also shall be reckoned the land of the Rephaims; the Rephaims dwelt in it before them, and the Ammonites called them Zamzummims;
{2:21} A people great and many, and high as the Anakims; and Jehovah will destroy them from before their face; and they will inherit them and will dwell instead of them:
{2:22} As he did to the sons of Esau dwelling in Seir when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they will inherit them and will dwell instead of them, even to this day:
{2:23} And the Avims dwelling in the enclosures, even to Azzah, the Caphtorims, coming forth from Caphtor, destroyed them, and they dwelt instead of them.
{2:24} Rise ye up, remove and pass through the torrent Arnon: see, I gave into thy hand Sihon, king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land: begin and possess and thou shalt contend with him in war.
{2:25} This day I will begin to give thy fear and thy terror upon the face of the peoples under all the heavens who shall hear thy report; and they trembled and were concerned from thy face.
{2:26} And I will send messengers out of the desert of Kedemoth to Sihon, king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,
{2:27} I will pass over in thy land; in the way, in the way I will go, I will not turn aside to the right or to the left.
{2:28} Thou shalt sell me food for silver, and I ate; and thou shalt give to me water for silver, and I drank: only I will pass through on my feet;
{2:29} (As the sons of Esau did to me dwelling in Seir, and the Moabites dwelling in Ar,) till when I shall pass over Jordan to the land which Jehovah our God gave to us.
{2:30} And Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing for us to pass by him, for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart strong in order to give him into thy hand as this day.
{2:31} And Jehovah will say to me, See, I began to give before thee Sihon and his land: begin and possess to inherit his land.
{2:32} And Sihon came forth to our meeting, he and all his people to war at Jahaz.
{2:33} Jehovah our God will give him before us; and he smote him and his sons and all his people.
{2:34} And we shall take all his cities in that time, and we shall exterminate every city of men and women and the little ones; we left none to escape.
{2:35} Only the cattle we plundered for ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.
{2:36} From Aroer which is upon the lip of the torrent Arnon, and the city which is by the torrent, and even to Gilead, not a city which was high above us: Jehovah our God gave all before us.
{2:37} Only to the land of the sons of Ammon thou camest not near, all the land of the torrent Jabbok and the cities of the mountain: all which Jehovah our God commanded us.
{3:1} And we shall turn and go up the way of Bashan: and Og, king of Bashan, will come forth to our meeting, he and all his people to war at Edrei.
{3:2} And Jehovah will say to me, Thou shalt not fear him, for into thy hand I gave him and all his people, and his land; and do to him as thou didst to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who will dwell in Hebron.
{3:3} And Jehovah our God will give into our hand also Og, king of Bashan, and all his people: and we shall smite him till none remained to him escaping.
{3:4} And we shall take all his cities in that time, and there was not a city which we took not from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, from the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
{3:5} All these cities fortified with high walls, doors and bars; besides of cities of the open country exceedingly many.
{3:6} And we shall exterminate them as we did to Sihon, king of Heshbon, exterminating men, women, and little ones.
{3:7} And all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we plundered for ourselves.
{3:8} And we shall take in that time the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites, which is on the other side Jordan from the torrent Arnon, even to mount Hermon.
{3:9} (The Sidonians will call to Hermon, Sirion; and the Amorites will call to it, Shenk.)
{3:10} All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, even to Salchah and Edrei, cities from the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
{3:11} For only Og, king of Bashan, remained from the remnant of the Rephaims; behold, his bed, a bed of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the sons of Ammon? nine cubits its length and four cubits its breadth, according to the cubit of a man.
{3:12} And this land we possessed in that time from Aroer which is by the torrent Arnon, and half the mount of Gilead and its cities I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gates.
{3:13} And the remnant of Gilead and all Bashan from the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob and all Bashan, it will be called the land of Rephaims.
{3:14} Jair, son of Manasseh, took all the region of Argob, even to the boundary of Geshuri and Maachathi; and he call them according to his name, Bashan-Havath-Jair, even to this day.
{3:15} And to Machir I gave Gilead.
{3:16} And to the Reubemtes and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the torrent Anion, the midst of the torrent and the boundary and even to the emptying of the torrent, the boundary of the sons of Ammon.
{3:17} And the sterile region, and Jordan, and the boundary from Chinnereth, and even to the sea of the desert, the salt sea under the ravines of Pisgah from the sunrising.
{3:18} And I shall command you in that time, saying, Jehovah your God gave to you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over armed before your brethren, the sons of Israel, all sons of strength.
{3:19} Only your wives and your little ones and your cattle (I knew that much cattle to you) they shall dwell in your cities which I gave to you,
{3:20} Till when Jehovah shall cause your brethren to rest as you, and they also shall possess the land which Jehovah, your God, gave to them on the other side of Jordan: and ye turned back each to his possession which I gave to you.
{3:21} And I commanded Joshua in that time, saying, Thine eyes saw all that Jehovah, your God, did to these two kings: so will Jehovah do to all the kingdoms which ye pass through there.
{3:22} Ye shall not be afraid of them, for Jehovah, your God, he shall fight for you.
{3:23} And I shall entreat Jehovah in that time, saying,
{3:24} O Lord Jehovah, thou didst begin to cause thy servant to see thy greatness and thy strong hand: for what God in the heavens and in the earth will do according to thy works and according to thy strength?
{3:25} Shall I now pass over and see the good land which is beyond Jordan, this good mountain, and Lebanon?
{3:26} And Jehovah will pass by me on account of you, and he heard not to me: and Jehovah said to me, It was enough to thee; thou shalt not add to speak more to me concerning this word.
{3:27} Go up to the head of Pisgah and lift up thine eyes to the sea, and to the north, and to the south, and to the sunrising, and see with thine eyes; for thou shalt not pass over this Jordan.
{3:28} And command Joshua and strengthen him, and make him firm, for he shall pass through before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.
{3:29} And we shall dwell in the valley over against the House of Opening.
{4:1} And now Israel, hear to the laws and to the judgments which I am teaching you to do, so that ye shall live and go in and possess the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers gave to you.
{4:2} Ye shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, and ye shall not take away from it, to watch the commands of Jehovah your God which I am commanding you.
{4:3} Your eyes saw what Jehovah did upon Baal-Peor: for every man who went after Baal-Peor, Jehovah thy God destroyed him from the midst of you.
{4:4} And ye cleaving to Jehovah your God, are living all of you this day.
{4:5} See, I taught you laws and judgments as Jehovah my God commanded me, to do thus in the midst of the land where ye are going there to possess it.
{4:6} And watch and do: for it is your wisdom and your understanding before the eyes of the peoples who shall hear all these laws, and say, Only this great nation a wise and understanding people.
{4:7} For what great nation to whom God being near to it as Jehovah our God in all our calling to him?
{4:8} And what great nation to whom laws and judgments just, as all the instructions which I give before you this day?
{4:9} Only watch to thyself and watch thy soul greatly, lest thou shalt forget the words which thine eyes saw, and lest they shall remove from thy heart all the days of thy life: and make them known to thy sons and to the sons of thy sons.
{4:10} The day thou stoodest before Jehovah thy God in Horeb, in Jehovah saying to me, Gather to me the people and I will cause them to hear my word, that they shall be taught to fear me all the days which they live upon the land; and they shall teach their sons.
{4:11} And ye shall come near and shall stand under the mountain; and the mountain burnt with fire even to the heart of the heavens, darkness, cloud, and gloom.
{4:12} And Jehovah will speak to you from the midst of the fire, ye hearing a voice of words, and ye seeing not an appearance, except a voice.
{4:13} And he will announce to you his covenant which he commanded you to do, the ten words; and he will write them upon two tables of stones.
{4:14} And Jehovah commanded me in that time to teach you laws and judgments for you to do them in the land which ye are passing over there to possess it.
{4:15} And watch ye greatly to your souls, for ye saw not any appearance in the day Jehovah spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:
{4:16} Lest ye shall be corrupted and make to you a carved thing, the appearance of any likeness, the model of male or female,
{4:17} The model of any cattle that is upon the earth, the model of any winged bird that shall fly in the heavens,
{4:18} The model of any thing creeping upon the earth, the model of any fish that is in the waters from under the earth:
{4:19} And lest thou shalt lift up thine eyes to the heavens, and seeing the sun and the moon and the stars, all the army of the heavens, and thou wert driven and didst worship to them, and didst serve them, which Jehovah thy God divided them out to all the peoples under all the heavens.
{4:20} And Jehovah took you and brought you forth out of the furnace of iron, out of Egypt, to be to him for a people of inheritance as this day.
{4:21} And Jehovah will be angry with me on account of your words, and he will swear for me not to pass through Jordan, and not to go in to the good land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance:
{4:22} For I die in this land, not to pass over Jordan: and ye are passing over and shall possess this good land.
{4:23} Watch for yourselves lest ye shall forget the covenant of Jehovah your God which he cut out with you, and ye make to you any carved thing, the appearance of any thing which Jehovah thy God commanded thee.
{4:24} For Jehovah thy God he is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
{4:25} When thou shalt beget sons, and sons' sons, and ye rested in the land and were corrupted, and made a carved thing, the appearance of any thing, and ye did evil in the eyes of Jehovah thy God to irritate him.
{4:26} I took the heavens and the earth to witness against you this day, that perishing, ye shall perish to-morrow from the land which ye are passing over Jordan there to possess it: ye shall not prolong the days upon it, but being destroyed, ye shall be destroyed.
{4:27} And Jehovah scattered you among the peoples, and ye remained men of number among the nations where Jehovah will lead you there.
{4:28} And ye served there gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which shall not see, and shall not hear, and shall not eat, and shall not breathe.
{4:29} And thou sought from thence Jehovah thy God, and thou didst find, for ye shall seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
{4:30} In straitness to thee, and all these words found thee in the last of the days, and thou didst turn to Jehovah thy God and heardest to his voice;
{4:31} For Jehovah thy God a merciful God; he will not desert thee, and he will not destroy thee, and he will not forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware to them.
{4:32} For ask now to the former days which were before thee from the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the end of the heavens to the end of the heavens, Has there been as this great word, or was heard like it?
{4:33} Did people hear the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire as thou didst hear, and shall live?
{4:34} Or did God try to go and take to him a nation from the midst of a nation by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a strong hand and by an extended arm, and by great fears, according to all that Jehovah your God did to you in Egypt before your eyes?
{4:35} Thou sawest to know that Jehovah he is God: no more beside him.
{4:36} Out of the heavens he caused thee to hear his voice to instruct thee: and upon earth he caused thee to see his great fire, and thou heardest his words from the midst of the fire.
{4:37} And because that he loved thy fathers he will choose in his seed after him, and he will bring thee out before him with his great strength from Egypt.
{4:38} To drive out nations great and strong above thee, from thy face, to bring thee in to give to thee their land an inheritance as this day.
{4:39} And know thou this day, and turn back to thy heart, that Jehovah he is God in the heavens from above and upon the earth underneath: and none yet.
{4:40} And watch thou his laws and his commands which I am commanding thee this day, that it shall be good to thee and to thy sons after thee, and that thou shalt prolong the days upon the land that Jehovah thy God gave to thee, all the days.
{4:41} Then Moses will separate three cities in the other side of Jordan from the rising of the sun;
{4:42} For the slayer to flee there when he shall slay his friend without knowledge; and he hated him not yesterday the third day; and he fled to one of these cities and he lived:
{4:43} Bezer in the desert, in the land of the plain to the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead to the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan, to the Manassites.
{4:44} And this the instruction which Moses set before the sons of Israel.
{4:45} These the testimonies and the laws and the judgments which Moses spake to the sons of Israel in their going forth out of Egypt,
{4:46} In the other side of Jordan, in the valley over against the House of Peor, in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who will dwell in Heshbon, whom Moses smote, and the sons of Israel, in their going out of Egypt.
{4:47} And they shall possess their land and the land of Og, king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, which in the other side of Jordan from the rising of the sun;
{4:48} From Aroer, which is upon the lip of the torrent Arnon, and even to mount Sion (it is Hermon.)
{4:49} And all the desert the other side of Jordan, from the sun-rising and even to the sea, the desert under the springs of Pisgah.
{5:1} And Moses will call to all Israel, and say, Hear, thou Israel, the laws and the judgments which I speak in your ears this day, and learn them, and watch to do them.
{5:2} Jehovah our God cut out with us a covenant in Horeb.
{5:3} Jehovah cut not out this covenant with our fathers, but with us, we, these here this day, all we living.
{5:4} Face to face Jehovah spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire.
{5:5} (I stood between Jehovah and between you in that time to announce to you the word of Jehovah: for ye were afraid on account of the fire and ye went not up into the mount,) saying,
{5:6} I Jehovah thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt from the house of servants.
{5:7} There shall not be to thee other gods before me.
{5:8} Thou shalt not make to thee a carved thing, any appearance that is in the heavens from above, and which is in the earth underneath, and that is in the waters under the earth:
{5:9} Thou shalt not worship to them, and thou shalt not serve them; for I Jehovah thy God, a jealous God, striking the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and the fourth for hating me,
{5:10} And doing mercy to thousands for loving me and for watching my commands.
{5:11} Thou shalt not lift up the name of Jehovah thy God for evil, for Jehovah will not acquit whoever shall lift up his name for evil.
{5:12} Watch the day of the Sabbath to consecrate it, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee.
{5:13} Six days thou shalt work and do all thy work,
{5:14} And the seventh day, the Sabbath to Jehovah thy God: thou shalt not do any work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy servant, and thy maid, and thine ox, and thine ass, and all thy cattle, and thy stranger who is in thy gates; so that thy servant and thy maid shall rest like thyself.
{5:15} And remember that thou wert a servant in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God brought thee out from there by a strong hand and by an extended arm: for this, Jehovah thy God commanded thee to do the day of the Sabbath.
{5:16} Honor thy father and thy mother, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee, so that thy days shall be prolonged and so that it shall be good to thee upon the land that Jehovah thy God gave to thee,
{5:17} Thou shalt not kill,
{5:18} and thou shalt not commit adultery,
{5:19} and thou shalt not steal.
{5:20} And thou shalt not speak false testimony against thy friend:
{5:21} and thou shalt not desire thy friend's wife; and thou shalt not long for thy friend's house, his field, and his servant, and his maid, his ox and his ass, and all that is to thy friend.
{5:22} These words Jehovah spake to all your gathering in the mount, from the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the gloom, a great voice; and he added not: and he will write them upon two tables of stone and will give them to me.
{5:23} And it will be as ye are hearing the voice from the midst of the darkness (and the mount burnt with fire), and ye will come near to me all the heads of your tribes, and your old men;
{5:24} And ye will say, Jehovah our God caused us to see his glory and his greatness, and his voice we heard from the midst of the fire: this day we saw that God will speak to man and he lived.
{5:25} And now wherefore shall we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we added to hear the voice of Jehovah our God further, and we died.
{5:26} For who of all flesh that heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire like us, and shall live?
{5:27} Come thou near and hear all that Jehovah our God shall say; and thou shalt speak to us all that Jehovah our God will speak to thee: and we heard and we did.
{5:28} And Jehovah will hear the voice of your words in your speaking to me; and Jehovah will say to me, I heard the voice of the words of this people that they spake to thee: they did well all that they spake.
{5:29} Who will give, and were this heart in them, for them to fear me and to watch all my commands all the days, so that it shall be well to them and to their sons forever.
{5:30} Go say to them, Turn back for yourselves to your tents.
{5:31} And thou, stand thou here with me and I will speak to thee all the commands and the laws and the judgments which thou shalt teach them: and they did it in the land I gave to them to possess it.
{5:32} And watch ye to do as Jehovah your God commanded right: ye shall not turn aside to the right and to the left.
{5:33} In all the way that Jehovah your God commanded you, ye shall go, so that ye shall live and it be well to you, and ye prolonged the days upon the land which ye shall possess.
{6:1} And these the commands and the laws and the judgments that Jehovah you God commanded to teach you to do in the land which ye are passing over there to possess it:
{6:2} So that thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God, to watch all his laws and his commands which I am commanding thee, thou and thy son and thy son's son all the days of thy life; and so that thy days shall be prolonged.
{6:3} And hear, O Israel, and watch to do, that it shall be well to thee, and that ye shall multiply greatly as Jehovah the God of your fathers spake to thee, a land flowing with milk and honey.
{6:4} Hear, Israel; Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.
{6:5} And love thou Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might.
{6:6} And these words which I command thee to do shall be upon thy heart;
{6:7} And sharpen them to thy sons, and speak in them in thy resting in thy house, and in thy going in the way, and in thy lying down and in thy rising up.
{6:8} And bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for bands between thine eyes.
{6:9} And write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates.
{6:10} And it was when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee in to the land which he sware to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaak and to Jacob, to give to thee cities great and good which thou didst not build,
{6:11} And houses full of all good which thou filledst not, and wells hewed out which thou hewedst not, and vineyards and olives which thou didst not plant; and thou atest and wert satisfied:
{6:12} Watch to thyself lest thou shalt forget Jehovah who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants,
{6:13} Jehovah thy God shalt thou fear, and him shalt thou serve, and in his name shalt thou swear.
{6:14} Ye shall not go after other gods from the gods of the peoples which are round about you;
{6:15} (For Jehovah thy God a jealous God in the midst of thee) lest the anger of Jehovah thy God shall kindle against thee and destroy thee from the face of the earth.
{6:16} Ye shall not try Jehovah your God, as ye tempted in Massah.
{6:17} Watching, ye shall watch the commands of Jehovah your God, and his testimonies, and his laws that he commanded thee.
{6:18} And do thou the right and the good in the eyes of Jehovah so that it shall be well to thee, and thou go in and possess the good land which Jehovah sware to thy fathers,
{6:19} To drive out all thine enemies from before thee as Jehovah spake.
{6:20} When thy son shall ask thee tomorrow, saying, What the testimonies and the laws and the judgments which Jehovah our God commanded you?
{6:21} And say thou to thy son, We were servants to Pharaoh in Egypt, and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt by a strong hand:
{6:22} And Jehovah will give signs and wonders, great and evil, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh and upon all his house before our eyes:
{6:23} And he brought us out from there in order to bring us in to give to us the land which he sware to our fathers.
{6:24} And Jehovah will command us to do all these laws, to fear Jehovah our God, for good to us all the days, to preserve us alive as this day.
{6:25} And it shall be justice to us when we shall watch to do all these commands before Jehovah our God as he commanded us.
{7:1} When Jehovah thy God shall bring thee to the, land where thou goest there to possess it, and he cast out many nations from before thee, the Hittite and the Girgashite and the Amorite and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite and the Jebusite, seven nations many and strong above thee;
{7:2} And Jehovah thy God gave them before thee, and thou didst smite them: exterminating, thou shalt exterminate them; thou shalt not make to them a covenant and thou shalt not show them mercy.
{7:3} Thou shall not marry with them; thy daughters thou shalt not give to his son, and his daughter thou shalt not take to thy son.
{7:4} For he will turn away thy son from after me and they served other gods: and the anger of Jehovah kindled against you and he destroyed thee suddenly.
{7:5} But thus shall ye do to them; their altars ye shall destroy, and their pillars ye shall break in pieces, and their statues ye shall cut down, and their carved things ye shall burn in are.
{7:6} For thou a holy people to Jehovah thy God: in thee Jehovah thy God chose to be to him a people of property from all the peoples which are upon the face of the earth.
{7:7} Not for your multitude did Jehovah delight in you above all the peoples, and will he choose you, for ye were few more than all the peoples.
{7:8} For Jehovah loves you and watches the oath which he sware to your fathers: Jehovah brought you out by a strong hand, and he will redeem thee from the house of servants, from the house of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
{7:9} And know thou that Jehovah thy God, he is God, the faithful God, watching the covenant and the kindness to those loving him, and to those watching his commands to the thousandth generation:
{7:10} And recompensing to those hating him to their face to destroy him: he will not delay to him hating him to his face; he will recompense to him.
{7:11} And watch thou the commands and the laws and the judgments which I command thee this day, to do them.
{7:12} And it was because ye shall hear these judgments, and watch them and do them, and Jehovah thy God watched to thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware to thy fathers:
{7:13} And he loved thee and blessed thee, and multiplied thee: and he blest the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy grain and thy new wine and thy new oil, and the young of thy cows and thy flocks of sheep, upon the land which he sware to thy fathers to give to thee.
{7:14} Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be in thee barren male and female, and in thy cattle.
{7:15} And Jehovah turned away from thee all sickness; and all the evil diseases of Egypt which thou knewest, he will not put upon thee: and he will give them upon all hating thee.
{7:16} And thou didst consume all the peoples which Jehovah thy God gave to thee; thine eye shall not have pity upon them, and thou shalt not serve their gods, for it is a snare to thee.
{7:17} When thou shalt say in thy heart, The nations many more than I, how shall I be able to dispossess them?
{7:18} Thou shalt not be afraid of them: remembering; thou shalt remember what Jehovah thy God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.
{7:19} The great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs and the wonders; and the strong hand and the extended arm by which Jehovah thy God brought thee out: so shall Jehovah thy God do to all people of whose face thou art afraid.
{7:20} And also the hornet, Jehovah thy God will send among you till the destroying of those being left and of those hiding from thy face.
{7:21} Thou shalt not be terrified from their faces, for Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a great and fearful God.
{7:22} And Jehovah thy God cast out these nations from thy face, little, little; thou shalt not be able to finish them quickly lest the beast of the field shall multiply upon thee.
{7:23} And Jehovah thy God gave them before thee and destroyed and discomfited them in great consternation till he destroyed them.
{7:24} And he gave their kings into thy hand, and destroy thou their name from under the heavens; and a man shall not stand before thee till thy destroying them.
{7:25} The carved thing of their gods ye shall burn in fire: thou shalt not desire the silver and gold upon them and take to thee lest thou shalt be snared by it, for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God.
{7:26} And thou shalt not bring an abomination to thy house, and thou be devoted to destruction like it: abhorring, thou shalt abhor it, and abominating, thou shalt abominate it, for it is devoted to destruction.
{8:1} All the commands which I command thee this day ye shall watch to do, so that ye shall live and multiply and go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware to your fathers.
{8:2} And remember thou all the way which Jehovah thy God caused thee to go this forty years in the desert in order to humble thee, to try thee, to know what is in thy heart, whether thou shalt watch his commands or not.
{8:3} And he will humble thee, and cause thee to hunger, and will give thee to eat manna which thou knewest not, and thy fathers knew not; so that he caused thee to know that upon bread only man shall not live, but upon all going out of the mouth of Jehovah shall man live.
{8:4} Thy garments decayed not from thee, and thy feet swelled not this forty years.
{8:5} And know thou with thy heart that as a man will chastise his son, Jehovah thy God chastises thee.
{8:6} And watch thou the commands of Jehovah thy God, to go in his ways and to fear him.
{8:7} For Jehovah thy God brings thee to a good land, a land of torrents of water, fountains, and depths going forth in the valley and in the mountain;
{8:8} A land of wheat and barley and the vine and the fig tree and the pomegranate, a land of the olive tree, of oil and honey;
{8:9} A land where thou shalt eat bread in it not with poverty; thou shalt not want any thing in it; a land whose stones, iron, and out of its mountains thou shalt hew out brass.
{8:10} And thou atest and wert satisfied, and didst bless Jehovah thy God for the good land which he gave to thee.
{8:11} Watch to thyself lest thou shalt forget Jehovah thy God, not watching his commands and his judgments and his laws which I command thee this day:
{8:12} Lest thou shalt eat and thou wert satisfied, and thou wilt build good houses and thou dwelt;
{8:13} And thy cattle and thy sheep shall multiply, and thy silver and thy gold shall multiply to thee, and all which is in thee shall multiply;
{8:14} And thy heart was lifted up and thou didst forget Jehovah thy God bringing thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants;
{8:15} He causing thee to go in the great and fearful desert, the fiery serpent and the scorpion, and a thirsty land, where is no water: he bringing forth to thee water from the rock of flint;
{8:16} He giving thee to eat manna in the desert which thy fathers knew not, in order to humble thee, and in order to try thee to do thee good in thy lost state:
{8:17} And thou saidst in thy heart, My strength and the bone of my handmade for me this wealth.
{8:18} And remember Jehovah thy God; for he gave to thee strength to make wealth in order to set up his covenant, which he sware to our fathers, as this day.
{8:19} And it was, if forgetting, thou shalt forget Jehovah thy God, and thou wentest after other gods, and served them and worshipped to them, I testified against you this day, that perishing, ye shall perish.
{8:20} As the nations which Jehovah destroys before you, so shall ye be destroyed, because ye will not hear to the voice of Jehovah your God.
{9:1} Hear, Israel: Thou passest this day over Jordan to go to possess nations great and strong above thee; cities great and fortified to the heavens:
{9:2} A people great and high, sons of Anakims, whom thou knewest, and thou heardest, Who shall stand before the sons of Anak?
{9:3} And know thou this day that Jehovah thy God he is passing over before thee; he is a consuming fire, he will destroy them, and he will humble them before thy face, and drive them out and destroy them quickly, as Jehovah spake to thee.
{9:4} Thou shalt not say in thy heart in Jehovah thy God's thrusting them out from before thee, saying, For my justice Jehovah brought me forth to possess this land; and for the injustice of these nations Jehovah dispossessed them from before thee.
{9:5} Not for thy justice and for the straightness of thy heart thou goest in to possess this land, but for the injustice of these nations Jehovah thy God dispossesses them from before thee, and order to lift up the word which he sware to thy fathers, to Abraham and to Isaak and to Jacob.
{9:6} And know thou that not for thy justice did Jehovah thy God five to thee this good land to possess it; for thou a people of a hard neck.
{9:7} Remembering, thou shalt not forget that thou didst provoke Jehovah thy God to anger in the desert: from the day thou didst go out from the land of Egypt till your coming to this place, ye were rebelling against Jehovah.
{9:8} And in Horeb ye provoked Jehovah to anger, and Jehovah will be angry with you to destroy you.
{9:9} In my going up to the mount to take the tables of stone, the tables of the covenant which Jehovah made with you, and I shall dwell in the mountain forty days and forty nights; I ate not bread and I drank not water:
{9:10} And Jehovah will give to me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and upon them according to all the words which Jehovah spake with you in the mountain out of the midst of the fire, in the day of the gathering.
{9:11} And it shall be from the end of forty days and forty nights, Jehovah gave to me the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant.
{9:12} And Jehovah will say to me, Arise, go from this mountain; for thy people were corrupted which thou broughtest forth from Egypt; they turned aside quickly from the way which thou didst command them; they made to themselves a molten thing.
{9:13} And Jehovah will say to me, saying, I saw this people, and behold, it a people of hard neck:
{9:14} Desist from me and I will destroy them, and I will wipe off their name from under the heavens: and I will make thee into a nation strong and many above them.
{9:15} And I shall turn and come down from the mount, and the mount burnt with fire: and the two tables of the covenant upon my two hands.
{9:16} And I shall see, and behold, ye sinned against Jehovah your God; ye made to you a molten calf; ye turned aside quickly from the way which Jehovah commanded you.
{9:17} And I shall lay hold upon the two tables and I shall cast them from out of my two hands, and shall break them before your eyes.
{9:18} And I shall fall down before Jehovah as at the first; forty days and forty nights I ate not bread and I drank not water on account of all your sins that ye sinned to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah to provoke him.
{9:19} For I was afraid from the face of the anger and emotion with which Jehovah was angry against you to destroy you. And Jehovah will hear to me also in this time.
{9:20} And with Aaron Jehovah was greatly angry to destroy him: and I shall pray also for Aaron in that time.
{9:21} And the sin that ye made, the calf, I took and I shall burn it with fire, and beat it, and grinding small till it was beat small to dust: and I shall cast its dust into the torrent going down from the mount.
{9:22} And in Taberah and in Massah, and in Kibroth Hatavah, ye were provoking Jehovah to anger.
{9:23} And in Jehovah's sending you from Kadesh-Barnea, saying; Go ye up and possess the land which I gave to you: and ye will rebel against the mouth of Jehovah your God, and ye trusted not to him, and ye heard not to his voice.
{9:24} And ye were rebelling against Jehovah from the day I knew you.
{9:25} And I shall fall down before Jehovah forty days and forty nights, as I fell down; for Jehovah said to destroy you.
{9:26} And I shall pray to Jehovah, and say, Lord Jehovah, thou wilt not destroy thy people and thine inheritance which thou didst redeem in thy greatness, whom thou broughtest out of Egypt with a strong hand.
{9:27} Remember thy servants, for Abraham, for Isaak, and for Jacob, thou wilt not look to the stubbornness of this people, and to its wickedness, and to its sin:
{9:28} Lest they of the land where thou broughtest us from there shall say, For Jehovah was not able to bring them in to the land which he spake to them; and for his hating them he brought them out to destroy them in the desert.
{9:29} And they are thy people and thine inheritance whom thou broughtest out by thy great strength and by thine extended arm.
{10:1} In that time Jehovah said to me, Hew to thee two tables of stone as the first, and come up to me to the mount, and make to thee an ark of wood.
{10:2} And I will write upon the tables the words which were upon the first tables which thou brakest, and put them in the ark.
{10:3} And I will make the ark of acacia wood, and I will hew two tables of stone as the first, and I will go up to the mount and the two tables in my hands.
{10:4} And he will write upon the tables according to the first writing, the ten words which Jehovah your God spake out of the midst of the fire, in the day of the gathering: and Jehovah will give them to me.
{10:5} And I shall turn and come down from the mount, and shall put the tables in the ark which I made; and they shall be there as Jehovah commanded me.
{10:6} And the sons of Israel removed from Beeroth of the sons of Jaakan, to Moseroth: there Aaron died, and he will be buried there; and Eleazar his son will be priest in his stead.
{10:7} From there they removed to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbah, a land of torrents of water.
{10:8} In that time Jehovah separated the tribe of Levi, to lift up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to serve him, and to praise in his name, even to this day.
{10:9} For this, there was not to Levi a portion and an inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah, he is his inheritance, as Jehovah thy God spake to him.
{10:10} And I stood in the mount according to the first days, forty days and forty nights; and Jehovah will hear to me also in this time; Jehovah was not willing to destroy thee.
{10:11} And Jehovah will say to me, Arise, go for removing before the people, and they shall come in and possess the land Which I sware to their fathers to give to them.
{10:12} And now, Israel, what does Jehovah thy God ask from thee but to fear Jehovah thy God, to go in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
{10:13} To watch the commands of Jehovah and his laws which I command thee this day, to be good for thee?
{10:14} Behold, to Jehovah thy God the heavens, and the heavens of the heavens, the earth and all which is in it.
{10:15} Only Jehovah delighted in thy fathers to love them, and he will choose in their seed after them in you above all peoples, as this day.
{10:16} And circumcise the uncircumcision of your heart, and ye shall no more harden your neck.
{10:17} For Jehovah your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords; the great, the strong, and the fearful God, who will not lift up faces, and will not take a gift.
{10:18} He did the judgment of the orphan and the widow, and he loved the stranger to give to him bread and a garment.
{10:19} And love ye the stranger, for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
{10:20} Jehovah thy God shalt thou fear; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and in his name shalt thou swear.
{10:21} He thy praise, and he thy God who did with thee these great and terrible things which thine eyes saw.
{10:22} With seventy souls thy fathers went down to Egypt; and now Jehovah set thee as the stain of the heavens for multitude.
{11:1} And love thou Jehovah thy God, and watch his watches and his laws and his judgments and his commands, all the days.
{11:2} And know ye this day, that not with your sons who knew not, and who saw not the corrections of Jehovah your God, his greatness, his strong hand and his extended arm,
{11:3} And his signs and his doings which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to all his land;
{11:4} And what he did to the army of Egypt, to his horses and to his chariots, that he caused the water of the sea of sedge to overflow upon their face in their pursuing after you, and Jehovah will destroy them even to this day;
{11:5} And what he did to you in the desert till your coming to this place;
{11:6} And what he did to Dathan and to Abiram, sons of Eliab, son of Reuben; that the earth opened her mouth and she will swallow them down, and their houses, and their tents, and every living thing which is at their feet in the midst of all Israel:
{11:7} For your eyes saw every great doing of Jehovah which he did.
{11:8} And watch ye every command which I command thee this day, so that ye shall be strengthened and go in and possess the land where ye are passing over there to possess it;
{11:9} And so that ye shall prolong the days upon the land which Jehovah sware to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed; a land flowing milk and honey.
{11:10} For the land where thou goest in there to possess it, it is not as the land of Egypt, where ye came from there, when thou shalt sow thy seed, and thou wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of green things:
{11:11} And the land where ye are passing over there to possess it, a land of mountains and valleys; according to the rain of the heavens it will drink water.
{11:12} A land which Jehovah thy God sought for it: continually are the eyes of Jehovah thy God upon it from the beginning of the year, and even to the last of the year.
{11:13} And it was if hearing, ye shall hear to the commands which I command you this day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
{11:14} And I gave the rain of your land in its time, the early and the latter rain; and gather thy grain and thy new wine and thy new oil.
{11:15} And I gave the green herb in thy field for thy cattle, and eat thou and be satisfied.
{11:16} Watch ye to yourselves, lest your heart shall be enticed, and ye turn aside and serve other gods, and worship to them:
{11:17} And the anger of Jehovah kindled against you, and he shut up the heavens and there shall not be rain, and the land shall not give her produce, and ye perished quickly from off the good land that Jehovah gave to you.
{11:18} And put these words upon your heart and upon your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they were for bands between your eyes.
{11:19} And teach them to your sons to speak in them in thy resting in thy house, and in thy walking in the way, and in thy lying down, and in thy rising up.
{11:20} And write them upon the doorposts of thy house and upon thy gates.
{11:21} So that your days shall be multiplied, and the days of your sons, upon the land which Jehovah sware to your fathers to give to them, according to the days of the heavens upon the earth.
{11:22} For if watching, ye shall watch all this command which I command you to do it, to love Jehovah thy God, to go in all his ways, and to cleave to him;
{11:23} And Jehovah dispossessed all these nations from before you, and ye possessed nations great and strong above you.
{11:24} Every place which the sole of your foot shall tread upon it, to you shall it be, from the desert and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, and even to the last sea shall be your boundary.
{11:25} A man shall not stand up against your face: your terror and your fear, Jehovah your God shall give upon the face of all the earth which ye shall tread upon it, as he spake to you.
{11:26} See, I give before you this day, a blessing and a cursing:
{11:27} A blessing when ye shall hear to the commands of Jehovah your God which I command you this day;
{11:28} And a cursing if ye shall not hear to the commands of Jehovah your God, and ye turned aside from the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods which thou knewest not.
{11:29} And it was when Jehovah thy. God shall bring thee in to the land where thou goest in there to possess it, and give thou the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the cursing upon mount Ebal.
{11:30} Are they not in the other side of Jordan behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanite dwelling in the desert over against Gilgal, by the oaks of Moreh?
{11:31} For ye are passing over Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God gave to you; and ye possessed it and dwelt in it.
{11:32} And watch ye to do all the laws and the judgments which I give before you this day.
{12:1} These the laws and the judgments which ye shall watch to do in the land which Jehovah the God of thy fathers gave to thee to possess it all the days which ye live upon the earth.
{12:2} Destroying, ye shall destroy all the places where the nations which ye possess them served there their Gods upon the high mountains, and upon the hills and under every green tree.
{12:3} And break ye down their altars and break in pieces their pillars, and their columns ye shall burn with fire; and the carved things of their gods ye shall hew down, and destroy their names from that place.
{12:4} Ye shall not do so to Jehovah your God.
{12:5} But the place which Jehovah your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, to his dwelling shall ye seek, and there do thou come:
{12:6} And bring there your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices, and your tenths, and the offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your voluntary gifts and the first-born of your cattle and your sheep.
{12:7} And eat there before Jehovah your God, and rejoice in all the stretching forth of your hand, ye and your houses in which Jehovah thy God blessed thee.
{12:8} Ye shall not do according to all we do here this day, every man the right in his eyes.
{12:9} For ye came not yet now to the rest and to the inheritance which Jehovah thy God gave to thee.
{12:10} And pass ye over Jordan and dwell in the land which Jehovah your God causes you to inherit, and he caused rest to you from all your enemies from round about, and ye dwelt confidently:
{12:11} And there was the place which Jehovah your God shall choose in it to cause his name to dwell there; there shall ye bring all which I command you: your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices, your tenths, and the offerings of your hands, and all the choice of your vows which ye shall vow to Jehovah.
{12:12} And rejoice ye before Jehovah your God, ye, and your sons and your daughters, and your servants, and your maids, and the Levite who is in your gates; for not to him a portion and inheritance with you.
{12:13} Watch to thyself lest thou lift up thy burnt-offering in every place which thou shalt see.
{12:14} But in the place which Jehovah shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt bring up thy burnt-offering, and there thou shalt do all I command thee.
{12:15} Only in all the desire of thy soul thou shalt sacrifice and eat flesh according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he gave to thee in all thy gates: the unclean and the clean shall eat it, as the roe and as the stag.
{12:16} Only the blood thou shalt not eat: upon the earth ye shall pour it as water.
{12:17} Thou shalt not be able to eat in thy gates the tenth of thy grain, and thy new wine and thy new oil, and the firstlings of thy herd and thy flocks, and all the vows which thou shalt vow, and thy voluntaries, and the offerings of thy hand:
{12:18} But before Jehovah thy God thou shalt eat it, in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose in it, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy servant, and thy maid, and the Levite which is in thy gates: and rejoice thou before Jehovah thy God in all the stretching forth of thy hand.
{12:19} Watch to thyself lest thou shalt forsake the Levite all thy days upon the earth.
{12:20} When Jehovah thy God shall enlarge thy boundary, as he spake to thee, and thou said; I will eat flesh because thy soul shall desire to eat flesh, in all thy soul desired thou shalt eat flesh.
{12:21} When the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose to put his name there shall be far off from thee, and thou shalt sacrifice from thy cattle and from thy sheep which Jehovah gave to thee, as I commanded thee, and eat thou in thy gates in all thy soul desired.
{12:22} If as he shall eat the roe and the stag, so shalt thou eat it; the unclean and the clean together shall eat it.
{12:23} Only be striving not to eat the blood, for the blood it is the soul; and thou shalt not eat the soul with the flesh.
{12:24} Thou shalt not eat it: upon the earth thou shalt pour it as water.
{12:25} Thou shalt not eat it; so that it shall be well to thee and to thy sons after thee, when thou shalt do right in the eyes of Jehovah.
{12:26} Only thy holy things which shall be to thee, and thy vows, thou shalt lift up and go to the place which Jehovah shall choose:
{12:27} And do thou thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of Jehovah thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of Jehovah thy God, and the flesh thou shalt eat.
{12:28} Watch and hear all these words which I command thee, so that it shall be well to thee and to thy sons after thee, even till forever; for thou shalt do the good and the right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.
{12:29} For Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations where thou goest in there to possess them, from before thee, and thou shalt inherit them, and thou shalt dwell in their land.
{12:30} Watch to thyself lest thou shalt be snared after them after their being destroyed from before thee; and lest thou shalt seek to their gods, saying, How shall these nations serve their gods? and so will I do also.
{12:31} Thou shalt not do so to Jehovah thy God; for every abomination of Jehovah which he hated they did to their gods; for also their sons and their daughters they will burn in fire to their gods.
{12:32} Every word which I command you, ye shall watch to do it: thou shalt not add upon it, and thou shalt not take away from it.
{13:1} When there shall arise in the midst of you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he gave to thee a sign or a wonder,
{13:2} And the sign or the wonder come which he spake to thee, saying, We will go after other gods which we know not, and we will serve them,
{13:3} Thou shalt not hear to the words of that prophet or to that dreamer of dreams: for Jehovah thy God tries you to know whether ye are loving Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
{13:4} Ye shall go after Jehovah your God, and ye shall fear him, and his commands shall ye watch, and to his voice shall ye hear, and ye shall serve him, and to him shall ye cleave.
{13:5} And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall die, for he spake a turning away from Jehovah your God, having brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed thee from the house of servants, to thrust thee away from the way which Jehovah thy God commanded to go in it: and put thou away the evil from the midst of thee.
{13:6} When thy brother, the son of thy mother, shall entice thee, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend who is as thy soul, in secret, saying, We will go and serve other gods which thou knewest not, thou, and thy fathers;
{13:7} From the gods of the people which are round about you, coming near to thee, or being far off from thee, from the end of the earth even to the end of the earth;
{13:8} Thou shalt not be willing to him, and thou shalt not hear to him, and thine eye shall not have compassion upon him, and thou shalt not pity, and thou shalt not cover over him:
{13:9} But killing, thou shalt kill him; thy hand shall be upon him for the first to put him to death, and the hand of all the people at last.
{13:10} And stone him with stones and he died, for he sought to thrust thee away from Jehovah thy God, having brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants.
{13:11} And all Israel shall hear, and shall fear, and they shall not add to do this evil in the midst of thee.
{13:12} When thou shalt hear in one of thy cities which Jehovah thy God gave to thee to dwell there, saying,
{13:13} Men, sons of Belial went forth from the midst of thee, and they will thrust away the inhabitants of their city, saying, We will go and serve other gods which ye knew not;
{13:14} And seek, and examine, and ask, doing well; and behold, the truth and the word certain this abomination being done in the midst of you;
{13:15} Smiting, thou shalt smite the inhabitants of that city with the mouth of the sword, exterminating it, and all that is in it, and its cattle, with the mouth of the sword.
{13:16} And thou shalt gather all its spoil to the midst of its street, and burn in fire the city and all its spoil, wholly, to Jehovah thy God: and it was a heap forever; it shall no more be built.
{13:17} And there shall not cleave upon their hand any thing from that devoted to destruction: so that Jehovah shall turn back from the burning of his anger and give to thee mercy, and compassionate thee, as he sware to thy fathers;
{13:18} When thou shalt hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God to watch all his commands which I command thee this day, to do the right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.
{14:1} Ye the sons of Jehovah your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, and ye shall not put baldness between your eyes for the dead.
{14:2} For thou a holy people to Jehovah thy God, and Jehovah chose in thee to be to him for a people of acquisition above all people which are upon the face of the earth.
{14:3} Thou shalt not eat any abomination.
{14:4} These the cattle which thou shalt eat: the ox, the sheep of the lambs, and the sheep of the goats,
{14:5} The stag, and the roe, and the fallow-deer, and the roe-buck, and the antelope, and the mountain goat, and the gazelle.
{14:6} And an cattle cleaving the hoof and dividing the cleft into two hoofs, bringing up rumination among the cattle, ye shall eat it.
{14:7} But this ye shall not eat, from those bringing up rumination, or from those cleaving the hoof of the cleft: the camel and the hare, and the coney; for they bringing up rumination and cleaving not the hoofs; they are unclean to you.
{14:8} And the swine, because it cleaves the hoof, and not ruminating, it is unclean to you: from their flesh ye shall not eat, and upon their carcass ye shall not touch.
{14:9} This shall ye eat from all which is in the waters: all which to it are fins and scales, ye shall eat:
{14:10} And every thing which to it are not fins and scales, ye shall not eat; it is unclean to you.
{14:11} All clean birds ye shall eat.
{14:12} And this which ye shall not eat from them: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the sea eagle,
{14:13} And the vulture, and the kite, and the falcon according to its kind,
{14:14} And every raven according to his kind,
{14:15} And the daughter of the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-gull, and the hawk after his kind,
{14:16} The cormorant, and the ibis and the heron,
{14:17} And the pelican, and the carrion vulture, and the gannet,
{14:18} And the stork, and the sand-piper, according to her kind; the hoopoe and the bat.
{14:19} And every creeping thing flying it is unclean to you; they shall not be eaten.
{14:20} Every clean flying thing ye shall eat.
{14:21} Ye shall not eat any carcass: to the stranger that is in thy gates ye shall give it, and he shall eat it; or sell it to a foreigner: for thou a holy people to Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in his mother's milk.
{14:22} Taking the tenth, thou shalt take the tenth of all thy produce of thy used of the field bringing forth year by year.
{14:23} And eat before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose to cause his name to dwell there, the tenth of thy grain, thy new wine, and thy new oil, and first-born of thy cattle and thy sheep, so that thou shalt learn to fear Jehovah thy God all the days.
{14:24} And when the way shall be enlarged too much for thee that thou shalt not be able to lift it up; when the place shall be far off from thee which Jehovah thy God shall choose to put his name there, when Jehovah thy God shall bless thee:
{14:25} And give it in silver, and bind up the silver in thy hand, and go to the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose in it.
{14:26} And give the silver for all which thy soul shall desire, in cattle and in sheep, and in wine, and in strong drink, and in all thy soul shall ask thee: and eat there before Jehovah thy God, and rejoice, thou, and thine house.
{14:27} And the Levite that is in thy gates thou shalt not forsake him; for to him no portion and inheritance with thee.
{14:28} From the end of three years thou shalt bring all the tenth of thy produce in that year, and place thou it in thy gates:
{14:29} And the Levite came (because no portion and inheritance to him with thee) and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow which is in thy gates, and ate and were satisfied; so that Jehovah thy God shall bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou shalt do.
{15:1} From the end of seven years thou shalt make a remission:
{15:2} And this the word of the remission: Every lord to release the lending of his hand which he shall put upon his friend; he shall not exact his friend and his brother, for a remission was called to Jehovah.
{15:3} Foreigners thou shalt exact of, and what shall be to thee with thy brother thine hand shall remit:
{15:4} Only when no needy shall be with thee; for Jehovah blessing will bless thee in the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance to possess it:
{15:5} Only if hearing, thou shalt hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to watch to do all these commands which I command thee this day.
{15:6} For Jehovah thy God blessed thee as he spake to thee: and thou didst lend to many nations, and thou shalt not borrow; and thou didst rule over many nations, and they shall not rule over thee.
{15:7} When the needy shall be among thee, from one of thy brethren, in one of thy gates in thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, thou shalt not harden thy heart, and thou shalt not shut thy hand from thy needy brother.
{15:8} For opening, thou shalt open thy hand to him, and lending, thou shalt lend him a sufficiency for his want which he shall want.
{15:9} Watch to thyself lest a word shall be with thy heart, of Belial, saying. The seventh year, the year of remission is drawing near; and thine eye be evil against thy needy brother and thou wilt not give to him; and he call against thee to Jehovah, and it was sin in thee.
{15:10} Giving, thou shalt give to him, and thy heart shall not be evil in thy giving to him; for because of this word Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all thy works, and in all the sending forth of thy hand.
{15:11} For the needy shall not cease from the midst of thy land: for this I command thee, saying, Opening, thou shalt open thy hand to thy brother, to thy afflicted and to thy needy in thy land.
{15:12} When thy brother a Hebrew, or Hebrewess, shall be sold to thee, and serving thee six years; in the seventh year thou shalt send him away free from thee.
{15:13} And when thou shalt send him away free from thee, thou shalt not send him away empty.
{15:14} Furnishing, thou shalt furnish to him from thy sheep and from thy threshing floor, and from thy wine-vat: with which Jehovah thy God blessed thee thou shalt give to him.
{15:15} And remember that thou wert a servant in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God will redeem thee: for I command thee this word this day.
{15:16} And it was when he shall say to thee, I will not go forth from thee; for he loved thee and thy house, for it was well to him with thee;
{15:17} And take an awl and give it upon his ear, and against the door, and he was to thee for a servant forever. And also to thy maid shalt thou do thus.
{15:18} It shall not be hard in thine eye in thy sending him away free from thee, because for the year of the wages of the hireling he served thee six years: and Jehovah thy God blessed thee in all which thou shalt do.
{15:19} All the first-born that shall be brought forth among thy cattle and among thy sheep, the male thou shalt consecrate to Jehovah thy God: thou shalt not work with the first-born of thy bullock, and thou shalt not shear first-born of thy sheep.
{15:20} Before Jehovah thy God thou shalt eat it year by year, in the place which Jehovah shall choose, thou, and thy house.
{15:21} And when a blemish shall be in it, lame or blind, any evil blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it to Jehovah thy God.
{15:22} In thy gates thou shalt eat it: the unclean and the clean together, as the roe and the stag.
{15:23} Only its blood thou shalt not eat: upon the earth shalt thou pour it as water.
{16:1} Watch the month of Abib, and do the passover to Jehovah thy God: for in the month of Abib Jehovah thy God brought thee out of Egypt by night.
{16:2} And sacrifice the passover to Jehovah thy God, of the sheep, and the oxen in the place which Jehovah shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.
{16:3} Thou shalt not eat upon it leavened; seven days thou shalt eat upon it unleavened, the bread of affliction; (for in hasty flight thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt) so that thou shalt remember the day of thy coming forth from the land of Egypt all the days of thy life,
{16:4} And leaven shall not be seen to thee in all thy boundary seven days; and there shall not remain over night from the flesh which thou shalt sacrifice in the evening, in the first day to the morning.
{16:5} Thou shalt not be able to sacrifice the passover in one of thy gates which Jehovah thy God gave to thee.
{16:6} But at the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there, thou shalt sacrifice the passover in the evening, as the sun went down, the appointment of thy coming out of Egypt.
{16:7} And boil thou and eat in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose in it: and turn in the morning and go to thy tents.
{16:8} Six days shalt thou eat unleavened, and in the seventh day an enclosing to Jehovah thy God: thou shalt not do work.
{16:9} Seven weeks shalt thou number to thee: from the beginning of the sickle upon the standing grain, thou shalt begin to number seven weeks.
{16:10} And do thou the festival of weeks to Jehovah thy God according to the willingness of thy hand which thou shalt give as Jehovah thy God shall bless thee.
{16:11} And rejoice before Jehovah thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy servant, and thy maid, and the Levite that is in thy gates, and the stranger, and the orphan and the widow, which are in the midst of thee in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.
{16:12} And remember that thou wert a servant in Egypt: and watch thou and do these laws.
{16:13} The festival of booths thou shalt do to thee seven days, in thy gathering of thy threshing floor and of thy wine press.
{16:14} And rejoice in thy festival, thou and thy son and thy daughter, and thy servant, and thy maid, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow, which are in thy gates:
{16:15} Seven days shalt thou keep a festival to Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah shall choose; for Jehovah thy God shall bless thee in all thy produce and in all the work of thy hands, and thou shalt surely be joyful.
{16:16} Three times in a year shall every one of thy males be seen before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose in the festival of unleavened, and in the festival of weeks, and in the festival of booths: and he shall not be seen before Jehovah empty:
{16:17} Each according to the gift of his hand, according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he gave to thee.
{16:18} Judges and scribes shall thou give to thee in all thy gates which Jehovah thy God gave to thee according to thy tribes: and they judged the people just judgment.
{16:19} Thou shalt not turn away Judgment; thou shalt not look upon and thou shalt not take a gift, for the gift will blind the eyes of the wise and will pervert the words of the just.
{16:20} Justice, justice shalt thou follow, so that thou live and inherit the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee.
{16:21} Thou shalt not plant to thee a grove of any wood near the altar of Jehovah thy God which thou shalt make to thee.
{16:22} And thou shalt not set up to thee a pillar, which Jehovah thy God hates.
{17:1} Thou shalt not sacrifice to Jehovah thy God an ox and a sheep which shall be in it a blemish, any evil word, for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God.
{17:2} When there shall be found in the midst of thee in one of thy gates which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, a man or a woman who shall do evil in the eyes of Jehovah thy God to pass by his covenant,
{17:3} And he will go and serve other gods and will worship to them, and to the sun or to the moon, or to any of the army of the heavens, which I commanded not;
{17:4} And it was announced to thee, and thou heardest and sought out, doing well; and behold, the truth and the word certain this abomination being done in Israel.
{17:5} And bring thou forth that man or that woman who did this evil word, to thy gates, the man and the woman, and stone them with stones, and they died.
{17:6} At the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses they shall be put to death; they shall not die by the mouth of one witness.
{17:7} The hand of the witnesses shall be at first upon him to put him to death, and the hand of all the people afterward. And put thou away the evil from the midst of thee.
{17:8} When a word shall be hard for thee for judging between blood to blood, between controversy to controversy, and between blow to blow, words of contention in thy gates; and thou didst arise and go up to the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose in it;
{17:9} And thou didst go to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge which shall be in those days, and seek out; and they shall announce to thee the word of judgment.
{17:10} And thou shalt do according to the mouth of the word which they shall announce to thee from that place which Jehovah shall choose; and thou shalt watch to do according to all which they shall shew thee:
{17:11} According to the mouth of the precept which they shall shew thee, and according to the judgment which they shall say to thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not turn aside from the word which they shall announce to thee, to the right, and to the left.
{17:12} And the man which shall do in pride not to hear to the priest, he standing to serve there Jehovah thy God, or to the judge, and that man shall die: and put thou away evil from Israel.
{17:13} And all the people shall hear, and shall fear, and shall no more act proudly.
{17:14} When thou shalt come to the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, and shall possess it and shall dwell in it, and thou saidst, I will set over me a king according to all the nations which are round about me;
{17:15} Setting, thou shalt set over thee a king whom Jehovah thy God shall choose in him: from the midst of thy brethren thou shalt set over thee a king: thou shalt not be able to set over thee a foreigner who is not of thy brethren.
{17:16} Only he shall not multiply to himself horses, and he shall not turn back the people to Egypt in order to multiply the horse: and Jehovah said to you, Ye shall no more add to turn back that way.
{17:17} And he shall not multiply to him wives, and his heart shall not turn away: and silver and gold he shall not greatly multiply to himself.
{17:18} And it was when he sits upon the throne of his kingdom and he wrote for him this second law upon a book, from before the priests, the Levites.
{17:19} And it shall be with him, and he read in it all the days of his life; so that he shall learn to fear Jehovah his God, to watch all the words of this instruction and these laws to do them:
{17:20} Not to lift up his head above his brethren, and not to turn away from the commands, to the right or to the left; so that he shall prolong the days upon his kingdom he, and his sons in the midst of Israel.
{18:1} There shall not be to the priests the Levites, all the tribe of Levi, part and inheritance with Israel: the sacrifices of Jehovah and his inheritance they shall eat.
{18:2} And an inheritance shall not be to him in the midst of his brethren: Jehovah, he is his inheritance, as he spake to him.
{18:3} And this shall be the judgment of the priests from the people, from those sacrificing a sacrifice, whether an ox or a sheep; and give to the priest the shoulder, the cheeks and the maw.
{18:4} The first fruits of thy grain, of thy new wine, and thy new oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep thou shalt give to him.
{18:5} For in him Jehovah thy God chose from all thy tribes to stand to serve in the name of Jehovah, he and his sons all the days.
{18:6} And when the Levite shall come from one of thy gates from all Israel where he sojourned there, and he came with all the desire of his soul to the place which Jehovah shall choose:
{18:7} And serving in the name of Jehovah his God as all his brethren the Levites standing there before Jehovah.
{18:8} Portion according to portion shall they eat, besides his sellings according to the fathers.
{18:9} When thou comest to the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, thou shalt not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations.
{18:10} There shall not be found in thee him causing his son or his daughter to pass through in fire, divining divinations, practicing magic, and taking omens and a sorcerer,
{18:11} And charming a spell, and asking of a necromancer, and a wizard, and seeking to the dead.
{18:12} For every one doing these things is an abomination to Jehovah And on account of these abominations, Jehovah thy God destroys them from thy face.
{18:13} Thou shalt be perfect with Jehovah thy God.
{18:14} For these nations which thou shalt possess them, they will hear to those practicing magic, and to those divining: and thou, not thus, gave Jehovah thy God to thee.
{18:15} A prophet from the midst of thee, from thy brethren, like me Jehovah thy God shall raise up to thee; to him shall ye hear.
{18:16} According to all thou didst ask from Jehovah thy God in Horeb, in the day of the gathering, saying, I will not add to hear the voice of Jehovah my God, and this great fire I will no more see, and I shall not die.
{18:17} And Jehovah will say to me, They did well in what they spake.
{18:18} A prophet will I raise up to them from the midst of their brethren, like thee, and I gave my word in his mouth, and he spake to them all that I shall command him.
{18:19} And it was the man who shall not hear to my word which he shall speak in my name, I will require from him.
{18:20} But the prophet which shall act proudly to speak the word in my name which I commanded him not to speak, and who shall speak in the name of other gods, and that prophet died.
{18:21} And when thou shalt say in thy heart, How shall we know the word which Jehovah spake not?
{18:22} The prophet who shall speak in the name of Jehovah, and the word shall not be and shall not come, it is the word that Jehovah spake not; in pride the prophet spake it: thou shalt not be afraid of him.
{19:1} When Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations which Jehovah thy God gave to thee their land, and thou didst possess and dwell in their cities, and in their houses;
{19:2} Three cities shalt thou separate to thee in the midst of thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee to possess it.
{19:3} Thou shalt prepare to thee the way, and divide into three parts the boundary of thy land which Jehovah thy God causes thee to inherit; and it was for every slayer to flee there.
{19:4} And this the word of the slayer which shall flee there, and he lived: whoever shall strike his friend, not knowing, and he hated him not from yesterday the third day;
{19:5} And who shall go with his friend into the forest to cut wood, and his hand thrust out with the axe to out down the tree, and the iron slipped from the wood and found his friend, and he died; he shall flee to one of these cities, and he lived:
{19:6} Lest the nearest relative of blood shall pursue after the slayer when his heart shall be warm, and overtaking him, for the way shall be great, and he smote him in soul; and to him not the judgment of death for he hated him not from yesterday the third day.
{19:7} For this I command thee, saying, Three cities thou shalt separate to thee.
{19:8} And if Jehovah thy God shall enlarge thy bound as he sware to thy fathers, and give to thee all the land which he spake to give to thy fathers;
{19:9} If thou shalt watch all this command to do it, which I command thee this day, to love Jehovah thy God and to go in his ways all the days; and thou shalt add to thee yet three cities upon these three.
{19:10} And innocent blood shall not be poured out in the midst of thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance, and bloods were upon thee.
{19:11} And if there shall be a man hating his friend and lying in wait for him, and he rose up against him and smote him in soul, and he died, and he fled to one of these cities:
{19:12} And the old men of his city sent and took him from there and gave him into the hand of the nearest relative of blood, and he died.
{19:13} Thine eye shall not pity him and put away innocent blood from Israel, and it was well to thee.
{19:14} Thou shalt not remove the boundary of thy neighbor which they at first set bounds in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee to inherit it.
{19:15} One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, and for any sin, in any sin which he shall sin; by the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses the word shall be established.
{19:16} If a witness of wrong shall rise up against a man to testify apostasy against him;
{19:17} And the two men to whom is the contention stood before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days;
{19:18} And the judges sought out diligently; and behold, a witness of falsehood, the witness of falsehood testified against his brother;
{19:19} And ye did to him as he purposed to do to his brother: and put away evil from the midst of thee.
{19:20} And they remaining shall hear, and fear, and shall no more add to do according to this evil word in the midst of thee.
{19:21} And thine eye shall not pity; soul for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, and foot for foot.
{20:1} When thou shalt go forth to war against thine enemy, and thou sawest horse and chariot, a multitude of people more than thou, thou shalt not be afraid of them, for Jehovah thy God is with thee, he bringing thee up out of the land of Egypt.
{20:2} And it was in your coming near to the war, and the priest approached and spake to the people,
{20:3} And he said to them, Hear, O Israel; ye come near this day to war against your enemies: your heart shall not be cast down, ye shall not fear, and ye shall not take flight, and ye shall not be terrified from their face.
{20:4} For Jehovah your God goes with you to war with you against your enemies, to save you.
{20:5} And the scribes spake to the people, saying, What man who built a new house and consecrated it not? be shall go and turn back to his house, lest he shall die in the war, and another man shall consecrate it.
{20:6} And what man who planted a vineyard, and made it not common? He Shall go and turn back to his house lest he shall die in the war, and another man shall make it common.
{20:7} And what man betrothed a wife and took her not? he shall go and turn back to his house lest he shall die in the war, and another man shall take her.
{20:8} And the scribes shall add to speak to the people, and they said, What man was afraid and cast down of heart? he shall go and turn back to his house, and he shall not melt his brother's heart as his heart.
{20:9} And it was as the scribes finished to speak to the people, and they appointed captains of the armies in the head of the people.
{20:10} When thou shalt come near to a city to war against it, and call peace to it.
{20:11} And it was, if it shall answer thee peace, and it opened to thee, and it was all the people being found in it shall be to thee for tribute and serve thee.
{20:12} And if it will not be at peace with thee, and it made war with thee, and thou besieged against it.
{20:13} And Jehovah thy God gave it into thy hand, and thou didst cut off every one of its males by the mouth of the sword.
{20:14} Only the women and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that shall be in the city, all its spoil thou shalt plunder to thyself: and eat thou the spoil of thine enemies which Jehovah thy God gave to thee.
{20:15} Thus shalt thou do to all the cities greatly far off from thee which are not of the cities of these nations.
{20:16} Only of the cities of these peoples which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance, thou shalt not preserve alive and breathing:
{20:17} For destroying, thou shalt destroy them, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee:
{20:18} So that they shall not teach you to do according to all their abominations to their gods; and ye sinned to Jehovah your God.
{20:19} When thou shalt besiege against a city many days to war against it, to capture it, thou shalt not destroy its wood to thrust an axe upon it; for from it thou shalt eat: and thou shalt not cut it down; for the man the tree of the field, to go from before thee into the fortress.
{20:20} Only the tree which thou shalt know that it is not a tree of food, thou shalt destroy it, and cut down, and build a fortress against the city which made way with thee, till it came down.
{21:1} When there shall be found a wounded in the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, to possess it, fallen in the field, not knowing who smote him:
{21:2} And thy old men and thy judges shall come forth and measure to the cities which are round about him wounded:
{21:3} And it was the the city being near to the wounded, and the old men of the city took a heifer of the kine which was not worked with, and drew not in the yoke:
{21:4} And the old men of that city brought down the heifer to a perennial valley which shall not be worked in it, and shall not be sown, and they break there the neck of the heifer in the valley;
{21:5} And the priests, the sons of Levi, came near, for in them Jehovah thy God chose to serve him and to bless in the name of Jehovah, and by their mouth shall be every controversy and every blow.
{21:6} And all the old men of that city being near to him wounded, shall wash their hands over the heifer having her neck broken in the valley:
{21:7} And they answered and said, Our hands poured not out this blood, and our eyes saw not.
{21:8} Expiate for thy people Israel whom thou didst redeem, O Jehovah, and thou shalt not give innocent blood in the midst of thy people Israel. And the blood was expiated to them.
{21:9} And thou shalt put away innocent blood from the midst of thee when thou shall do the right in the eyes of Jehovah.
{21:10} When thou shalt go forth to war against thine enemy, and Jehovah thy God gave him into thine hand, and thou didst take him captive,
{21:11} And thou sawest in the captivity a woman of beautiful form, and thou didst delight in her, and thou didst take her to thee for a wife;
{21:12} And thou broughtest her to thy house, and she shaved her head and did her nails:
{21:13} And she put away the garment of her captivity from off her, and she dwelt in thy house, and she wept for her father and her mother a month of days: and after that thou shalt go in to her, and thou wert her lord, and she was for wife to thee.
{21:14} And it was, if thou didst not delight in her, and thou sentest her away according to her soul; and selling, thou shalt not sell her for silver; and thou shalt not lay hands upon her because thou didst humble her.
{21:15} When there shall be to a man two wives, the one loved and the one hated, and they bare sons to him, the loved and the hated, and the first-born son was to her being hated:
{21:16} And it was in the day of his causing his sons to inherit what shall be to him, he shall, not be able to make the son of the loved first-born before the son of the hated, the first-born:
{21:17} But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated, the first-born, to give to him the portion of two in all that shall be found to him; for he is the beginning of his strength; to him is the judgment of the first-born.
{21:18} If there shall be to a man a son stubborn and rebellious, he not hearing to the voice of his father and to the voice of his mother, and they chastised him, and he will not hear to them:
{21:19} And his father and his mother laid hold on him and brought him to the old men of his city, and to the gate of his place;
{21:20} And they said to the old men of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he heard not to our voice; he is vile, and drinking to excess.
{21:21} And all the men of his city stoned him with stones, and he died: and put thou away evil from the midst of thee, and all Israel shall hear and shall fear.
{21:22} And when there shall be sin in a man of the judgment of death, and he being put to death, and thou shalt hang him upon a tree:
{21:23} His carcass shall not pass the night upon the tree; for burying, ye shall bury him in that day, for he being hung is the curse of God; and thou shalt not defile thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance.
{22:1} Thou shalt not see the ox of thy brother or his sheep wandering, and thou shalt not hide from them: turning back, thou shalt turn them back to thy brother.
{22:2} And if thy brother is not near to thee and thou knew him not, and thou receivedst it in the midst of thy house, and it was with thee till thy brother sought it and thou gavest it back to him.
{22:3} And so shalt thou do to his ass, and so shalt thou do to his garments, and shalt thou do to all lost things of thy brother which shall be lost from him, and thou didst find it; thou shalt not be able to hide.
{22:4} Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fallen in the way, and hide from them: lifting up, thou shalt lift up with him.
{22:5} The equipment of a man shall not be upon a woman, and a man shall not put on a woman's garment, for all doing these things are an abomination to Jehovah thy God.
{22:6} When a bird's nest shall be found before thee in the way in any tree or upon the earth, the young broods or the eggs, and the mother reclining upon the young birds, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the mother upon the sons.
{22:7} Sending, thou shalt send away the mother, and the sons thou shalt take to thee, so that it shall be well to thee and thou prolongedst the days.
{22:8} When thou shalt build a new house thou shalt make a ledge to thy roof, and thou shalt not put bloods upon thy house, if he shall fall from it.
{22:9} Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with a diversity, lest the fulness of thy seed which thou shalt sow shall be consecrated, and the produce of the vineyard.
{22:10} Thou shalt not plough with an ox and ass together.
{22:11} Thou shalt not put on any thing adulterated, wool and linen together.
{22:12} Thou shalt make to thee twisted threads upon the four wings of thy covering with which thou shalt be covered.
{22:13} If any man shall take a wife, and went in to her and hated her,
{22:14} And he set pretexts of words against her, and brought up an evil name upon her, and said, I took this woman, and I shall come near to her, and I found in her not a virgin:
{22:15} And the father of the young girl took, and her mother, and brought the signs of virginity of the young girl to the elders of the city to the gate:
{22:16} And the father of the maiden said to the old men, I gave my daughter to this man for a wife and he will hate her,
{22:17} And behold, he set up pretexts of words, saying, I found not in thy daughter the signs of virginity; and these the signs of my daughter's virginity. And they spread the garment before the old men of the city.
{22:18} And the old men of that city took the man and chastised him;
{22:19} And they amerced him a hundred of silver, and gave to the father of the maiden, for he brought out an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be to him for a wife; he shall not be able to send her away all his days.
{22:20} And if this word was the truth, and the signs of virginity not found for the maiden:
{22:21} And they brought the maiden to the door of the house of her father, and the men of her city stoned her with stones and she died; for she did folly in Israel to commit fornication in her father's house: and thou didst put away evil from the midst of thee.
{22:22} When a man shall be found lying with the woman mistress of a husband, and they died, also they two, the man lying with the woman, and the woman: and thou didst put away evil from Israel.
{22:23} When there shall be a maiden, a virgin, betrothed to a man, and a man found her in the city and lay with her;
{22:24} And ye brought out them two to the gate of that city, and stoned them with stones, and they died; and the maiden for the word which she cried not in the city, and the man for the word which he humbled his neighbor's wife: and thou didst put away evil from the midst of thee.
{22:25} And if in the field the man shall find the betrothed maiden, and the man held fast upon her, and lay with her, and the man that lay with her died alone.
{22:26} And to the maiden thou shalt not do a word; not to the maiden the sin of death: for as a man shall rise up against his friend, and he killed him the soul, so this word.
{22:27} For in the field he found her, the betrothed maiden cried and none saving her.
{22:28} When a man shall find a maiden, a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold upon her and lay with her, and they were found;
{22:29} And the man lying with her gave to the maiden's father fifty of silver, and to him she shall be for a wife; because that he humbled her, he shall not be able to send her away all his days.
{22:30} A man shall not take his father's wife and shall not uncover his father's wing.
{23:1} He wounded by crushing, and having the privy member cut off, shall not come in to the gathering of Jehovah.
{23:2} The corrupted shall not come in to the gathering of Jehovah; also the tenth generation to him shall not come into the gathering of Jehovah.
{23:3} An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not come into the gathering of Jehovah; also the tenth generation to them shall not come in to the gathering of Jehovah, even forever:
{23:4} For the word that they met you not with bread and with water in the way in your coming out of Egypt, and who hired against thee Balaam, son of Beor of Pethor, of Arum of the two rivers, to curse thee.
{23:5} And Jehovah thy God willed not to hear to Balaam: and Jehovah thy God will turn to thee the curse to a blessing, for Jehovah thy God loved thee.
{23:6} Thou shalt not seek their peace and their good all thy days to forever.
{23:7} Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian for thou wert a stranger in his land.
{23:8} The sons which shall be begotten to them, the third generation to them shall come in to the gathering of Jehovah.
{23:9} When the camp shall go forth against thine enemies, and watch thyself from every evil word.
{23:10} If there shall be in thee a man that shall not be clean from chance of the night, and he shall go forth without the camp; he shall not come in to the midst of the camp:
{23:11} And it was turning to evening, he shall wash in water: and as the sun went down he shall come into the midst of the camp.
{23:12} And a hand shall be to thee from without the camp, and thou shalt go forth there without:
{23:13} And a peg shall be to thee upon thy utensil: and it was in thy sitting down without, and digging with it, and turn thou back and cover thy excrement:
{23:14} For Jehovah thy God goes in the midst of thy camp to deliver thee, and to give thine enemies before thy face; and thy camp was holy; and he will not see in thee the nakedness of a word and turn back from after thee.
{23:15} Thou shalt not deliver the servant to his lord who shall be delivered to thee from his lord.
{23:16} With thee he shall dwell in the midst of thee in the place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, in the good to him: thou shalt not oppress him.
{23:17} Thou shalt not be a harlot from the daughters of Israel, and a male prostitute from the sons of Israel.
{23:18} Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, and the price of a dog to the house of Jehovah thy God, for any vow: for these two are also an abomination to Jehovah thy God.
{23:19} Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother; interest of silver, interest of food, interest of any word which shall be lent on interest.
{23:20} To a foreigner thou shalt lend on interest; and to thy brother thou shalt not lend on interest: so that Jehovah thy God shall bless thee in all the stretching forth of thy hand upon the land which thou goest there to possess it.
{23:21} When thou shalt vow a vow to Jehovah thy God thou shalt not delay to complete it, for Jehovah thy God requiring, will require it from thee; and it was sin in thee.
{23:22} And if thou shalt cease to vow, it shall not be sin in thee.
{23:23} That going out of thy lips, thou shalt watch and do according as thou didst vow to Jehovah thy God; a voluntary gift which thou spakest with thy mouth.
{23:24} When thou shalt come into the vineyard of thy friend, and eat there grapes according to thy soul, to thy satisfying; and thou shalt not give into thy vessel.
{23:25} When thou shalt come into thy friend's standing grain, pluck off the ears with thine hand, and thou shalt not lift up a sickle upon thy friend's standing grain.
{24:1} When a man shall take a wife and he married her, and it was if she shall find not favor in his eyes because he found in her a nakedness of the word: and he wrote for her a writing of cutting off, and gave in her hand, and sent her away from his house.
{24:2} And she shall go out of his house, and go and was to another man.
{24:3} And the last man hated her and wrote for her a writing of cutting off, and gave in her hand, and sent her away from his house; or if the last man shall die which took her to him for a wife,
{24:4} Her first husband who sent her away shall not be able to turn back to take her to be to him for a wife after that she was defiled; for it is an abomination before Jehovah: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance.
{24:5} When a man shall take a new wife, he shall not go out in the war, and nothing shall pass upon him for any word: he shall be free to his house one year, and gladden his wife whom he took.
{24:6} He shall not take the two mill-stones as a pledge, and the rider, for it is taking the soul as a pledge.
{24:7} If a man shall be found stealing a soul from his brethren from the sons of Israel, and shall lay hands upon him and sell him; and that thief died; and put thou away evil from the midst of thee.
{24:8} Watch in the stroke of leprosy to watch greatly, and to do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them ye shall watch to do.
{24:9} Remember what Jehovah thy God did to Miriam in the way, in your coming out of Egypt.
{24:10} When thou shalt lend to thy friend the loan of any thing, thou shalt not go to his house to exchange his pledge:
{24:11} Thou shalt stand without, and the man to whom was lent to him, shall bring out to thee the pledge without.
{24:12} And if the man be poor, he shall not sleep with his pledge.
{24:13} Turning back, thou shalt turn back to him the pledge as the sun went down; he lay down in his garment and blessed thee; and to thee shall be justice before Jehovah thy God.
{24:14} Thou shalt not oppress the poor and needy hireling from thy brethren, or from thy stranger which is in thy land in thy gates.
{24:15} In his day thou shalt give his hire, and the sun shall not go down upon it, for he is poor, and he lifted up his soul to it; and he will cry against thee to Jehovah, and it was sin in thee.
{24:16} The fathers shall not die for the sons, and the sons shall not die for the fathers: a man shall die in his sin.
{24:17} Thou shalt not turn away the judgment of the stranger, the fatherless; and thou shalt not take as a pledge the garment of the widow.
{24:18} And remember that thou wert a servant in Egypt, and Jehovah thy God will redeem thee from thence; for this I commend thee to do this word.
{24:19} When thou shalt reap thy harvest in thy field and didst forget a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not turn back to take it: to the stranger and to the orphan and to the widow shall it be; so that Jehovah thy God shall bless thee in all the doing of thy hands.
{24:20} When thou shalt beat thine olive thou shalt not go over the boughs after thee: to the stranger, to the orphan, and to the widow it shall be.
{24:21} And when thou shalt gather thy vineyard thou shalt not glean after thee; to the stranger, and to the orphan, and to the widow it shall be.
{24:22} And remember that thou wert a servant in the land of Egypt: for this I command thee to do this word.
{25:1} If there shall be a controversy between men and they drew near to judgment, and they judged them; and they justified the just and condemned the unjust.
{25:2} And it was if the unjust be the son of smiting and the judge caused him to fall down and beat him before his face in proportion to his fault, by a number.
{25:3} Forty he shall beat him; He shall not add, lest he shall add to strike him above them with much beating, and thy brother was despised before thine eyes.
{25:4} Thou shalt not muzzle the ox treading.
{25:5} If brethren shall dwell together and one of them died, and a son not to him, the wife of the dead shall not be without to a man a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in to her, and he took her to him for a wife, and he acted the husband's brother to her.
{25:6} And it is the first-born which she shall bear shall rise up upon the name of his brother the dead, and his name shall not be wiped from Israel.
{25:7} And if the man shall not desire to take his brother's wife, and his brother's wife went up to the gate to the old men, and said, My husband's brother refused to raise up to his brother a name in Israel, and he would not act my husband's brother.
{25:8} And the old men of his city called to him and spake to him: and he stood and said, I desired not to take her.
{25:9} And his brother's wife drew near to him before the eyes of the old men, and drew off his shoe from his foot, and spit in his face, and answered and said, Thus shall it be done to the man who will not build up the house of his brother.
{25:10} And his name was called in Israel, The house of him having his shoe drawn off.
{25:11} When men shall strive together, a man and his brother, and the wife of the one come near to deliver her husband from him smiting him, and she stretched forth her hand and held fast by his secrets:
{25:12} And cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity.
{25:13} There shall not be to thee in thy receptacle a stone and a stone, great and small.
{25:14} There shall not be to thee in thy house an ephah and an ephah, great and small.
{25:15} A stone complete and just shall be to thee; an ephah complete and just.
{25:16} For an abomination are all doing these things, all doing evil.
{25:17} Remember what Amalek did to thee in the way, in your coming forth out of Egypt:
{25:18} That he met thee in the way, and he will smite the rear in thee all the enfeebled behind thee, and thou faint and weary: and he feared not God.
{25:19} And it was in Jehovah thy God giving rest to thee from all thine enemies from round about in the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance to possess it, thou shalt wipe out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens; thou shalt not forget.
{26:1} And it was when thou shalt come into the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance to possess it, and thou didst dwell in it:
{26:2} And thou tookest from the first of all the fruit of the land which thou shalt bring from thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, and put in a basket, and go to the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.
{26:3} And go to the priest which shall be in those days, and say to him, I announced this day to Jehovah thy God, that I came to the land which Jehovah aware to our fathers to give to us.
{26:4} And the priest took from thy hand the basket and set it down before the altar of Jehovah thy God.
{26:5} And thou didst answer and say before Jehovah thy God, An unfortunate Syrian my father; and he went down into Egypt, and he will sojourn there with a few men, and will be there into a great nation, mighty and many.
{26:6} And the Egyptians did us evil, and humbled us, and they will distribute to us hard service.
{26:7} And we shall cry to Jehovah the God of our fathers, and Jehovah will hear our voice, and will see our affliction and our labor and our oppression.
{26:8} And Jehovah will bring us forth out of Egypt with a strong hand and with an extended arm, and with great appearance and with signs and with wonders;
{26:9} And he will bring us to this place, and will give us this land, a land flowing milk and honey.
{26:10} And now, behold, I brought the first-fruits of the earth that thou Jehovah gave to me: and set thou it before Jehovah thy God, and worship before Jehovah thy God.
{26:11} And rejoice in all the good that Jehovah thy God gave to thee and to thy house, thou and the Levite and the stranger which is in the midst of them.
{26:12} When thou shalt finish to tithe all the tenth part of thy produce, in the third year the year of the tenth part, and thou gavest it to the Levite and to the stranger and to the orphan and to the widow, and they ate in thy gates and were satisfied.
{26:13} And thou saidst before Jehovah thy God, I took away the holy thing from the house, and also I gave it to the Levite, and to the stranger, to the orphan and to the widow, according to all thy commands which thou didst command me: I passed not by from thy command, and I did not forget.
{26:14} I ate not from it in my mourning, and I took not away from it in uncleanness, and I gave not from it to the dead: I heard to the voice of Jehovah my God, I did according to all thou didst command me.
{26:15} Look forth from thy holy habitation, from the heavens, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou gavest to us, as thou didst swear to our fathers, a land flowing milk and honey.
{26:16} This day Jehovah thy God commands thee to do these laws and judgments: and watch thou to do them with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
{26:17} Thou saidst this day Jehovah to be to thee for God, and to go in his ways, and to watch his laws and his commands, and his judgments, and to hear to his voice.
{26:18} And Jehovah said thee this day to be to him for a people of property, as he spake to thee, and to watch all his commands,
{26:19} And to give thee high above all the nations which he made for a beginning and for a name, and for an ornament, and for thy being a holy people to Jehovah thy God, as he spake.
{27:1} And Moses and the old men of Israel will command the people, saying, Watch every command which I command you this day.
{27:2} And it was in the day which ye shall pass over Jordan to the land that Jehovah thy God gave to thee, and set up to thee great stones, and plaster them with lime.
{27:3} And write upon them all the words of this law in thy passing over, so that thou shalt go in to the land that Jehovah thy God gave to thee; a land flowing milk and honey, as Jehovah the God of thy fathers spake to thee.
{27:4} And being in your passing over Jordan ye shall set up these stones which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and plaster them with lime.
{27:5} And build there an altar to Jehovah thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up iron upon them.
{27:6} Whole stones thou shalt build the altar of Jehovah thy God: and bring up upon it burnt-offerings to Jehovah thy God:
{27:7} And sacrifice peace, and eat there and rejoice before Jehovah thy God.
{27:8} And write upon the stones all the words of this law very diligently.
{27:9} And Moses will speak, and the priests, the Levites, to all Israel, saying, Be silent and hear, Israel; this day thou wert for a people to Jehovah thy God.
{27:10} And hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God and do his commands and his laws which I command thee this day.
{27:11} And Moses will command the people in that day, saying,
{27:12} These shall stand to bless the people upon mount Gerizim, in your passing over Jordan; Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar, and Joseph and Benjamin:
{27:13} And these shall stand for a cursing upon Mount Ebal: Reuben, Gad and Asher and Zebulon, Dan and Naphtali.
{27:14} And the Levites answered and said to every man of Israel in a high voice,
{27:15} Cursed the man, who shall make a graven and molten thing, an abomination of Jehovah, the work of the hand of the artificer, and put it in hiding: and all the people answered and said, Amen.
{27:16} Cursed he making light of his father and his mother: and all the people said, Amen.
{27:17} Cursed he removing the boundary of his neighbor: and all the people said, Amen.
{27:18} Cursed he causing the blind to wander in the way: and all the people said, Amen.
{27:19} Cursing he turning away the judgment of the stranger, the orphan and the widow: and all the people said, Amen.
{27:20} Cursed he lying with his father's wife, for he uncovered his father's wing: and all the people said, Amen.
{27:21} Cursed he lying with any cattle: and all the people said, Amen.
{27:22} Cursed he lying with his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter: and all the people said, Amen.
{27:23} Cursed he lying with his daughter-in-law: and all the people said Amen.
{27:24} Cursed he striking his neighbor in hiding: and all the people said, Amen.
{27:25} Cursed he taking a gift to strike the soul of innocent blood: and all the people said, Amen.
{27:26} Cursed he who shall not raise up the words of this law to do them: and all the people said, Amen.
{28:1} And it being if hearing thou shalt hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to watch and to do all his commands that I command thee this day, and Jehovah thy God gave thee high above all the nations of the earth.
{28:2} And all these blessings came upon thee and overtook thee, when thou shalt hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God.
{28:3} Blessed thou in the city, blessed thou in the field.
{28:4} Blessed the fruit of thy belly, and the fruit of thy land, and the fruit of thy cattle, the offspring of thine oxen and the flocks of thy sheep.
{28:5} Blessed thy basket and thy remainders.
{28:6} Blessed thou in thy coming in, and blessed thou in thy going out.
{28:7} Jehovah will give thine enemies rising up against thee smitten before thy face; in one way shall they come forth against thee, and in seven ways shall they flee before thy face.
{28:8} Jehovah will command with thee the blessing in thy store-houses, and in all the sending forth of thy hand; and he blessed thee in the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee.
{28:9} Jehovah will raise thee up to him for a holy people, as he sware to thee, when thou shalt watch the commands of Jehovah thy God and go in his ways.
{28:10} And all the peoples of the earth saw that the name of Jehovah was called upon thee; and they were afraid of thee.
{28:11} And Jehovah made thee to abound for good in the fruit of thy belly, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, upon the land which Jehovah sware to thy fathers to give to thee.
{28:12} Jehovah will open to thee his good store, the heavens to give the rain of thy land in its time, and to bless all the doing of thy hand: and thou didst lend to many nations, and thou shalt not borrow.
{28:13} And Jehovah gave thee for head, and not for tail: and thou wert only for ascending, and thou shalt not be for beneath; when thou shalt hear to the commands of Jehovah thy God that I command thee this day, to watch and to do.
{28:14} And thou shalt not turn aside from all the words which I command you this day, to the right and to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
{28:15} And it being, if thou shalt not hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to watch to do all his commands and his laws which I command thee this day; and all these curses came upon thee, and overtook thee:
{28:16} Cursed thou in the city, and cursed thou in the field.
{28:17} Cursed thy basket and thy remainders.
{28:18} Cursed the fruit of thy belly, and the fruit of thy land, the offspring of thine oxen, and the flocks of thy sheep.
{28:19} Cursed thou in thy coming in, and cursed thou in thy going out.
{28:20} Jehovah will send upon thee the curse and the consternation, and the rebuke, upon all the sending forth of thy hand which thou shalt do, till he destroyed thee, and till he caused thee to perish quickly: on account of the evil of thy works by which thou forsookest me.
{28:21} Jehovah shall cleave upon thee death, till his consuming thee from the land which thou wentest there to possess it.
{28:22} Jehovah shall strike thee with consumption, and with burning fever, and with inflammation, and with sword and with burning, and with blasting, and with yellowness: and they shall pursue thee till he have destroyed thee.
{28:23} And the heavens which over thy head were brass, and the earth which is under thee, iron.
{28:24} Jehovah will give the rain of thy land dust and clay: from the heavens shall it come down upon thee, till he destroyed thee.
{28:25} And Jehovah will give thee smitten before thine enemies: in one way thou shalt go forth against him, and in seven ways shalt thou flee before his face; and thou wert for a shaking to all the kingdoms of the earth.
{28:26} And thy carcass was for food to all the birds of the heavens and to the cattle of the earth, and none terrifying.
{28:27} Jehovah shall strike thee with the burning sore of Egypt, and with tumors, and with scratching, and with the itch of which thou shalt not be able to be healed.
{28:28} Jehovah will strike thee with madness and with blindness and with astonishment of heart;
{28:29} And thou wert groping at noon as the blind shall grope in darkness, and thou shalt not succeed with thy ways: and thou wert only oppressed and stripped all the days, and none saving.
{28:30} Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build a house and shall not dwell in it; thou shalt plant a vineyard and thou shalt not lay it open.
{28:31} Thine ox slaughtered before thine eyes and thou shalt not eat from it: thine ass stripped from before thee and shall not turn back to thee; thy sheep, given to thine enemies, and none to thee saving.
{28:32} Thy sons and thy daughters given to another people, and thine eyes seeing and failing for them all the day: and nothing for the strength of thy hand.
{28:33} The fruit of thy land and all thy labors, a people which thou knewest not shall eat: and thou wert only oppressed and broken all the days.
{28:34} And thou wert mad from the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
{28:35} Jehovah shall strike thee with an evil burning sore upon thy knees and upon thy legs, which thou shalt not be able to heal from the sole of thy foot to thy crown.
{28:36} Jehovah shall lead thee, and thy king which thou shalt set up over thee, to a nation which thou knewest not thou and thy fathers; and thou servedst there other gods, wood and stone.
{28:37} And thou wert for an astonishment, for a parable, for a sharp saying in all the peoples where Jehovah shall lead thee there.
{28:38} Thou shalt bring out much seed to thy field, and shalt gather little, for the locust shall devour it.
{28:39} Thou shalt plant vineyards and thou shalt work; and thou shalt not drink the wine, and thou shalt not gather, for the worm shall eat it.
{28:40} Olive trees shall be to thee in all thy boundaries, and thou shalt not be anointed with oil, for thine olive shall slip away.
{28:41} And thou shalt beget sons and daughters, and they shall not be to thee, for they shall go into captivity.
{28:42} All thy wood and the fruit of thy land shall the grasshopper seize.
{28:43} The stranger which is in the midst of thee shall go up above thee, going up, going up; and thou shalt go down beneath, beneath.
{28:44} He shall lend to thee and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be for head, and thou shalt be for tail.
{28:45} And all these curses came upon thee and pursued thee and overtook thee, till he destroyed thee; for thou heardst not to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to watch his commands and his laws which he commanded thee.
{28:46} And they were upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed even to forever.
{28:47} Because that thou servedst not Jehovah thy God in joy and in a good heart for the multitude of all things.
{28:48} And thou servedst thine enemies which Jehovah shall send forth against thee in hunger and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things and he gave a yoke of iron upon thy neck till his destroying thee.
{28:49} Jehovah shall raise up against thee a nation from far off, from the extremity of the earth, as the eagle shall fly, whose tongue thou shalt not hear;
{28:50} A nation strong of face who shall not lift up the face to the old man, and shall not compassionate the young.
{28:51} And it shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land till he destroyed thee: which shall not leave to thee grain, new wine or new oil, the offspring of thine oxen and the flocks of thy sheep, till his destroying thee.
{28:52} And he passed upon thee in all thy gates until the coming down of thy high and inaccessible fortresses which thou trustest in them in all thy land: and he passed upon thee in all thy gates in all thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee.
{28:53} And thou atest the fruit of thy belly, the flesh of thy sons and thy daughters, which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, in the distress and in the straitness which thine enemy shall press upon thee:
{28:54} The man tender in thee, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil upon his brother, and upon the wife of his bosom, and upon the remainder of his sons which he shall leave:
{28:55} The gift to one of them of the flesh of his sons which he shall eat from: nothing remaining to him of all things in the distress and in the straitness which his enemy shall press upon thee in all thy gates.
{28:56} She tender and delicate in thee, who tried not to set the sole of her foot upon the earth from delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil upon the husband of her bosom, and upon her son, and upon her daughter,
{28:57} And upon her afterbirth coming forth from between her feet, and upon her sons which she shall bear: for she will eat them in want of all things, in secret, in the distress and in the straitness which thine enemy shall press upon thee in thy gates.
{28:58} If thou shalt not watch to do all the words of this law being written in this book, to fear this honored and fearful name JEHOVAH THY GOD;
{28:59} And Jehovah made thy smiting wonderful, and the smitings of thy seed, great and lasting blows, and evil and lasting diseases.
{28:60} And he turned back upon thee all the sicknesses of Egypt, of which thou west afraid from their face, and they did cleave to thee.
{28:61} Also every disease and every blow which is not written in the book of this law, Jehovah will bring them up upon thee, till he destroyed thee.
{28:62} And ye were left few in extension, instead of which ye were as the stars of the heavens for multitude, because thou heardst not to the voice of Jehovah thy God.
{28:63} And it being as Jehovah rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you, so Jehovah shall rejoice over you to destroy you and to cut you off; and ye were torn away from the land which thou wentest in there to possess it.
{28:64} And Jehovah scattered thee among all peoples from the end of the earth even to the end of the earth; and thou servedst there other gods which thou knewest not, thou and thy fathers, wood and stone.
{28:65} And among these nations thou shalt not rest, and there shall not be rest to the sole of thy foot: and Jehovah gave to thee there a trembling heart and a wasting away of the eyes, and a faintness of soul.
{28:66} And thy lives were hung before thee; and thou wert afraid night and day, and thou shalt not trust to thy life.
{28:67} In the morning thou shalt say, Who shall give evening? and in the evening thou shalt say, Who shall give morning? from the feat of thy heart which thou shalt fear, and from the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
{28:68} And Jehovah turned thee back to Egypt in ships, in the way; which I said to thee, Thou shalt not add more to see it: and ye were sold there to thine enemies for servants, and for maids, and none buying.
{29:1} These the words of the covenant which Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
{29:2} And Moses will call to all Israel and will say, to them, Ye saw all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;
{29:3} The great temptations which thine eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders:
{29:4} And Jehovah gave not to you an heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, even to this day.
{29:5} And I shall lead you forty years in the desert: your garments did not fall away from you, and thy shoe was not warn away from thy foot.
{29:6} Bread ye ate not, and wine and strong drink ye drank not; so that ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God.
{29:7} And ye shall come to this place; and Sihon, king of Heshbon, will come, and Og, king of Bashan, to our meeting, to war; and we shall smite them.
{29:8} And we shall take their land and give it for an inheritance to the Reubenites and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of the Manassites.
{29:9} And watch ye the words of this covenant, and do them, so that ye shall be circumspect in all things which ye shall do.
{29:10} Ye stand this day all of you before Jehovah your God; your heads of your tribes, your old men, and your scribes, every man of Israel;
{29:11} Your little ones, your wives and thy stranger which is in the midst of thy camp, from him cutting thy woods to him drawing thy waters:
{29:12} For thy passing into the covenant of Jehovah thy God, and into his oath, which Jehovah thy God made with thee this day:
{29:13} In order to set thee this day to him for a people, and he shall be to thee for God as he spake to thee, and as he sware to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaak, and to Jacob.
{29:14} And not with you alone do I make this covenant and this oath;
{29:15} But with those being here with us, standing before Jehovah our God, and with those not here with us this day:
{29:16} (For ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we passed through in the midst of the nations which ye passed through;
{29:17} And ye shall see their abominations and their rollings, wood and stone, silver and gold, which are with them:)
{29:18} Lest there be among you man or woman, or family or tribe, whom his heart turn this day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of these nations; lest there be among you a root bearing poverty and wormwood;
{29:19} And it was in his hearing the words of this oath, and he blessed himself in his heart, saying, Peace shall be to me, if in the hardness of my heart, I shall go to add satiating to thirst:
{29:20} Jehovah shall not be willing to forgive him, for then the anger of Jehovah shall smoke, and his jealousy against that man, and every curse written in this book lay upon him, and Jehovah wiped out his name from under the heavens.
{29:21} And Jehovah separated him for evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant written in the book of this law:
{29:22} And said, Another generation of your sons who shall rise up from after you, and the foreigner who shall come from a land afar off, and they saw the blows of that land, and the sicknesses which Jehovah made sick in it;
{29:23} Pitch and burning salt, all its land; it shall not be sown, and it shall not sprout, and no green herb shall come up upon it, as the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger and in his wrath:
{29:24} And all the nations said, For what did Jehovah thus to this land? what the heat of this great anger?
{29:25} And they said, Because they left the covenant of Jehovah the God of their fathers, which he made with them; in his bringing them forth from the land of Egypt.
{29:26} And they will go and serve other gods, and will worship to them gods which they knew them not, and a portion not to them.
{29:27} And the anger of Jehovah will kindle against this land, to bring upon it all the curses written in this book.
{29:28} And Jehovah will tear them up from their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great anger, and will send them to another land as this day.
{29:29} Hidden things to Jehovah our God: and uncovered things to us and to our sons to forever, to do all the words of this law.
{30:1} And it being when all these words shall come upon thee, the blessing, and the curse which I gave before thee, and thou shalt turn back to thy heart in all these nations where Jehovah thy God thrust thee away there,
{30:2} And thou turnedst back to Jehovah thy God, and heardst to his voice according to all which I command thee this day, thou and thy sons, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul:
{30:3} And Jehovah thy God turned back thy captivity, and pitied thee, and he turned back and gathered thee from all the peoples, where Jehovah thy God scattered thee there.
{30:4} If thy expelling shall be to the end of the heavens, from there thy God will gather thee, and from there he will take thee:
{30:5} And Jehovah thy God brought thee to the land which thy fathers inherited, and thou inheritedst it: and he did good to thee and multiplied thee above thy fathers.
{30:6} And Jehovah thy God circumcised thy heart and the heart of thy seed, to love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, for the sake of thy life.
{30:7} And Jehovah thy God gave all these curses upon thine enemies and upon those hating thee, who chased thee.
{30:8} And thou shalt turn back and hear to the voice of Jehovah, and do all his commands which I command thee this day.
{30:9} And Jehovah thy God caused thee to abound in every work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land for good: for Jehovah will turn back to be glad over thee for good as he was glad over thy fathers:
{30:10} If thou shalt hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God to watch his commands and his laws written in the book of this law, if thou shalt turn back to Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
{30:11} For this command which I command thee this day, it was not great for thee, and it was not far off.
{30:12} It is not in the heavens to say, Who shall go up for us to the heavens to take it to us and cause us to hear it and do it?
{30:13} And it is not beyond the sea, to say, Who shall pass over for us to the other side of the sea, and take it to us and cause us to hear it and do it?
{30:14} For the word is very near to thee in thy mouth and in thy heart to do it.
{30:15} See, I gave before thy face this day the life and the good, and the death and the evil;
{30:16} That I command thee this day to love Jehovah thy God, to go in his ways, to watch his commands and his laws and his judgments, and live thou and multiply: and Jehovah thy God blessed thee in the land which thou wentest there to possess it.
{30:17} And if thy heart shall turn aside and thou shalt not hear, and be thrust away and worship to other gods, and serve them;
{30:18} I announced to you this day that perishing, ye shall perish; ye shall not prolong the days upon the land which thou passest over Jordan to go in there to possess it.
{30:19} I called to witness against you this day the heavens and the earth, the life and the death I gave before thee, the blessing and the curse: and choose upon life, so that thou shalt live, thou and thy seed:
{30:20} To love Jehovah thy God; to hear to his voice and to cleave to him (for this thy life and the length of thy days) to dwell upon the land which Jehovah aware to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaak, and to Jacob, to give to them.
{31:1} And Moses will go and speak these words to all Israel.
{31:2} And he will say to them, The son of a hundred and twenty years I this day; I shall no more be able to go out and to come in: and Jehovah said to me, Thou shalt not pass through this Jordan.
{31:3} Jehovah thy God he goes over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and possess thou them: Joshua he passes over before thee as Jehovah spake.
{31:4} And Jehovah did to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and to their land which be destroyed them.
{31:5} And Jehovah gave them before you, and ye did to them according to all the commands which I commanded you.
{31:6} Be strong and be active; ye shall not fear, and ye shall not be terrified from their face, for Jehovah thy God, he goes with thee; he will not relax thee and he will not forsake thee.
{31:7} And Moses will call to Joshua and say to him before the eyes of all Israel, Be strong and be active, for thou shalt go in with this people to the land which Jehovah sware to thy fathers to give to them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.
{31:8} And Jehovah he goes before thee; he shall be with thee; he will not relax thee, and he will not forsake thee; thou shalt not fear, and thou shalt not be dismayed.
{31:9} And Moses will write this law and will give it to the priests, the sons of Levi, lifting up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and to all the old men of Israel.
{31:10} And Moses commanded them, saying, From the end of seven years, in the appointment of the year of remission in the festival of tents,
{31:11} In the coming of all Israel to see the face of Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their ears.
{31:12} Gather the people, the men and the women and the little ones and thy stranger which is in thy gates, so that they shall hear, and so that they shall learn and fear Jehovah your God, and watch to do all the words of this law:
{31:13} And their sons which knew not shall hear and shall learn to fear Jehovah your God all the days which they lived upon the land which ye pass over Jordan there to possess it.
{31:14} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Behold thy days draw near to die: call Joshua, and stand ye in the tent of appointment, and I will command him. And Moses will go, and Joshua, and they will stand in the tent of appointment.
{31:15} And Jehovah will be seen in the tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of the cloud will stand at the door of the tent.
{31:16} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Behold thee lying down with thy fathers, and this people rising up and committing fornication after the gods of the foreigner of the land where he going there in the midst of him, and he forsook me and brake my covenant which I made with him.
{31:17} And my anger was kindled against him in that day, and I forsook them, and I hid my face from them, and he was for consuming, and many evils finding him, and afflictions, and he said in that day, Is it not because God is not in the midst of me these evils find us?
{31:18} Hiding, I will hide my face in that day for all the evils which he did, for he turned to other gods.
{31:19} And now write ye for you this song, and teach it to the sons of Israel: put it in their mouth so that this song shall be to me for a testimony among the sons of Israel.
{31:20} For I shall bring him to the land which I sware to his fathers, flowing milk and honey; and he ate and was satisfied and was fat, and turned to other gods, and they served them and despised me and brake my covenant.
{31:21} And it was when many evils and afflictions shall find him, and this song testified before him for a witness: for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouth of his seed; for I knew his formation which he did this day, before I shall bring him to the land which I sware.
{31:22} And Moses will write this song in that day, and will teach it to the sons of Israel.
{31:23} And he will command Joshua the son of Nun, and will say, Be strong and active: for thou shalt bring in the sons of Israel to the land which I sware to them, and I will be with thee.
{31:24} And it shall be when Moses finished to write the words of this law upon a book until he finished them;
{31:25} And Moses will command the Levites lifting up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying,
{31:26} Take the book of this law and put it at the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and it was there for a witness against thee.
{31:27} For I knew thy rebellion and thy hard neck: behold, in my yet living with you this day, ye were rebelling against Jehovah; and much more after my death.
{31:28} Gather to me all the old men of your tribes and your scribes, and I will speak in their ears these words, and I will take the heavens and the earth to witness against them.
{31:29} For I knew after my death that acting wickedly, ye will be corrupted, and turn aside from the way that I commanded you; and evil met you in the last of the days, for ye will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah to Make him angry in the work of your hands.
{31:30} And Moses will speak in the ears of all the gathering of Israel the words of this song till he finished them.
{32:1} Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; Thou earth shalt hear the words of my mouth.
{32:2} My doctrine shall drop as the rain; My word shall pour out as the dew, As the showers upon the herbage, And as the rains upon the green herb:
{32:3} For I will call the name of Jehovah: Give ye greatness to our God.
{32:4} The Rock, his work complete: For all his ways judgment: A God of faithfulness and not of iniquity Just and right is he.
{32:5} He acted wickedly to him; not his sons their blot: A generation perverted and crooked.
{32:6} To Jehovah will ye recompense this, A people foolish and not wise? He thy father: did he not buy thee? He made thee, and he will protect thee.
{32:7} Remember the days of eternity; Discern the years of generation and generation: Ask thy father, and he will announce to thee; Thy old men, and they shall say to thee.
{32:8} The Most High distributing the nations, In his dispersing the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the sons of Israel.
{32:9} For Jehovah the portion of his people; Jacob the cord of his inheritance.
{32:10} He will find him in the land of the desert, In a waste howling desolation: He will encompass him about; he will teach him, He will keep him as the pupil of the eye.
{32:11} As the eagle he will arouse his young brood, He will brood over his young birds; He will spread out his wings, and will take them; He will lift them up upon his wings:
{32:12} Jehovah alone will lead him, And no strange god with him.
{32:13} He will cause him to ride upon the heights of the land; He shall eat the produce of the field; And he shall suck honey from the rock, And oil from the flint of the rock.
{32:14} Curdled milk of the cow, and milk of the sheep, With the fat of lambs, And rams, sons of Bashan, and he goats, With the fat of kidneys of wheat; Thou shalt drink wine, the blood of the grape.
{32:15} And Jeshurun will be fat and will tread down: Thou wert fat, thou wert thick, thou wert covered; And he will reject God having made him, And he will despise the Rock of his deliverance.
{32:16} He will cause him to be jealous with strangers, With abominations they will irritate him.
{32:17} They will sacrifice to demons, not God; Gods they have not known them New ones came out from the midst; Your fathers not having feared them.
{32:18} Thou wilt forsake the Rock begetting thee, And thou wilt forget God setting thee free.
{32:19} And God will see and will reject, From the irritating of his sons and his daughters.
{32:20} And he will say, I will hide my face from them; I will see what shall be after them: For they a generation of perverseness, Sons no faith in them.
{32:21} They made me jealous with not God; They irritated me with their vanities: And I will make them jealous with not a people; With a foolish nation will I irritate them.
{32:22} For a fire was kindled in mine anger. And it shall burn to the lowest hades, And it shall consume the land and its produce, And it shall burn the foundations of the mountains.
{32:23} I will gather evils upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.
{32:24} Exhausted with hunger, consumed with burning, And bitter destruction: And I will send upon them the tooth of beasts, With the wrath of those crawlers of the dust.
{32:25} The sword shall bereave without, And terror from the chambers, Also the youth, also the virgin, The suckling, with the man of gray hair.
{32:26} I have said I will blow them away, I will turn away their remembrance from man;
{32:27} Unless I shall fear the enemy's their adversaries shall dissemble, Lest they shall say, Our high hand And not Jehovah did all this.
{32:28} For they a nation destroying counsels, And no understanding in them.
{32:29} Would they were wise! will they look at this? Will they discern to their latter part?
{32:30} How shall one chase a thousand; And two shall cause ten thousand to flee, If that their Rock had not sold them, And Jehovah delivered them up?
{32:31} For their rock not as our Rock, And our enemies judging.
{32:32} For their vine from the vine of Sodom, And from the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes the grapes of poverty, The clusters of bitterness to them.
{32:33} Their wine the wrath of dragons, And the fierce head of asps.
{32:34} Is not this laid up with me, Sealed up in my treasuries?
{32:35} To me vengeance and requital; At the time their foot shall waver: For the day of their destruction is near, And he hastened things prepared for them.
{32:36} For Jehovah will judge his people, And upon his servants will he have compassion; When he shall see that the hand has failed, And nothing detained and left.
{32:37} And he said, Where their gods, The rock they trusted in it?
{32:38} Whose fat of their sacrifices they shall eat; They shall drink the wine of their libations They shall rise up, and they shall succor you, It shall be for you protection.
{32:39} See ye now, that I, I am he, And no God with me: I will kill, and I will preserve alive; I struck through and through, and I will heal; And none takes away out of my hand.
{32:40} For I will lift up my hand to the heavens, And I said, I live forever.
{32:41} If I sharpened the lightning of my sword, And my hand shall lay hold upon judgment, I will turn back vengeance to mine adversaries, And to those hating me I will requite,
{32:42} I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, And my sword shall eat flesh, From the blood of the wounded and the captivity, From the head of the enemy's leaders.
{32:43} Rejoice ye nations with him, For he will raise up the blood of his servants, And he will turn back vengeance to his adversaries, And he will expiate for his land, his people.
{32:44} And Moses will come and speak all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua, son of Nun.
{32:45} And Moses will finish speaking all these words to all Israel:
{32:46} And he will say to them, Set your hearts to all the words which I call upon you to witness this day, which ye shall command your sons to watch and to do, all the words of this law.
{32:47} For it is not an empty word for you, but it is your life; and in this word ye shall prolong the days upon the land which ye pass through Jordan there to inherit it.
{32:48} And Jehovah will speak to Moses in this self-same day, saying,
{32:49} Come up to this mountain Abarim, the mountain Nebo, which is in the lend of Moab against the face of Jericho; and see the land of Canaan which I gave to the sons of Israel for a possession.
{32:50} And die in the mountain which thou earnest there, and be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount for and was gathered to his people:
{32:51} Because ye acted treacherously against me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of contradiction, of Kadesh in the desert Zin; because ye consecrated me not in the midst of the sons of Israel.
{32:52} But thou shalt see the land from before, and thou shalt not come in there to the land which I gave to the sons of Israel.
{33:1} And this the blessing which Moses the man of God praised the sons of Israel before his death.
{33:2} And he will say, Jehovah came from mount Sinai, and he rose up from Seir to them; he shone forth from mount Peran, he came from ten thousand of Kadesh; from his right hand a fire of law for them.
{33:3} Surely, he loved the peoples; all his holy ones in thy hand: they lay down at thy foot; and he will take of thy words.
{33:4} Moses commanded a law for us, the inheritance of the gathering of Jacob.
{33:5} And he will be king in Jeshurun, in the gathering the heads of the people, he united together the tribes of Israel.
{33:6} Reuben shall live and shall not die; and his men shall be of number.
{33:7} And this to Judah: and he will say, Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah, and thou wilt bring him to his people; his hands a multitude for him, and thou wilt be a help from his adversaries.
{33:8} And to Levi he said, Thy Truth and thy Light to the godly man whom they tried in the trial; thou wilt contend with him at the water of contention.
{33:9} He saying to his father and to his mother, I saw him not, and his brethren he knew not, and he knew not his sons; for they watched thy sayings and they will keep thy covenant.
{33:10} And they shall teach thy judgments to Jacob, and thy law to Israel; they will put incense at thy nose, and whole burnt-offerings upon thine altar.
{33:11} Bless, Jehovah, his strength, and thou wilt accept the work of his hands: smite through and through the loins of those rising up against him, and those hating him, lest they shall rise up.
{33:12} To Benjamin he said, The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell confidently by him; he covered over him all the day, and he dwelt between his shoulders.
{33:13} And to Joseph he said, His land from the blessing of Jehovah, from the most excellent of the heavens, from the dew and from the deep reclining beneath,
{33:14} And from the most excellent of the produce of the sun, and from the most excellent thrust forth of the moons,
{33:15} And from the head of the mountains of the beginning, and from the most excellent of the perpetual hills,
{33:16} And from the most excellent of the earth and its fulness, and the acceptance of him dwelling in the bramble: it shall come to the head of Joseph, and to the crown of the consecrated of his brethren.
{33:17} The honor to him the first-born of the bullock, his horns the horns of the unicorn: with them he will thrust the peoples together to the extremity of the earth: these the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these the thousands of Manasseh
{33:18} And to Zebulon he said, Rejoice, Zebulon, in thy going forth, and Issachar, in thy tents.
{33:19} They shall call the peoples to the mountain; there they shall sacrifice sacrifices of justice, for they shall suck the abundance of the sea, and the bidden things hid in the sand.
{33:20} And to Gad he said, Blessed he enlarging Gad: he dwelt as a lion, and he tore up the arm, also the crown.
{33:21} And he will see the first-fruits to himself, for there the portion of the ruler he covered: and he will mark out the heads of the people; he did the justice of Jehovah, and his judgments with Israel.
{33:22} And to Dan he said, Dan a lion's whelp: he shall spring forth from Bashan.
{33:23} And to Naphtali he said, Naphtali satisfied with acceptance, and filled with the blessing of Jehovah, he shall possess the sea and the south.
{33:24} And to Asher he said, Asher blessed from sons; he shall be accepted of his brethren, and he dipped his foot in oil.
{33:25} Thy bolt, iron and brass; and as thy days, thy rest.
{33:26} None as the God of Jeshurun, riding the heavens in thy help and in his lifting up the choirs.
{33:27} The God of the beginning testifying, and underneath, the perpetual arms: and he will thrust out the enemy from before thee, and will say, Destroy.
{33:28} And Israel shall dwell confidently alone; the eye of Jacob upon a land of grain and new wine, also his heavens shall drop dew.
{33:29} Happy, thou, Israel: who like thee, a people saved by Jehovah, the shield of thy help, and who the sword of thy lifting up and thine enemies will lie to thee, and thou wilt tread upon their heights.
{34:1} And Moses will go up from the desert of Moab to mount Nebo, the head of Pisgah, which is upon the face of Jericho: and Jehovah will cause him to see all the land of Gilead, even to Dan.
{34:2} And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, even to the last sea.
{34:3} And the south and the circuit in the valley of Jericho, the city of palm-trees, even to Zoar.
{34:4} And Jehovah will say to him, This the land which I sware to Abraham to Isaak and to Jacob, saying, To thy seed will I give it: I caused thee to see with thine eyes, and thou shalt not pass over there.
{34:5} And Moses the servant of Jehovah will die there in the land of Moab, at the mouth of Jehovah.
{34:6} And he will bury him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against the House of the Cleft: and no man knew his grave till this day.
{34:7} And Moses the son of a hundred and twenty years in his dying: his eye was not weak, and the freshness fled not.
{34:8} And the sons of Israel will weep for Moses in the desert of Moab thirty days: and the days of the weeping of the mourning for Moses will be finished.
{34:9} And Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom; for Moses placed his hands upon him; and the sons of Israel will hear to him, and they will do as Jehovah commanded Moses.
{34:10} And there arose not any more a prophet in Israel as Moses, whom Jehovah knew him face to face.
{34:11} According to all the signs and the wonders which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants, and to all his land;
{34:12} According to the strong hand, and according to the great fear which Moses did before the eyes of all Israel.
