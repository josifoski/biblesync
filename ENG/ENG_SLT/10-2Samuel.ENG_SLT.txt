{1:1} And it will be after the death of Saul, and David turned back from striking Amalek, and David sat down two days in Ziklag.
{1:2} And it will be in the third day, and behold, a man came from the camp from Saul, and his garments rent and dust upon his head: and it will be in his coming to David and he will fall to the earth and worship him.
{1:3} And David will say to him, From whence wilt thou come? and he will say to him, From the camp of Israel I escaped.
{1:4} And David will say to him, What was the word? announce now to me. And he will say that the people fled from the battle, and also many fell from the people, and they will die and also Saul and Jonathan his son died.
{1:5} And David will say to the youth announcing to him, How knewest thou that Saul died, and Jonathan his son?
{1:6} And the youth announcing to him, will say, And happening, I happened to be upon mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul leaning upon his spear; and behold, the chariots and lords, the horsemen, pursued him.
{1:7} And he will look behind him and see me, and he will call to me; and I say, Behold me.
{1:8} And he will say to me, Who thou? and I shall say to him, I an Amalekite.
{1:9} And he will say to me, Stand now, upon me, and kill me, for perplexity seized me because my soul is yet all in me.
{1:10} And I shall stand upon him and kill him, for I knew that he will not live after his falling: and I shall take the diadem which upon his head, and the armband which upon his arm, and I shall bring them hither to my lord.
{1:11} And David will take hold upon his garments and will rend them; and also all the men which are with him.
{1:12} And they will mourn and weep, and fast, even till the evening, for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah and for the house of Israel, because they fell by the sword.
{1:13} And David will say to the youth announcing to him, From whence thou? and he will say, I the son of a man, a stranger, an Amalekite.
{1:14} And David will say to him, How, wert thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy Jehovah's Messiah?
{1:15} And David will call to one of his youths and say, Come near, fall upon him. And he will strike him, and be will die.
{1:16} And David will say to him, Thy bloods upon thy head, for thy mouth answered against thee, saying, I killed Jehovah's Messiah.
{1:17} And David will set up this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
{1:18} (And he will say to teach the sons of Judah the bow: it was written upon the book of Jasher.)
{1:19} The beauty of Israel was wounded upon thy heights: how have the powerful fallen.
{1:20} Ye shall not announce in Gath, ye shall not announce the good news in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the rovers shall rejoice--lest the daughters of the uncircumcised shall exult.
{1:21} Mountains of Gilboa, no dew and no rain upon you, and fields of offerings: for there the shield of the powerful was cast away--the shield of Saul as not anointed with oil.
{1:22} From the blood of the wounded and from the fat of the powerful, the bow of Jonathan drew not back in the rear, and the sword of Saul will not turn back empty.
{1:23} Saul and Jonathan beloved and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not separated: they were swift above eagles, they were strong above lions.
{1:24} Daughters of Israel weep for Saul, having clothed you with scarlet, with delights; bringing up ornaments of gold upon your garments.
{1:25} How have the powerful fallen in the midst of the battle Jonathan wounded upon the heights!
{1:26} Distress to me for thee, my brother Jonathan: thou wert sweet to me exceedingly: thy love to me was wonderful above the love of women.
{1:27} How have the powerful fallen and the vessels of war perished.
{2:1} And it will be after this, and David will ask in Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah? and Jehovah will say to him, Go up. And David will say, Whither shall I go up? and he will say, To Hebron.
{2:2} And David will go up there, and also his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
{2:3} And his men which were with him David brought up with him each, and his house: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
{2:4} And the men of Judah will come and will anoint there David for king over the house of Judah. And they will announce to David, saying, The men of Jabesh-Gilead that buried Saul.
{2:5} And David will send messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead, and he will say to them, Blessed ye to Jehovah, who did this mercy with your lord, with Saul, and ye will bury him.
{2:6} And now Jehovah will do with you mercy and truth: and I also will do you this good, because ye did this word.
{2:7} And now your hands shall be strengthened, and be ye for sons of strength: for Saul your lord died, and also the house of Judah anointed me for king over them.
{2:8} And Abner, son of Ner, the chief of the army which was to Saul, took a man of shame, son a Saul, and he will cause him to pass over to Mahanaim;
{2:9} And he will make him king to Gilead, and to the Ashurite and to Jezreel, and over Ephraim and over Benjamin and over all Israel.
{2:10} The son of forty years, the man of shame, son of Saul, in his reigning over Israel; and two years he reigned: but the house of Judah was after David.
{2:11} And the number of days which David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah, will be seven years and six months.
{2:12} And Abner son of Ner, will go forth and the servants of the man of shame, son of Saul, from the two camps to the hill.
{2:13} And Joab son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, will go forth and meet them at the pool of Gibeon together: and these will sit by the pool from hence, and those by the pool from thence.
{2:14} And Abner will say to Joab, Now shall the boys arise and play before us. And Joab will say, They shall arise.
{2:15} And they will rise and pass over by number, twelve to Benjamin, and to the man of shame, son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David.
{2:16} And they will seize each upon the head of his neighbor, and his sword in the side of his neighbor, and they will fall together: and he will call, that place Helkath-Hazurim, which is in Gibeon.
{2:17} And the war will be hard even exceedingly, in that day; and Abner will be smitten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
{2:18} And there will be there three sons of Zeruiah, Joab and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was swift in his feet as one of the roes which are in the field.
{2:19} And Asahel will pursue after Abner; and he turned not to the right or to the left from after Abner.
{2:20} And Abner will look behind him and say, This thou Asahel? And he will say, I.
{2:21} And Abner will say to him. Turn to thyself to the right or to the left, and take hold for thyself from the boys and take to thee his spoils. And Asahel would not turn aside from after him.
{2:22} And Abner will add yet to say to Asahel, Turn aside for thyself from after me: wherefore shall I strike thee to the earth? and how shall I lift up my face to Joab thy brother?
{2:23} And he will refuse to turn aside: and Abner will strike him with the extremity of the spear in the belly, and the spear will come forth from behind him, and he will fall there and die in his place: and it will be, all coming to the place where Asahel fell there and he will die, and they will stand.
{2:24} And Joab and Abishai will pursue after Abner: and the sun went down and they came even to the hill of terror, which was by the face of Giah, the way of the desert of Gibeon.
{2:25} And the sons of Benjamin will gather together after Abner, and they will be for one band, and they will stand upon the head of one hill.
{2:26} And Abner will call to Joab and say, Shall the sword consume forever? knewest thou not that it will be bitter at the last? and how long wilt thou not say to the people to turn back from after their brethren?
{2:27} And Joab will say, God lives if thou spakest not, for then from the morning the people went up, each from after his brother.
{2:28} And Joab will strike upon the trumpet, and all the people will stand, and no more pursue after Israel, and they will no more add to fight.
{2:29} And Abner and his men went in the sterile region all that night, and they will pass over Jordan and will go to all Bithron, and will come to the two camps.
{2:30} And Joab turned back from after Abner: and he will gather all the people together and they will review from the servants of David nineteen men and Asahel.
{2:31} And the servants of David struck from Benjamin and upon the men of Abner, three hundred and sixty men died.
{2:32} And they will lift up Asahel and bury him in the grave of his father, which was in the House of Bread. And Joab and his men will go all night and it will shine to them in Hebron.
{3:1} And long war will be between the house of Saul and between the house of David: and David went and was strengthened, and the house of Saul went and was weakened.
{3:2} And sons will be born to David in Hebron: and his firstborn will be Amnon to Ahinoam the Jezreelitess.
{3:3} And his second, Chileab, to Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom, son of Maacah, daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur.
{3:4} And the fourth, Adonijah, son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah, the son of Abital.
{3:5} And the sixth, Ithream, to Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
{3:6} And it will be in there being war between the house of Saul and between the house of David, and Abner was strong for the house of Saul.
{3:7} And to Saul a concubine, and her name Rizpah, daughter of Aiah: and he will say to Abner, Wherefore wentest thou in to my father's concubine?
{3:8} And it will kindle to Abner greatly for the words of the man of shame, and he will say, Am I the head of a dog which against Judah this day will do mercy with the house of Saul thy father to his brethren and to his friends, and not delivering thee into the hand of David, and thou wilt review over me concerning the woman this day?
{3:9} Thus will God do to Abner, and thus will he add to him, for as Jehovah sware to David that thus I will do to him:
{3:10} To cause the kingdom to pass over from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan and even to the Well of the Oath.
{3:11} And he was not able to turn back Abner a word from his fearing him.
{3:12} And Abner will send messengers to David for his sake, saying, To whom the land? saying, Cut out thy covenant with me, and behold, my hand with thee to turn about to thee all Israel.
{3:13} And he will say, Good; I will cut out with thee a covenant: but one word I ask from thee, saying, Thou shalt not see my face if before thy bringing Michal, Saul's daughter, in thy coming to see my face.
{3:14} And David will send messengers to the man of shame, son of Saul, saying, Thou shalt give my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred uncircumcisions of the rovers.
{3:15} And the man of shame will send and take her from the man Phaltiel, son of Laish.
{3:16} And her husband went with her, going and weeping after her even to Bahurim. And Abner will say to him, Go, turn back And he will turn back.
{3:17} And a word of Abner was with the old men of Israel, saying, Also yesterday also the third day ye were seeking David for king over you.
{3:18} And now do; for Jehovah said to David, saying, By the hand of David my servant I saved my people from the hand of the rovers, and from the hand of all their enemies.
{3:19} And Abner will speak also in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner will also go to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all which was good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of all the house of Benjamin.
{3:20} And Abner will come to David to Hebron, and with him twenty men: and David will make to Abner and to the men with him a drinking.
{3:21} And Abner will say to David, I will arise and go and gather to my lord the king, all Israel, and they shall cut out with thee a covenant, and thou didst reign over all that thy soul shall desire. And David will send away Abner, and he will go in peace.
{3:22} And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from the troop, and they brought with them much spoil: and Abner not with David in Hebron, for he sent him away, and he went in peace.
{3:23} And Joab and all the army which was with him came, and they will announce to Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he will send him away, and he will go in peace.
{3:24} And Joab will come to the king and he will say, What didst thou? behold, Abner came to thee; wherefore this thou sentest him away, and going, he went?
{3:25} Thou knewest Abner son of Ner, for to deceive thee he came, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all which thou doest.
{3:26} And Joab will go forth from David and send messengers after Abner, and they will turn him back from the Well of Sirah: and David knew not.
{3:27} And Abner will turn back to Hebron, and Joab will turn him away to the midst of the gate to speak with him in quiet, and he will strike him there in the belly, and he will die for the blood of Asahel his brother.
{3:28} And David will hear from after this, and he will say, I am innocent, and my kingdom, with Jehovah even forever, from the bloods of Abner son of Ner.
{3:29} It will stay upon the head of Joab and to all the house of his father; and there shall not be cut off from the house of Joab, him flowing, and the leprous, and him holding fast upon a staff, and him falling upon a sword, and him diminished in bread.
{3:30} And Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner because be slew Asahel their brother in Gibeon in war.
{3:31} And David will say to Joab and to all the people which were with him, Rend your garments and gird you with sack-cloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David went after the litter.
{3:32} And they will bury Abner in Hebron: and the king will lift up his voice and weep at the grave of Abner; and all the people will weep.
{3:33} And the king will lament for Abner, and he will say, As the fool died will Abner die?
{3:34} Thy hands not bound, and thy feet were not joined to fetters as falling before the sons of iniquity thou fellest. And all the people will add to weep over him.
{3:35} And all the people will come to cause David to eat bread, while yet day. And David will swear, saying, Thus will God do to me, and thus will he add, if before the going down of the sun I shall taste bread or anything.
{3:36} And all the people knew, and it will be good in their eyes, as all the king did was good in the eyes of all the people.
{3:37} And all the people knew, and all Israel, in that day, that it was not from the king to kill Abner son of Ner.
{3:38} And the king will say to his servants, Will ye not know that a chief and a great one fell this day in Israel?
{3:39} And I this day tender, and being anointed king; and these men sons of Zeruiah, hard for me. Jehovah will recompense to him doing evil according to his evil.
{4:1} And Saul's son will hear that Abner died in Hebron, and his hands will be relaxed, and all Israel trembled.
{4:2} And two men, chiefs of troops, were to the son of Saul: the name of the one, Baanah, and the name of the second, Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin, for also Beeroth was reckoned to Benjamin.
{4:3} And the Beerothites will flee to Gittaim, and they will be sojourners there till this day.
{4:4} And to Jonathan, Saul's son, a son smitten in the feet: he was the son of five years in the news coming of Saul and Jonathan from Jezreel, and his nurse will lift him up and flee: and it will be in her springing up to flee, and he will fall, and he will be lame: and his name Mephibosheth.
{4:5} And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, will go, and they will come about the heat of the day to the house of the man of shame; and he lay down upon the bed at noon.
{4:6} And behold, they came even to the midst of the house, taking wheat; and they will strike him in the belly; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
{4:7} And they will come to the house, and he will lie upon his couch in his bed-chamber, and they will strike him and kill him, and take away his head, and they will take his head and go the way of the sterile region all night.
{4:8} And they will bring the head of the man of shame to David to Hebron, and they will say to the king, Behold the head of the man of shame, son of Saul thine enemy, who sought thy soul; and Jehovah will give to my lord the king vengeance this day of Saul and of his seed.
{4:9} And David will answer Rechab and Baanah his brother, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and he will say to them, Jehovah lives who redeemed my soul from all straits,
{4:10} When he announcing to me, saying, Behold, Saul died; and he was in his eyes as announcing good news; and I shall seize upon him and kill him in Ziklag, which I gave to him for the good news:
{4:11} Much more when wicked men killed a just man in his house upon his bed; and now shall I not seek out his blood from your hand and take you away from the earth?
{4:12} And David will command the boys and they will kill them and cut off their hands and their feet, and hang them over the pain Hebron. And the head of Ishbosheth they took and they will bury it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
{5:1} And all the tribes of Israel will come to David to Hebron, and they will say, saying, Behold us thy bone and thy flesh.
{5:2} Also yesterday, also the third day, in Saul being king over us, thou wert bringing out and bringing in Israel And Jehovah will say to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be for leader over Israel.
{5:3} And all the old men of Israel will come to the king to Hebron; and king David will cut out for them a covenant in Hebron before Jehovah, and they will anoint David for king over Israel.
{5:4} The son of thirty years was David in his reigning, and he reigned forty years.
{5:5} In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
{5:6} And the king went, and his men, to Jerusalem to the Jebusite dwelling in the land: and he will say to David, saying, Thou shalt not come here for except thy taking away the blind and the lame, saying, David shall not come in hither.
{5:7} And David will take the fastness of Zion: this the city of David.
{5:8} And David will say in that day, Every one striking the Jebusite, and shall reach upon the cataract, and the lame and the blind hating David's soul; for this they will say, The blind and the lame shall not come in to the house.
{5:9} And David will dwell in the fastness, and he will call it the city of David. And David will build round about from Millo and its house.
{5:10} And David went, going, and was great, and Jehovah God of armies with him.
{5:11} And Hiram, king of Tyre, will send messengers to David, and wood of cedars and artificers of wood, and artificers of stone of the wall: and they will build a house for David.
{5:12} And David knew that Jehovah prepared him for king over Israel, and that he lifted up his kingdom for sake of his people Israel.
{5:13} And David will take yet concubines and wives from Jerusalem after his coming from Hebron, and there will be yet born to David sons and daughters.
{5:14} And these the names of those born to him in Jerusalem: Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
{5:15} And Ibhar and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
{5:16} And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.
{5:17} And the rovers will hear that they anointed David for king over Israel, and all the rovers will come up to seek David; and David will hear and he will go down to the fastness.
{5:18} And the rovers came and they will be dispersed in the valley of Rephaim.
{5:19} And David will ask in Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the rovers? wilt thou give them into my hand? and Jehovah will say to David, Go up: for giving, I will give the rovers into thy hand.
{5:20} And David will come against the Lord of Breaches, and David will strike them there, and he will say, Jehovah broke down mine enemies before me as the breach of waters: for this he called the name of that place, the Lord of the Breaches.
{5:21} And they will leave there their images, and David and his men will take them away.
{5:22} And the rovers will add yet to come up, and they will be dispersed in the valley of Rephaim.
{5:23} And David will ask in God, and he will say, Thou shalt not go up: turn about behind them and thou shalt cover against them from before the weepings.
{5:24} And it shall be in thy hearing the voice of the going in the heads of the weepings, then thou shalt be active, for then Jehovah will go forth before thee to strike upon the camp of the rovers.
{5:25} And David will do thus as Jehovah commanded him, and he will strike the rovers from Geba even to thy coming to Gazer.
{6:1} And David will yet gather together all the chosen in Israel, thirty thousand.
{6:2} And David will rise and go and all the people which were with him from the lords of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God which the name was called the name of Jehovah of armies sitting the cherubims over it.
{6:3} And they caused the ark of God to ride upon a new wagon, and they will lift it up from the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill: and Uzzah and his brother, sons of Abinadab, led the new wagon.
{6:4} And they will lift it up from the house of Abinadab, which is in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.
{6:5} And David and all the house of Israel playing before Jehovah upon all cypress woods, and upon harps, and upon lyres and upon drums, and upon timbrels and upon cymbals.
{6:6} And they will come to the threshing-floor of Nachon, and Uzzah will stretch forth to the ark of God and lay hold upon its for the oxen kicked.
{6:7} And the anger of Jehovah will kindle against Uzzah, and God will strike him there for the error, and he will die there with the ark of God.
{6:8} And it will kindle to David because Jehovah broke a breach upon Uzzah: and he will call that place the Breach of Uzzah, even to this day.
{6:9} And David was afraid of Jehovah in that day, and he will say, How shall the ark of Jehovah come to me?
{6:10} And David would not remove to him the ark of Jehovah to the city of David: and David will turn it to the house of the servant of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
{6:11} And the ark of Jehovah will dwell in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months: and Jehovah will bless Obed-Edom and all his house.
{6:12} And it will be announced to king David, saying, Jehovah blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all which is to him, on account of the ark of God. And David will go and bring up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the city of David with joy.
{6:13} And it will be when they lifting up the ark of Jehovah went six steps, and he will sacrifice oxen and fat things.
{6:14} And David leaping with all strength before Jehovah: and David was girded with a linen ephod.
{6:15} And David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of Jehovah with shouts and with the voice of the trumpet,
{6:16} And the ark of Jehovah was coming to the city of David, and Michal, Saul's daughter, looked forth without the window, and she will see king David being strengthened and leaping before Jehovah, and she will despise him in her heart.
{6:17} And they will bring in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place in the midst of the tent which David stretched out for it: and David will bring up a burnt-offering before Jehovah and peace.
{6:18} And David will finish bringing up the burnt-offering and the peace, and he will bless the people in the name of Jehovah of armies.
{6:19} And he will distribute to all the people to every sort of Israel, from man and even to woman, to each one cake of bread, and one measure, and one cake: and all the people will go each to his house.
{6:20} And David turned back to bless his house. And Michal, Saul's daughter, will go forth to the meeting of David, and she will say, How honored the king of Israel this day who was uncovered this day to the eyes of the maids of his servants as one of the worthless uncovering was uncovered!
{6:21} And David will say to Michal, Before Jehovah who chose in me above thy father and above all his house, to appoint me leader over the people of Jehovah, over Israel: and I played before Jehovah.
{6:22} And I was vile yet above this and I was humbled in mine eyes, and with the maids of which thou spakest with them I shall be honored.
{6:23} And to Michal, Saul's daughter, there was no child to her even to the day of her death.
{7:1} And it will be when the king sat in his house, and Jehovah gave rest to him from round about from all his enemies.
{7:2} And the king will say to Nathan the prophet, See now, me dwelling in a house of cedars, and the ark of God dwelling in midst of the curtains.
{7:3} And Nathan will say to the king, All which, is in thy heart, do; for Jehovah is with thee.
{7:4} And it will be in that night, and the word of Jehovah will be to Nathan, saying,
{7:5} Go and say to my servant, to David, Thus said Jehovah, Shalt thou build me an house for my resting?
{7:6} For I dwelt not in a house from the day I brought up the sons of Israel from Egypt even to this day, and I shall be going in a tent and in a dwelling.
{7:7} And in all where I went among all the sons of Israel spake I a word with one of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why built ye not to me a house of cedars?
{7:8} And now thus shalt thou say to my servant, to David, Thus said Jehovah of armies, I took thee from quiet, from after the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:
{7:9} And I will be with thee in all where thou wilt go, and I will cut off all thine enemies from thy face, and I made to thee a great name as the name of the great which are upon the earth.
{7:10} And I set a place for my people, for Israel, and I planted him and he dwelt in his place, and he shall be no more moved; and the sons of iniquity shall not add to humble him as in the beginning.
{7:11} And from the day I commanded judges over my people Israel, and I gave rest to thee from all thine enemies. And Jehovah announced to thee that Jehovah will make to thee a house.
{7:12} When thy days shall be filled up and thou shalt lie down with thy fathers, and I raised up thy seed after thee which shall come forth thy bowels, and I prepared his kingdom.
{7:13} He shall build a house for my name, and I set the throne of his kingdom even to forever.
{7:14} I will be to him for father, and he shall be to me for son; who in his sinning I struck him with the rod of men, and with the blows of the sons of men.
{7:15} And my mercy I will not remove from him as I removed from Saul whom I removed from thy face.
{7:16} And thy house was firm and thy kingdom even to forever before thee; thy throne shall be prepared even to forever.
{7:17} According to all these words and according to all this vision so spake Nathan to David.
{7:18} And king David will come and sit before Jehovah, and say, Who am I Lord Jehovah? and who my house that thou broughtest me even to these?
{7:19} And this yet will be small in thine eyes, Lord Jehovah; and thou wilt speak also to the house of thy servant for remoteness. And this the law of man, Lord Jehovah?
{7:20} And what shall David yet add to speak to thee? for thou knewest thy servant, Lord Jehovah.
{7:21} For sake of thy word and according to thy heart thou didst all this greatness to make thy servant know.
{7:22} For this thou wert great, Jehovah God: for none as thee, for no God beside thee according to all we heard in our ears.
{7:23} And who as thy people, as Israel, one nation in the earth whom God went to redeem to him for a people, and to set up for him a name, and to do for you greatness and wonderful things for thy land from the face of thy people whom thou didst redeem to thee from Egypt, nations and his tents.
{7:24} And thou wilt prepare to thyself thy people Israel to thee for a people, even to forever. And thou Jehovah wert to them for God.
{7:25} And now, Jehovah God the word that thou spakest concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, set up even to forever, and do as thou spakest.
{7:26} And thy name shall be great even to forever, saying, Jehovah of armies the God over Israel: and the house of thy servant David shall be prepared before thee.
{7:27} For thou, Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, thou didst open the ear of thy servant, saying, I will build to thee an house: for this thy servant found his heart to pray to thee this prayer.
{7:28} And now, Lord Jehovah, thou that God, and thy words shall be true, and thou wilt speak to thy servant this goodness.
{7:29} And now be willing and bless the house of thy servant to be forever before thee: for thou, Lord Jehovah, spakest: and from thy blessing the house of thy servant shall be blessed forever.
{8:1} And it will be after this, and David will strike the rovers and subdue them: and David will take the bridle of the metropolis out of the hand of the rovers.
{8:2} And he will smite Moab, and measure them with a cord, laying them down upon the earth; and he will measure with two cords to put to death, and a full cord to save alive. And Moab will be to David for servants, lifting up gifts.

{8:11} Also king David consecrated them to Jehovah with the silver and the gold, which he consecrated from all the nations which he subdued:
{8:12} From Aram, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, and from the rovers, and from Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
{8:13} And David will make a name in his turning back from his smiting Aram in the valley of salt, eighteen thousand.
{8:14} And he will put garrisons in Edom; in all Edom he put garrisons, and all Edom will be servants to David. And Jehovah will save David in all which he went.

{9:1} And David will say, Is there yet any which was left to the house of Saul? and I will do with him mercy for sake of Jonathan.
{9:2} And to the house of Saul a servant and his name Ziba. And they will call for him to David, and the king will say to him, Thou Ziba? and he will say, Thy servant.
{9:3} And the king will say, Is there not yet a man to the house of Saul? and I will do with him the mercy of God. And Ziba will say to the king, Yet a son to Jonathan, smitten of the feet.
{9:4} And the king will say to him, Where is he? And Ziba will say to the king, Behold him in the house of Machir, son of Ammiel, from Lo-Debar.
{9:5} And king David will send and take him from the house of Machir, son of Ammiel, from Lo-Debar.
{9:6} And Mephibosheth, son of Jonathan, son of Saul, will come to David and fall upon his face and worship him. And David will say, Mephibosheth. And he will say, Behold thy servant.
{9:7} And David will say to him, Thou shalt not fear, for doing, I will do with thee mercy for sake of Jonathan thy father; and I turned back to thee all the field of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread upon my table always.
{9:8} And he will worship him and say, What is thy servant that thou didst look to a dead dog which is like me?
{9:9} And the king will call for Ziba the boy of Saul, and say to him, All which was to Saul and to all his house I gave to the son of thy lord.
{9:10} And work for him the land, thou and thy sons, and thy servants, and bring in and it being bread for the son of thy lord, and they shall eat: and Mephibosheth, son of thy lord, shall eat always bread upon my table. And to Ziba, fifteen sons and twenty servants.
{9:11} And Ziba will say to the king, According to all which my lord the king will command, so will thy servant do. And Mephibosheth ate at my table as one of the sons of the king.
{9:12} And to Mephibosheth a little son, and his name Micha And all dwelling in the house of Ziba, servants to Mephibosheth.
{9:13} And Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for at the king's table be always ate; and he was lame in his two feet.
{10:1} And it will be after this, and the king of the sons of Ammon will die, and Hanun his son will reign in his stead.
{10:2} And David will say, I will do mercy with Hanun son of Nahash, as his father did mercy with me. And David will send to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants will come to the land of the sons of Ammon.
{10:3} And the chiefs of the sons of Ammon will say to Hanun their lord, Is David honoring thy father in thine eyes, that he sent comforters to thee? is it not for the sake of searching out the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it, David sent his servants to thee?
{10:4} And Hanun will take David's servants, and shave half their beard, and cut off their garments in the half, even to their buttocks, and he will send them away.
{10:5} And they will announce to David, and he will send to meet them, for the men were greatly shamed. And the king will say, Sit down in Jericho till your beards spring up, and turn back.
{10:6} And the sons of Ammon will see that they became loathsome before David, and the sons of Ammon will send and hire Aram of the house of Rehob, and Aram of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and king Maacah a thousand men, and Ish-Tob two thousand men.
{10:7} And David will bear, and he will send Joab and all the army of the strong.
{10:8} And the sons of Ammon will go forth and they will arrange the battle at the opening of the gate: and Aram of Zobah and Rehob and Ish-Tob, and Maacah by themselves in the field.
{10:9} And Joab will see that the face of the battle was against him from before and from behind, and he will choose from all the chosen in Israel and will arrange for the meeting of Aram:
{10:10} And the remainder of the people he gave into the hand of Abishai his brother, and he will arrange to meet the sons of Ammon.
{10:11} And he will say, If Aram shall be strong above me, and be thou to me for deliverance: and if the sons of Ammon shall be strong above thee, and I came for deliverance to thee.
{10:12} Be strong, and we will be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah shall do the good in his eyes.
{10:13} And Joab will draw near, and the people which were with him, to battle against Aram: and they will flee from his face.
{10:14} And the sons of Ammon saw that Aram fled and they will flee from the face of Abishai, and come into the city. And Joab will turn back from the sons of Ammon and come to Jerusalem.
{10:15} And Aram will see that he was smitten before Israel, and they will be gathered together.
{10:16} And Hadadezer will send and will bring forth Aram that was beyond the river: and they will come to Helam and Shobach, chief of the army of Hadadezer, before them.
{10:17} And it will be announced to David, and he will gather together all Israel, and he will pass over Jordan and will come to Helam. And Aram will arrange to meet David, and they will war with him.
{10:18} And Aram will flee from the face of Israel; and David will kill from Aram seven hundred chariots and forty thousand horsemen, and Shobach chief of his army he struck, and he will die there.
{10:19} And all the kings, servants of Hadadezer, will see that they were smitten before Israel, and they will be at peace with Israel, and serve them. And Aram will be afraid yet to save the sons of Ammon.
{11:1} And it will be at the return of the year, at the time of the going forth of kings, and David will send Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they will destroy the sons of Ammon, and they will watch closely against Rabbah And David will dwell in Jerusalem.
{11:2} And it will be at the time of the evening, and David will rise from off his bed, and will go upon the roof of the king's house: and he will see from the roof a woman washing herself; and the woman good of aspect exceedingly.
{11:3} And David will send and seek for the woman, and say, Is not this Bath-Sheba, daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
{11:4} And David will send messengers and take her: and she will come in to him, and he will lie with her; (and she being consecrated from her uncleanness:) and she will turn back to her house.
{11:5} And the woman will conceive, and send and announce to David, and say, I am pregnant.
{11:6} And David will send to Joab, Send to me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab will send Uriah to David.
{11:7} And Uriah will come to him, and David will ask for peace of Joab, and for the peace of the people, and for the peace of the host.
{11:8} And David will say to Uriah, Go down to thy house and wash thy feet And Uriah will go forth from the house of the king and a loan of the king will go forth after him.
{11:9} And Uriah will lie at the door of the house of the king with all the servants of his lord, and will not go down to his house.
{11:10} And they will announce to David, saying Uriah went not down to his house; and David will say to Uriah, Camest thou not from the way? wherefore wentest thou not down to thy house?
{11:11} And Uriah will say to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, dwell in tents; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamping upon the face of the field; and shall I come into my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? Thee living and thy soul living, if I shall do this word.
{11:12} And David will say to Uriah, Dwell here also this day, and to-morrow I will send thee away. And Uriah dwelt in Jerusalem in that day and from the morrow.
{11:13} And David will call for him, and he will eat before him and drink; and he will make him drunk: and he will go forth in the evening to lie upon his bed with the servants of his lord; and he will not go down to his house.
{11:14} And it will be in the morning, and David will write a letter to Joab, and send by the hand of Uriah.
{11:15} And he will write in the letter: saying, Bring in Uriah to the front of the face of the strong battle, and turn ye back from after him, and he shall be smitten and die.
{11:16} And it will be in Joab's watching the city, and he will give Uriah to the place where he knew that strong men were there.
{11:17} And the men of the city will go forth and fight with Joab: and there will fall of the people from the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite also will die.
{11:18} And Joab will send and announce to David all the words of the war;
{11:19} And be will command the messenger, saying, When thou finishest all the words of the war to speak to the king,
{11:20} And it being if the wrath of the king shall go up, and he say to thee, Wherefore drew ye near to the city to fight? did ye not know that they cast from above the wall?
{11:21} Who struck Abimelech, son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast upon him a piece of the upper millstone from above the wall, and he will die in Thebez? Wherefore drew ye near to the wall? And say thou, Also thy servant, Uriah the Hittite died.
{11:22} And the messenger will go, and come and announce to David all that for which Joab sent him.
{11:23} And the messenger will say to David, That the men were strengthened upon us, and they came out to us to the field, and they were upon them, even to the door of the gate.
{11:24} And they beholding, aimed at thy servants from above the wall: and from the servants of the king will die, and also thy servant, Uriah the Hittite died.
{11:25} And David will say to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, This same word shall not be evil in thine eyes, as this, and as this, the sword shall consume: strengthen thy battle against the city and pull it down: and strengthen yourselves.
{11:26} And Uriah's wife will hear that Uriah her husband died, and she will mourn for her lord.
{11:27} And the mourning will pass over, and David will send and take her to his house, and she will be to him for wife, and bear to him a son. And the word which David did will be evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
{12:1} And Jehovah will send Nathan to David. And he will come in to him and say to him, Two men were in one city; one rich and one poor.
{12:2} To the rich was sheep and oxen exceeding many:
{12:3} And to the poor, not anything except one little ewe lamb which he found, and he will save it alive: and it will grow with him and with his sons together; it will eat from his morsel and will drink from his cup, and will lie in his bosom, and be to him as a daughter.
{12:4} And a traveler will come to the rich man, and he will spare to take from his sheep and from his oxen to do for the wayfarer coming to him; and he will take the poor man's ewe lamb and do for the man coming to him.
{12:5} And David's anger will kindle against the man greatly, and he will say to Nathan, Jehovah lives, for the man doing this is the son of death.
{12:6} And the ewe lamb he shall requite four-fold, because he did this word, and because he spared not.
{12:7} And Nathan will say to David, Thou the man. Thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, I anointed thee for king over Israel, and I delivered thee from the hand of Saul;
{12:8} And I will give thee the house of thy lord and thy lord's wives into thy bosom, and I will give to thee the house of Israel and Judah; and if little, I will add to thee according to these and according to these.
{12:9} Wherefore didst thou despise the word of Jehovah to do evil in his eyes? Uriah the Hittite thou didst strike with the sword, and his wife thou tookest to thee for a wife, and thou didst kill him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.
{12:10} And now the sword shall not depart from thy house even to forever; because that thou didst despise me, and thou wilt take the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be to thee for wife.
{12:11} Thus said Jehovah, Behold me raising up evil against thee from thy house, and I took thy wives before thine eyes and gave to thy neighbor, and he lay with thy wives before the eyes of this sun.
{12:12} For thou didst in secret: and I will do this word before all Israel, and before the sun.
{12:13} And David will say to Nathan, I sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan will say to David, Jehovah also passed over thy sin; thou shalt not die.
{12:14} Only that despising, thou didst cause the enemies of Jehovah to despise by this thing, also the son born to thee, dying, shall die.
{12:15} And Nathan will go to his house. And Jehovah will strike the child which Uriah's wife bare to David and he will be sick.
{12:16} And David will seek God for the boy, and fast a fast; and he came and passed the night and lay upon the earth.
{12:17} And the old men of his house will rise to him to lift him up from the earth; and he would not, and he ate not bread with them.
{12:18} And it will be in the seventh day, and the child will die. And David's servants feared to announce to him that the child died: for they said, Behold, in the child being living we spake to him and he heard not to our voice, and how shall we say to him the child died, and do evil?
{12:19} And David will see that his servants are whispering, and David will perceive that the child died: and David will say to his servants, Did the child die? and they will say, He died.
{12:20} And David will rise from the earth and wash, and be anointed, and he will change his garments, and will go into the house of Jehovah and worship, and go to his house; and he will ask and they will set bread to him, and he will eat.
{12:21} And his servants will say to him, What this word which thou didst? for sake of the child living thou didst fast and weep, and when the child died thou didst rise and thou wilt eat bread.
{12:22} And he will say, The child yet living, and I fasted and wept; for I said, Who will know Jehovah will compassionate me, and the child live?
{12:23} And now he died, wherefore thus do I fast? shall I be able to yet turn him back? I go to him, and he will not turn back to me.
{12:24} And David will comfort Bath-Sheba his wife, and will go in to her and lie with her, and she will bear a son, and he will call his name Solomon: and Jehovah loved him.
{12:25} And he will send by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he will call his name Jedidiah, for sake of Jehovah.
{12:26} And Joab will fight against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and he will take the city of the kingdom.
{12:27} And Joab will send messengers to David, and say, I fought against Rabbah, also I took the city of waters.
{12:28} And now gather together the rest of the people and encamp against the city, and take it, lest I shall take the city, and my name was called upon it.
{12:29} And David will gather all the people together and go to Rabbah, and war against it and take it.
{12:30} And he will take the crown of their king from his head; and its weight a talent of gold and a precious stone; and it will be upon David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city exceeding much.
{12:31} And the people which were in it he brought forth, and he will put at the saw and at the threshing-sledge of iron, and at axes of iron, and caused them to pass over through the brick-kiln: and thus he will do to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David will turn back, and all the people, to Jerusalem.
{13:1} And it will be after this, and to Absalom son of David a fair sister, and her name Tamar; and Amnon, son of David, loved her.
{13:2} And Amnon will be pressed to be sick for sake of Tamar his sister, for she was a virgin; and it will be hard in the eyes of Amnon to do anything to her.
{13:3} And to Amnon a friend, and his name Jonadab, son of Shimeah, David's brother: and Jonadab a man exceeding wise.
{13:4} And he will say to him, Wherefore thou so weak, son of the king, in morning by morning? wilt thou not announce to me? and Amnon will say to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
{13:5} And Jonadab will say to him, Lie upon thy bed and be sick, and thy father coming to see thee, and say to him, Now my sister Tamar shall come and give me to eat bread and make the food before mine eyes, so that I shall see and eat from her hand.
{13:6} And Amnon will lie down and be sick: and the king will come to see him, and Amnon will say to the king, Will Tamar my sister come now, and she shall make before mine eyes two cakes, and I will eat from her hand.
{13:7} And David will send to Tamar, saying, Go now to the house of Amnon thy brother, and make food for him.
{13:8} And Tamar will go to the house of Amnon her brother, and he lay down. And she will take dough and knead, and make cakes before his eyes, and bake the cakes.
{13:9} And she will take a frying-pan and pour out before him; and he will refuse to eat. And Amnon will say, Bring out every man from me. And they brought forth every man from him.
{13:10} And Amnon will say to Tamar, Bring the cakes into the chamber, and I will eat from thine hand And Tamar will take the cakes which she made and bring to Amnon her brother into the chamber.
{13:11} And she will bring near to him to eat, and he will lay hold upon her and say, Come lie with me, my sister.
{13:12} And she will say to him, No, my brother, thou shalt not humble me; for so it shall not be done in Israel: thou shalt not do this folly.
{13:13} And I, whither shall I cause my reproach to go? and thou wilt be as one of the foolish in Israel. And now, speak now, to the king, and he will not withhold me from thee.
{13:14} And he would not hear to her voice; and he will be strong above her, and he will humble her and lie with her.
{13:15} And Amnon will hate her with great hatred, greatly; for great the hatred which he hated her above the love which he loved her. And Amnon will say to her, Arise, go.
{13:16} And she will say to him, No reasons: this evil great above the other which thou didst with me, to send me away. And he would not hear to her.
{13:17} And he will call his boy serving him, and say, Send away now this from me without, and fasten the door after her.
{13:18} And upon her a tunic reaching to the soles of the feet; for thus will the king's daughters, the virgins, be clothed with upper garments. And his attendant will bring her forth without, and he fastened the door after.
{13:19} And Tamar will take ashes upon her head, and she rent the tunic reaching to the feet which was upon her, and she will put her hand upon her head and will go, going and crying.
{13:20} And Absalom her brother will say to her Was Amnon thy brother with thee? and now my sister be silent, he is thy brother; thou shalt not set thy heart to this word. And Tamar will remain, and she was desolate in the house of Absalom her brother.
{13:21} And king David heard all the words and it will kindle to him greatly.
{13:22} And Absalom spake not with Amnon, from evil and even to good: for Absalom hated Amnon for the word that he humbled Tamar his sister.
{13:23} And it will be for two years of days, and shearers will be to Absalom in Baal-Hazor, which is with Ephraim: and Absalom will call for all the king's sons.
{13:24} And Absalom will come to the king and say, Behold now, shearers to thy servant: now will the king go, and his servants, with thy servant?
{13:25} And the king will say to Absalom, No, my son, not now will we all go, and we will not be heavy upon thee. And he will press upon him, and he would not go, and he will bless him.
{13:26} And Absalom will say, And shall not Amnon my brother now go with us? And the king will say to him, Wherefore shall he go with thee?
{13:27} And Absalom will press upon him, and he will send with him Amnon and all the king's sons.
{13:28} And Absalom will command his boys, saying, See now, when the heart of Amnon is good with wine, and I said to you, Strike Amnon; and kill him; ye shall not be afraid, for I commanded you: be strong and be for sons of strength.
{13:29} And Absalom's boys will do to Amnon as Absalom commanded. And all the king's sons will rise up and ride each upon his mule and flee.
{13:30} And it will be they in the way, and the report came to David saying, Absalom struck all the king's sons and not one remaining of them.
{13:31} And the king will rise and rend his garments, and will lie down upon the earth; and all his servants standing by with their garments rent.
{13:32} And Jonadab, son of Shimeah, David's brother, will answer and say, My lord shall not say, All the boys, the king's sons, were slain; for Amnon alone died; for by the mouth of Absalom it was set from the day he humbled Tamar his sister.
{13:33} And now my lord the king shall not set to his heart the word, saying, All the king's sons died; for only Amnon alone died.
{13:34} And Absalom will flee. And the boy watching will lift up his eyes and see, and behold, much people coming from the way behind him from the side of the mountain.
{13:35} And Jonadab will say to the king, Behold, the king's sons came; as thy servant spake, so it was.
{13:36} And it will be as he finished to speak, and behold, the king's sons came, and they will lift up their voice and weep: and the king and all his servants wept a very great weeping.
{13:37} And Absalom fled and went to Talmai, son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And he will mourn for his son all the days.
{13:38} And Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and he will be there three years.
{13:39} And David the king was fixed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted for Amnon, for he died.
{14:1} And Joab son of Zeruiah, knew that the king's heart was for Absalom.
{14:2} And Joab will send to Tekoah and take from thence a wise woman, and he will say to her, Thou shalt mourn, and put on now garments of mourning, and thou shalt not be anointed with oil, and be thou as a woman this many days mourning for the dead:
{14:3} And come to the king and speak to him according to this word. And Joab will put words in her mouth.
{14:4} And the woman, the Tekoite, will speak to the king and fall upon her face to the earth, and worship him, and say, Save, O king!
{14:5} And the king will say to her, What to thee? And she will say, Truly I a widow woman, and my husband will die.
{14:6} And to thy servant two sons, and they two will strive in the field, and none delivering between them; and the one will smite the one and kill him.
{14:7} And behold, all the family rose up against thy servant, and they will say, Give him striking his brother and we will kill him for the soul of his brother whom he slew; and they destroyed also the heir, and quenched my coal which was left, so that name was not set to my husband and remainder upon the face of the earth.
{14:8} And the king will say to the woman, Go to thy house and I will command concerning thee.
{14:9} And the woman, the Tekoite, will say to the king, Upon me, my lord the king, the iniquity, and upon my father's house: and the king and his throne innocent.
{14:10} And the king will say, Who speaking to thee and bring him to me and he shall not add to touch upon thee.
{14:11} And she will say, The king will remember now, Jehovah thy God, the nearest relation of blood being multiplied to destroy, and they shall not destroy my son. And he will say, Jehovah living, if there shall fall from the hair of thy son to the earth.
{14:12} And the woman will say, Shall thy servant speak now a word to my lord the king? And the king will say, Speak.
{14:13} And the woman will say, And wherefore didst thou reckon according to this concerning the people of God? for the king speaks this word as transgressing for the king not to turn back his fugitive.
{14:14} For dying, we shall die, and as waters poured out on the earth, which will not be gathered; and God will not lift up the soul: and reckoning, he reckons that the fugitive shall not be driven out from him.
{14:15} And now that I came to speak to the king my lord, this word, for the people will see me, and thy servant will say, I will speak now to the king, perhaps the king will do the word of his servant.
{14:16} For the king will hear to deliver his servant from the band of the man destroying me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
{14:17} And thy servant will say, Now will the word of my lord the king be for a sacrifice, for as a messenger of God, so my lord the king to hear the good and the evil: and Jehovah thy God will be with thee.
{14:18} And the king will answer and say to the woman, Now thou shalt not hide from me the word which I ask thee. And the woman will say, Now will my lord the king speak?
{14:19} And the king will say, The hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman will answer and say, Thy soul living, my lord the king, if there is to the right or to the left from all which my lord the king spake: for thy servant Joab he commanded me, and he put in the mouth of thy servant all these words.
{14:20} For the sake of turning about the face of the word, thy servant Joab did this word: and my lord was wise according to the wisdom of a messenger of God, to know all which is upon the earth.
{14:21} And the king will say to Joab, Behold now, I did this word: and go and turn back the boy Absalom.
{14:22} And Joab will fall upon his face to the earth, and worship him, and bless the king: and Joab will say, This day thy servant knew that I found grace in thine eyes, my lord, O king, for that the king did the word of his servant.
{14:23} And Joab will rise and go to Geshur and bring Absalom to Jerusalem.
{14:24} And the king will say, He shall turn about to his house and not see my face. And Absalom will turn to his house and not see the face of the king.
{14:25} And as Absalom there was not a fair man in all Israel to praise greatly: from the sole of his foot and even to his crown, there was not a blemish in him.
{14:26} And in his shaving his head (and it was from the end of days to days that he will shave, for it was heavy upon him;) and he shaved and weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the stone of the king.
{14:27} And there will be born to Absalom three sons and one daughter, and her name Tamar: she was a woman of fair aspect.
{14:28} And Absalom dwelt in Jerusalem two years of days, and saw not the king's face.
{14:29} And Absalom will send to Joab to send him to the king, and he would not come to him: and he will send yet the second time, and he would not come.
{14:30} And he will say to his servants, See, Joab's portion to my hand, and barley to him there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the portion on fire.
{14:31} And Joab will rise and come to Absalom to the house, and say to him, Wherefore did thy servants set on fire the portion which is to me?
{14:32} And Absalom will say to Joab, Behold, I sent to thee, saying, Come hither, and I will send thee to the king, saying, Wherefore came I from Geshur? Good to me even I was there: and now I will see the king's face; and if there is iniquity in me, and kill me.
{14:33} And Joab will come to the king and announce to him: and he will call for Absalom, and he will come to the king and worship to him upon his face to the earth before the king: and the king will kiss Absalom.
{15:1} And it will be from after this, and Absalom will make to him chariots and horses, and fifty men running before him.
{15:2} And Absalom rose early and stood by the hand of the way of the gate: and it will be every man which shall be to him strife coming to the king for judgment, and Absalom will call to him and say, Where, from what city thou? And he will say, of one of the tribes of Israel is thy servant.
{15:3} And Absalom will say to him, See, thy words good and straight, and none to hear to thee from the king.
{15:4} And Absalom will say, Who will set me judge in the land? and to me shall every man come which shall be to him strife and judgment, and I did him justice.
{15:5} And it was in a man's coming near to worship to him, and he stretched forth his hand and laid hold of him, and kissed him.
{15:6} And Absalom will do according to this word to all Israel who will come for judgment to the king: and Absalom will steal the heart of the men of Israel.
{15:7} And it will be from the end of forty years, and Absalom will say to the king, I will go now and complete my vow which I vowed to Jehovah in Hebron.
{15:8} For thy servant vowed a vow in my dwelling in Geshur in Aram, saying, If turning back, Jehovah shall turn me back to Jerusalem, and I served Jehovah.
{15:9} And the king will say to him, Go in peace. And he will rise and go to Hebron.
{15:10} And Absalom will send spies in all the tribes of Israel, saying, When ye heard the voice of the trumpet, and ye said, Absalom the king in Hebron.
{15:11} And with Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem, being called; going uprightly, and they knew not any word.
{15:12} And Absalom will send for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, from Giloh, in his sacrificing sacrifices. And the conspiracy will be strong; and the people went and a multitude with Absalom.
{15:13} And he announcing, will come to David, saying, The heart of the man Israel was after Absalom.
{15:14} And David will say to all his servants which are with him in Jerusalem, Arise, and we will flee, for escape will not be to us from the face of Absalom: hasten to go lest he shall hasten to hedge us in, and thrust evil upon us, and smite the city with the mouth of the sword.
{15:15} And the king's servants will say to the king, According to all which my lord the king shall choose, behold thy servants.
{15:16} And the king will go forth, and all his house at his feet. And the king will leave ten women, concubines, to watch the house.
{15:17} And the king will go forth, and all the people at his feet, and they will stand in a house far off.
{15:18} And all his servants passing by upon his hand; and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came at his foot from Gath, passing by at the face of the king.
{15:19} And the king will say to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore wilt thou go, also thou, with us? turn back and dwell with the king, for thou a stranger and thou an exile to thy place.
{15:20} Yesterday thy coming, and this day shall I cause thee to wander about to go with us? and I go where I go, turn back, and turn back thy brethren with thee mercy and truth.
{15:21} And Ittai will answer the king, and say, Jehovah lives, and my lord the king lives, for surely in the place where my lord the king shall be, there whether for death, whether for life, for there will thy servant be.
{15:22} And David will say to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite will pass over, and all his men, and all the little ones that are with him.
{15:23} And all the land weeping with a great voice, and all the people passing over: and the king passed over upon the torrent Kidron, and all the people passing over upon the face of the way to the desert.
{15:24} And behold, also Zadok, and all the Levites with him, lifting up the ark of the covenant of God; and they placed the ark of God: and Abiathar will go up till all the people finished passing over from the city.
{15:25} And the king will say to Zadok, Turn back the ark of God to the city: if I shall find grace in the eyes of Jehovah, and he turned me back, and caused me to see it and its rest.
{15:26} And if he say thus, I delighted not in thee; behold me, he will do to me as is good in his eyes.
{15:27} And the king will say to Zadok the priest, Thou seest: turn back to the city in peace, and Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan son of Abiathar, your two sons with you.
{15:28} See me lingering in Araboth of the desert till word come from you to announce to me.
{15:29} And Zadok and Abiathar will turn back the ark of God to Jerusalem: and they will sit there.
{15:30} And David went up in the ascent of the olive trees, going up and weeping, and the head to him covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people which were with him covered each his head, and they went up, going up and weeping.
{15:31} And it was announced to David, saying, Ahithophel among those conspiring with Absalom. And David will say, Now make foolish the counsel of Ahithophel, O Jehovah.
{15:32} And it will be David came even to the head where he will worship there to God, and behold, to his meeting, Hushai the Archite, his tunic rent and earth upon his head.
{15:33} And David will say to him, If thou didst pass over with me thou wert for a burden to me.
{15:34} And if to the city, thou shalt turn back and say to Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; thy father's servant from then, and now thy servant: and thou didst frustrate for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
{15:35} And is not with thee there Zadok and Abiathar the priests? and it being all the word which thou shalt hear from the king's house, thou shalt announce to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests.
{15:36} Behold there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz to Zadok, and Jonathan to Abiathar; and send by their hand to me every word which ye shall hear.
{15:37} And Hushai, David's friend, will come to the city, and Absalom will come to Jerusalem.
{16:1} And David passed over a little from the head, and behold, Ziba, Mephibosheth's boy, to his meeting, and a pair of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred of bread and a hundred bunches of dried grapes, and a hundred of fruits, and a flask of wine.
{16:2} And the king will say to Ziba, What are these to thee? and Ziba will say, The asses for the house of the king to ride; and the bread and the fruits for the food of the boys, and the wine for the drinking of the faint in the desert.
{16:3} And the king will say, And where the son of thy lord? And Ziba will say to the king: Behold, he will dwell in Jerusalem: for he said, This day the house of Israel will turn back to me the kingdom of my father.
{16:4} And the king will say to Ziba, Behold, to thee all which was to Mephibosheth. And Ziba will say, I worshiped; shall I find grace in the eyes of my lord the king?
{16:5} And king David went to Bahurim, and behold, from thence a man will come forth from the family of the house of Saul, and his name Shimei, son of Gera: he came forth, coming forth and cursing.
{16:6} And he will stone David with stones, and all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty, from his right hand and from his left.
{16:7} And thus said Shimei in his cursing, Come forth, come forth, thou man of bloods and man of.
{16:8} Jehovah turned back upon thee Belial all the bloods of the house of Saul of whom thou didst reign in his stead; and Jehovah will give the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and behold thee in thine evil, for a man of bloods art thou.
{16:9} And Abishai son of Zeruiah will say to the king, Wherefore shall this dead dog curse my lord the king? I will pass over now and take away his head.
{16:10} And the king will say, What to me and you ye sons of Zeruiah? for he shall curse, and because Jehovah said to him, Curse David: and who shall say, Wherefore didst thou thus?
{16:11} And David will say to Abishai and to all his servants, Behold my son who came forth from my bowels seeks my soul: and how much more now the son of the Jaminite? Leave to him and he shall curse, for Jehovah said to him.
{16:12} Perhaps Jehovah will look upon my wrong, and Jehovah turn back to me good for his cursing this day.
{16:13} And David went, and his men, in the way; and Shimei went by the side of the mountain near to him going, and he will curse and stone with stones near to him, and dusting with dust.
{16:14} And the king will come, and all the people which are with him, weary, and he will be refreshed there.
{16:15} And Absalom and all the people, the man Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
{16:16} And it will be, as Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, and Hushai will say to Absalom, The king shall live, the king shall live.
{16:17} And Absalom will say to Hushai, This thy mercy with thy friend? wherefore wentest thou not with thy friend?
{16:18} And Hushai will say to Absalom, Nay; for whom Jehovah chose and this people, and every man of Israel, shall I not be and dwell with him?
{16:19} And the second time, to whom shall I serve if not before the son? as I served before thy father so will I be before thee.
{16:20} And Absalom will say to Ahithophel, Bring counsel to yourselves what we shall do.
{16:21} And Ahithophel will say to Absalom, Come in to thy father's concubines which he left to watch the house; and all Israel hearing that thou madest thy father loathsome, and the hands of all that are with thee were strengthened.
{16:22} And they will stretch out a tent for Absalom upon the roof, and Absalom will go in to his father's concubines before the eyes of all Israel.
{16:23} And the counsel of Ahithophel which he counseled in those days, according as it will be asked in the word of God: thus all the counsel of Ahithophel also to David also to Absalom.
{17:1} And Ahithophel will say to Absalom, I will now choose twelve thousand men, and I will rise and pursue after David this night:
{17:2} And I shall come upon him and he being weary and relaxed in hands, and I made him afraid: and all the people which are with him, fleeing; and I struck the king alone,
{17:3} And I will turn back all the people to thee: as the turning back of all, the man whom thou seekest; and to all the people shall be peace.
{17:4} And the word will be straight in the eyes of Absalom and in the eyes of all the old men of Israel.
{17:5} And Absalom will say, Call now also for Hushai the Archite, and we will hear also, what is in his mouth.
{17:6} And Hushai will come to Absalom, and Absalom will say to him, saying, According to this word spake Ahithophel: shall we do his word? if not, speak thou.
{17:7} And Hushai will say to Absalom, The counsel which Ahithophel counseled is not good in this time.
{17:8} And Hushai will say, Thou knewest thy father and his men that they are mighty, and they bitter of soul as a bear bereaved of offspring in the field: and thy father a man of war, and he will not lodge with the people.
{17:9} Behold now, he hid in one of the pits, or in one of the places: and it being when there fell among them in the beginning, and he hearing heard and said, was a slaughter among the people which are after Absalom.
{17:10} And he also the son of strength whose heart according to the heart of the lion, melting, will melt away: for all Israel knew that thy father is mighty, and the sons of strength which are with him.
{17:11} For I counseled being gathered, all Israel shall be gathered to thee from Dan and even to the Well of the Oath, as the sand which is upon the sea for multitude; and thy face going in the midst of them.
{17:12} And we came upon him in one of the places which we shall find there, and we upon him as the dew will fall upon the earth: and we will not leave of him and of all the men which are with him, even one.
{17:13} And if he shall be gathered into the city, and all Israel shall lift up ropes to that city, and we dragged it even to the torrent, till we shall not find there even a stone.
{17:14} And Absalom will say, and every man of Israel, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is good above the counsel of Ahithophel. And Jehovah commanded to frustrate the good counsel of Ahithophel so that Jehovah brought evil upon Absalom.
{17:15} And Hushai will say to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, According to this, and according to this, Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the old men of Israel; and according to this and according to this, I counseled.
{17:16} And now send quickly and announce to David, saying, Thou wilt not lodge this night in Araboth of the desert, and also passing over, thou shalt pass over, lest he shall swallow up to the king and to all the people which are with him.
{17:17} And Jonathan and Ahimaaz standing by the fountain of Rogel; and a maid-servant went and announced to them, and they will go, and announce to king David, for they will not be able to be seen to come to the city.
{17:18} And a boy will see them and be will announce to Absalom; and they two will go quickly and will come to the house of a man in Bahurim, and to him a well In his enclosure; and they will go down there,
{17:19} And the woman will take and spread the covering upon the mouth of the well and she will spread the medicine upon it; and the word will not be known.
{17:20} And Absalom's servants will come to the woman to her house, and they will say, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? and the woman will say to them, They passed over the brook of waters. And they will seek and not find; and they will turn back to Jerusalem.
{17:21} And it will be after their going, and they will come up out of the well and will go and announce to king David, and they will say to David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the waters, for thus counseled Ahithophel against you.
{17:22} And David will rise, and all the people which are with him, and they will pass over Jordan: till the light of the morning till not one was lacking which passed not over Jordan.
{17:23} And Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not done, and he will saddle the ass and rise and go to his house to his city, and command his house, and he will strangle himself and die. And he will be buried in the grave of his father.
{17:24} And David came to the camp. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
{17:25} And Absalom set Amasa instead of Joab over the army: and Amasa a man's son, and his name Ithra, the Israelite, who went in to Abigail, daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, mother of Joab.
{17:26} And Israel and Absalom will encamp in the land of Gilead.
{17:27} And it will be as David went to Mahanaim, and Shobi, son of Nahash of Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and Machir son of Ammiel of Lo-Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
{17:28} Beds and basins and vessels of earth, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched grain, and the bean and lentiles, and parched grain,
{17:29} And honey and curdled milk, and sheep, and cheeses of kine, they brought near for David and for the people which Are with him, to eat; for they said the people are hungry and faint and thirsty in the desert.
{18:1} And David will review the people which are with him, and he will put over them captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds.
{18:2} And David will send the people a third into the hand of Joab, and a third into the hand of Abishai, son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, and a third into the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king will say to the people, Going forth, I will go forth, also I, with you.
{18:3} And the people will say, Thou shalt not go forth, for if fleeing, we shall flee, they will not set the heart to us; and if half of us shall die they will not set the heart to us: but now like us ten thousand: and now it is good that thou shalt be to us from the city for help.
{18:4} And the king will say to them, What will be good in your eyes I will do. And the king will stand at the hand of the gate, and all the people will go forth, by hundreds and by thousands.
{18:5} And the king will command Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Gently for me to the boy, to Absalom. And all the people heard in the king's commanding all the chiefs for the word of Absalom.
{18:6} And the people will go forth to the field to the meeting of Israel: and the war will be in the forest of Ephraim;
{18:7} And there the people of Israel will be struck before David's servants, and a great slaughter will be in that day of twenty thousand.
{18:8} And there the battle will be scattered upon the face of all the earth: and the forest will multiply to consume of the people above what the sword will consume in that day.
{18:9} And Absalom will meet before the servants of David, and Absalom rode upon the mule, and the mule will go under the thicket of the great oak, and his head will lay hold upon the oak, and he will be given between the heavens and between the earth; and the mule which was under him passed by.
{18:10} And one man will see and announce to Joab, and say, Behold, I saw Absalom suspended in an oak.
{18:11} And Joab will say to the man announcing to him, And behold, thou sawest, and wherefore didst thou not strike him there to the earth? and for me to give to thee ten of silver and one girdle.
{18:12} And the man will say to Joab, And not I weighing upon my hand a thousand of silver, I will not stretch forth my hand against the king's son, for in our ears, the king commanded thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Watch for me over the boy, over Absalom.
{18:13} Or I did falsehood upon his soul; and any word will not be hid from the king, and thou wilt stand opposite.
{18:14} And Joab will say, I will not delay before thee. And he will take three spears in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absalom, he yet living in the heart of the oak.
{18:15} And ten boys lifting up Joab's arms will surround and strike Absalom, and kill him.
{18:16} And Joab will strike upon the trumpet, and the people will turn back from pursuing after Israel: for Joab restrained the people.
{18:17} And they will take Absalom and cast him in the forest into a great pit, and they will set upon him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled each to his tent.
{18:18} And Absalom took and set up for him in his living, a pillar in the valley of the king; for he said, Not to me a son to call my name to mind: and he will call the pillar by his name, and he will call it The Hand of Absalom, even to this day.
{18:19} And Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, said, I will run now and bring good news to the king that Jehovah judged him out of the hand of his enemies.
{18:20} And Joab will say to him, Not thou a man of glad tidings this day, and another day thou shalt announce good news: and this day thou shalt not announce good news, because the king's son died.
{18:21} And Joab will say to Cushi, Go, announce to the king what thou sawest. And Cushi will worship to Joab, and run.
{18:22} And Ahimaaz, son of Zadok will yet add, and say to Joab, What will be, I will run now, also I, after Cushi. And Joab will say, Wherefore this runnest thou my son, and goest, not finding good tidings?
{18:23} And what will be, I will run. And he will say to him, Run. And Ahimaaz will run the way of the circuit, and pass by Cushi.
{18:24} And David will sit between the two gates: and he watching will go to the roof of the gate to the wall, and he lift up his eyes and see, and behold, a man running by himself.
{18:25} And the watcher will call and announce to the king. And the king will say, If alone, good news in his month. And he will go, going, and draw near.
{18:26} And he watching will see another man running, and the watcher will call at the gate and say, Behold, a man running alone. And the king will say, This also announces good tidings.
{18:27} And the watcher will say, I saw the running of the first as the running of Ahimaaz, Zadok's son. And the king will say, A good man this, and he will come for good news.
{18:28} And Ahimaaz will call and say to the king, Peace. And he will worship to the king upon the face to the earth, and he will say, Blessed Jehovah thy God who shut up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
{18:29} And the king will say, Peace to the boy, to Absalom? And Ahimaaz will say, I saw the great multitude at Joab's sending the King's servant, and thy servant; and I knew not what.
{18:30} And the king will say, Turn, stand here. And he will turn and stand.
{18:31} And behold, Cushi came; and Cushi will say, Good news will be announced, my lord the king, for Jehovah judged thee this day from the hand of all rising up against thee.
{18:32} And the king will say to Cushi, Is peace to the boy, to Absalom? And Cushi will say, As the boy, shall all the enemies of my lord the king be, and all who rose up against thee for evil.
{18:33} And the king will be moved, and he will go up into the upper chamber of the gate and weep: and thus he said in his going, My son Absalom! my son, my son Absalom I who will give my death, me for thee, Absalom my son, my son!
{19:1} And it will be announced to Joab, Behold, the king weeping, and he will mourn for Absalom.
{19:2} And the salvation in that day will be turned to mourning to all the people: for the people heard in that day, saying the king was grieved for his son.
{19:3} And the people will steal away in that day to go to the city, as people will steal away being ashamed in fleeing in battle.
{19:4} And the king covered his face, and the king will cry out with a great voice, My son Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!
{19:5} And Joab will come to the king, to the house, and say, Thou shamedst this day the faces of all thy servants saving thy soul this day, and the soul of thy sons and thy daughters, and the soul of thy wives, and the soul of thy concubines;
{19:6} To love those hating thee, and hating those loving thee, for thou announcedst this day that not to the chiefs and servants: for I knew this day that if Absalom lived and all we this day died, that then it was straight in thine eyes.
{19:7} And now arise, go forth, and speak to the heart of thy servants: for in Jehovah I swore if thou wilt not go forth, if a man shall lodge with thee this night: and this evil to thee above all the evil which came upon thee from thy youth till now.
{19:8} And the king will rise and sit in the gate. And to all the people they announced, saying, Behold, the king sitting in the gate. And all the people will come before the king: and Israel fled a man to his tent.
{19:9} And all the people will be judging in all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us from the hand of the rovers and now he fled from the land from Absalom.
{19:10} And Absalom whom we anointed over us died in war. And now, wherefore are ye silent to turn back the king?
{19:11} And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak ye to the old men of Judah, saying, Wherefore will ye be the last to turn back the king to his house? And the word of all Israel came to the king to his house.
{19:12} Ye my brethren; my bone and flesh are ye: and wherefore will ye be last to turn back the king?
{19:13} And to Amasa ye shall say, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? thus will God do to me and thus will he add, if thou shalt not be chief of the army before me all the days, instead of Joab.
{19:14} And he will incline the heart of all the men of Judah as one man; and they will send to the king, Turn back thou, and all thy servants.
{19:15} And the king will turn back and come to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to cause the king to pass over Jordan.
{19:16} And Shimei son of Gera, a Benjamite, who was from Bahurim, will hasten and come down with the man Judah to meet king David.
{19:17} And a thousand men with him from Benjamin, and Ziba the boy of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.
{19:18} The passing over passed over to cause the house of the king to pass over, and to do the good in his eyes. And Shimei son of Gera, fell before the king in his passing over Jordan.
{19:19} And he will say to the king, My lord will not reckon iniquity to me, and he will not remember what thy servant did perversely in the day which my lord the king came forth from Jerusalem, for the king to set to his heart.
{19:20} For thy servant knew that I sinned: and behold, I came this day the first for all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.
{19:21} And Abishai son of Zeruiah, will say, For this shall not Shimei be put to death? for he cursed Jehovah's Messiah.
{19:22} And David will say, What to me, and to you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye shall be to me for an adversary? Shall there this day be a man put to death in Israel? Did I not know that this day I am king over Israel?
{19:23} And the king will say to Shimei, Thou shalt not die: and the king will swear to him.
{19:24} And Mephibosheth son of Saul, came down to the meeting of the king, and he did not his feet, and he did not his beard, and his garments he washed not from the day the king went till the day in which he came in peace.
{19:25} And it will be when he came to Jerusalem to the meeting of the king, and the king will say to him, Wherefore wentest thou not with me, Mephibosheth?
{19:26} And he will say, My lord the king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle for me the ass, and I will ride upon it, and I will go to the king; for thy servant is lame.
{19:27} And he will slander against thy servant to my lord the king; and my lord the king as a messenger of God: and do thou the good in thine eyes.
{19:28} For was not all my father's house but men of death before my lord the king? and thou wilt set thy servant among those eating at thy table. And what is there to me yet of right and to cry yet to the king?
{19:29} And the king will say to him, Wherefore wilt thou speak yet thy words? I said, Thou and Ziba shall divide the field.
{19:30} And Mephibosheth will say to the king, Also he shall take all, after that my lord the king came in peace to his house.
{19:31} And Barzillai the Gileadite will come down from Rogelim, and he will pass with the king over Jordan to send him upon Jordan.
{19:32} And Barzillai a very old man, the son of eighty years: and he nourished the king in his dwelling in the two camps, for he was an exceeding great man.
{19:33} And the king will say to Barzillai, Pass thou over with me, and I will nourish thee with me in Jerusalem.
{19:34} And Barzillai will say to the king, According to what the days of the years of my life, that I shall go up with the king to Jerusalem?
{19:35} The son of eighty years am I this day; shall I know between good to evil? if thy servant shall taste what I shall eat, and what I shall drink? if I shall yet hear to the voice of men singing or of women singing? and wherefore shall thy servant be yet for a burden to my lord the king?
{19:36} As thy servant will pass a little over Jordan with the king; and wherefore shall the king recompense me this recompense?
{19:37} Turn back now thy servant and I will die in my city, by the grave of my father and my mother: and behold, thy servant Chimham shall pass over with my lord the king; and do to him what is good in thine eyes.
{19:38} And the king will say, With me shall Chimham pass over, and I will do to him the good in thine eyes; and all which thou shalt choose of me I will do to thee.
{19:39} And all the people will pass over Jordan. And the king passed over, and the king will kiss to Barzillai, and bless him: and he will turn back to his place.
{19:40} And the king will pass over to Gilgal, and Chimham passed over with him: and all the people of Judah will pass over with the king, and also half the people of Israel.
{19:41} And behold, every man of Israel coming to the king, and they will say to the king, Wherefore did our brethren the men of Judah steal thee away, and they will cause the king to pass, and his house, over Jordan, and all David's men with him?
{19:42} And every man of Judah will answer to the man Israel, Because the king being near to me: and wherefore does this kindle to thee on account of this word? did we eat food from the king? or lifting up, did he lift up to us?
{19:43} And the man Israel will answer the man Judah, and say, Ten hands to me in the king, and also in David I above thee: and wherefore didst thou make light of me? and was not my word first to me to turn back my king? And the word of the man Judah will will be hard above the word of the man Israel.
{20:1} And a man of Belial was met with there, and his name Sheba, son of Bichri, a man, a Jaminite: and he will strike upon the trumpet and say, No portion to us in David, and no inheritance to us in the son of Jesse: a man to his tent to Israel.
{20:2} And every man of Israel will go up from after David, after Sheba, son of Bichri: and the men of Judah were joined to the king, from Jordan and even to Jerusalem.
{20:3} And David will come to his house to Jerusalem; and the king will take the ten women, the concubines which he left to watch the house, and he will give them to the house of watch, and he will nourish them, and he went not in to them. And they will be bound together till the day of their death to live widows.
{20:4} And the king will say to Amasa, Call together to me the men of Judah in three days, and stand thou here.
{20:5} And Amasa will go to call Judah together: and he will delay from the appointment which he appointed him.
{20:6} And David will say to Abishai, Now Sheba son of Bichri will do evil to us above Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants and go down after him, lest finding to himself fortified cities and he shadow our eyes.
{20:7} And Joab's men went forth after him, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and all the mighty went forth from Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba son of Bichri.
{20:8} They by the great stone which is in the hill, and Amasa went before them. And Joab girded his garment being put upon him, and upon it he girded the sword being bound upon his loins in its sheath; and he going forth and it will fall.
{20:9} And Joab will say to Amasa, Thou my brother in peace? and Joab's right hand will take hold of Amasa by the beard to kiss him.
{20:10} And Amasa watched not upon the sword which was in Joab's hand: and he will strike him with it into the belly, and his bowels will be poured forth to the earth; and he repeated not to him; and he will die. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba son of Bichri.
{20:11} And a man from Joab's boys stood by him, and he will say, Who delighted in Joab, and who that is for David, after Joab.
{20:12} And Amasa rolling in blood in the midst of the highway. And the man will see that all the people stood, and he will turn Amasa from the highway to the field, and he will cast upon him a garment when he saw all coming by him and standing.
{20:13} When he was taken away from the highway every man passed by after Joab to pursue after Sheba son of Bichri.
{20:14} And he will pass through in all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to the house of oppression, and all the Berites: and they will be called together, and they will go also after him.
{20:15} And they will come and besiege against him in Abel of the house of oppression, and they will pour out a mound against the city, and it will stand in the fortification: and all the people which were with Joab laying waste to throw down the wall.
{20:16} And a wise woman will call out of the city, Hear ye, hear ye; say now to Joab, Come near hither and I will speak to you.
{20:17} And he will draw near to her, and the woman will say, Art thou Joab? and he will say, I. And she will say to him, Hear the words of thy servant And he will say, I hear.
{20:18} And she will say, saying, They will speak the word in the beginning, saying, They will ask an asking in Abel: and thus they finished.
{20:19} I peaceful of the faithful of Israel: thou seeking to kill a city and a mother in Israel: wherefore wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?
{20:20} And Joab will say, Far be it, far be it to me, if I shall swallow up and if I shall destroy.
{20:21} Not thus the word; for a man from mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri, his name, lifted up his hand against the king, against David: ye shall give him only, and I will go from the city. And the woman will say to Joab, Behold, his head being cast to thee behind the wall.
{20:22} And the woman will go to all the people in her wisdom: and they will cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and cast to Joab. And he will strike upon the trumpet, and they will disperse from the city, a man to his tent. And Joab turned back to Jerusalem to the king.
{20:23} And Joab over all the army of Israel: and Benaiah, son of Jehoida, over the Cherethites, and over the Pelethites.
{20:24} And Adoniram over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, calling to mind:
{20:25} And Sheva the scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
{20:26} And also Ira the Jairite was priest to David.
{21:1} And there will be a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David will seek the face of Jehovah. And Jehovah will say, For Saul and for the house of bloods, because he killed the Gibeonites.
{21:2} And the king will call for the Gibeonites, and say to them; (and the Gibeonites not of the sons of Israel, but they from the remainder of the Amorites; and the sons of Israel sware to them: and Saul will seek to strike them in his jealousy for the sons of Israel and Judah.)
{21:3} And David will say to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and with what shall I expiate and bless ye the inheritance of Jehovah?
{21:4} And the Gibeonites will say to him, Not to me silver and gold with Saul and with his house; and not for us to put a man to death in Israel. And he will say, What ye say, I will do for you.
{21:5} And they will say to the king, The man who finished us, and who made an end of us, destroying us from standing in all the bound of Israel,
{21:6} Seven men of his sons shall be given to us and we will hang them up before Jehovah in the hill of Saul, the chosen of Jehovah. And the king will say, I will give.
{21:7} And the king will spare upon Mephibosheth, son of Jonathan, son of Saul, on account of the oath of Jehovah which was between them, between David and between Jonathan, son of Saul.
{21:8} And the king will take the two sons of Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, which she bare to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth, and the five sons of Michal, Saul's daughter, which she bare to Adriel, son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
{21:9} And he will give them into the hand of the Gibeonites, and they will hang them in the mountain before Jehovah: and the seven will fall together, and they were put to death in the days of harvest in the first of the beginning of the harvest of barley.
{21:10} And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah will take sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest till water was given upon them from the heavens, and she gave not the birds of the heavens to rest upon them in the day and the beast of the field at night.
{21:11} And it will be announced to David what Rizpah the daugther of Aiah, concubine of Saul did.
{21:12} And David will go and take the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan, his son, from the lords of Jabesh-Gilead, who stole them from the street of the House of Shan, where the rovers hung them there in the day the rovers struck Saul in Gilboa:
{21:13} And he will bring up from thence the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they will gather the bones of those being hung.
{21:14} And they will bury the bones of Saul, and Jonathan his son, in the land of Benjamin in Zelzah in the grave of Kish his father: and they will do all which the king commanded. And God will hear for the land after this.
{21:15} And yet there will be war to the rovers with Israel; and David will go down, and his servants with him, and they will fight with the rovers: and David will be faint.
{21:16} And Ishbi-Benob who was from the children of Rephaim, and the weight of his spear three hundred weight of brass, and he being girded with a new one, and he will say to strike David.
{21:17} And Abishai son of Zeruiah will help for him, and he will strike the rover and kill him. Then David's men sware to him, saying, Thou shalt no more go forth with us to war, and thou shalt not quench the light of Israel.
{21:18} And it will be after this, and there will be war yet in Gob with the rovers: then Sibbechai the Hushathite struck Saph who was of the children of Rephaim.
{21:19} And there will be yet war in Gob with the rovers, and Elhanan, son of Jaare-Oregim of the House of Bread, will strike Goliah the Gathite, and the wood of his spear as the beam of those weaving.
{21:20} And there will be yet war in Gath, and there will be a man of Midian, and the fingers of his hands and the toes of his feet, six and six; twenty and four of number: and also he child to Rephah.
{21:21} And he will reproach Israel, and Jonathan, son of Shimeab, David's brother, will strike him.
{21:22} Those four were born to Rephah in Oath, and they will fall by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
{22:1} And David will speak to Jehovah the words of this song in the day Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul:
{22:2} And he will say, Jehovah my rock and my fastness and my deliverer;
{22:3} The God of my rock; I will trust in him: My shield and the horn of my salvation, my height and my refuge; My saviour; thou wilt save me from violence.
{22:4} Praising, I will call Jehovah and shall be saved from mine enemies.
{22:5} For the breakers of death surrounded me The torrents of Beilal will terrify me;
{22:6} The pangs of hades surrounded me; The snares of death anticipated me;
{22:7} In straits to me I will call Jehovah, And to God will I call, And he will hear my voice from his temple, And my cry in his ears.
{22:8} And the earth will shake and tremble, The foundation of the heavens will be disturbed, And they will shake, for it kindled to him.
{22:9} Smoke went up in his anger, And fire from his mouth shall consume: Coals were kindled from it.
{22:10} He will incline the heavens and come down; And darkness under his feet.
{22:11} And he will ride upon a cherub and fly: And he will be seen upon the wings of the wind.
{22:12} And he will set darkness round about him for booths, The gatherings of waters the darkness of clouds.
{22:13} From the shining before him were coals of fire kindled:
{22:14} Jehovah will thunder from the heavens, And the Most High will give his voice.
{22:15} He will send arrows and scatter them lightning, and put them in commotion.
{22:16} The torrents of the sea will be seen, The foundations of the habitable globe will be uncovered, In the rebuke of Jehovah, from the breath of the spirit of his anger.
{22:17} He will send from height, he will take me; He will draw me out of many waters:
{22:18} He will deliver me from my strong enemy, From them hating me, for they were strong above me.
{22:19} They will anticipate me in the day of misfortune, And Jehovah will be a support to me:
{22:20} And he will bring me forth to a wide place; He will deliver me for he delighted in me.
{22:21} Jehovah will recompense me according to my justice: According to the cleanness of my hands he turned back to me.
{22:22} For I have watched the ways of Jehovah, And I acted not wickedly away from my God.
{22:23} For all his judgments before me, And his laws I will not depart from them.
{22:24} And I will be blameless to him, and I shall be washed from mine iniquity.
{22:25} Jehovah will turn back to me according to my justice: According to my cleanness before his eyes.
{22:26} With the merciful thou wilt be merciful, With the perfect man thou wilt be perfect.
{22:27} With the chosen thou wilt be chosen, And with the perverse thou wilt be unseasoned.
{22:28} And the people of affliction thou wilt save: And thine eyes upon the lifted up, thou wilt humble.
{22:29} For thou my light, O Jehovah: And Jehovah will enlighten my darkness.
{22:30} For in thee will I run, being pressed In my God will I leap over a wall.
{22:31} The Strong One, blameless his way The saying of Jehovah purified, A shield to all trusting in him.
{22:32} For who God besides Jehovah? And who a rock besides our God?
{22:33} The Strong One strengthening me with strength: And he will leave his way blameless.
{22:34} Setting my feet as the hinds: And upon the heights will he cause me to stand.
{22:35} Teaching my hands to the war, And bringing down the brazen bow by mine arm.
{22:36} And thou wilt give to me the shield of thy salvation, and thine answer will multiply me.
{22:37} Thou wilt enlarge my steps under me, And my joints were not unsteady.
{22:38} I will pursue mine enemies and destroy them I will not turn back even to finishing them.
{22:39} And I will consume them and crush them, and they shall not be raised up.
{22:40} Thou wilt fasten me together with strength for the war, Thou wilt subdue under me him rising up against me.
{22:41} And the neck of mine enemies wilt thou give to me Those hating me, and I will cut them off.
{22:42} They will look, and no saviour To Jehovah, and he answered them not.
{22:43} And I will rub them as the dust of the earth: As the mire of the streets I will stamp them, I will beat them:
{22:44} And thou wilt save me from the strifes of my people, Thou wilt watch me for the head of nations: The people I have not known shall serve me.
{22:45} The sons of the stranger will lie to me: For the hearing of the ear they will hear to me.
{22:46} The sons of the stranger shall fail, and be girded from their enclosings.
{22:47} Jehovah living; and praised my rock: And God shall be lifted up, the rock of my salvation.
{22:48} The Strong One giving vengeance to me, And bringing down peoples under me.
{22:49} And bringing me out from mine enemies lifting me up from them rising up against me: From the man of violence thou wilt deliver me.
{22:50} For this will I praise thee, O Jehovah, in the nations, to thy name will I play on the harp.
{22:51} Magnifying the salvation of his king: And he has done mercy to his Messiah To David and to his seed even to forever.
{23:1} And these the last words of David. The declaration of David, son of Jesse, and the declaration of the man raised up for the Messiah of the God of Jacob, and the sweet songs of Israel.
{23:2} The Spirit of Jehovah spake in me, and his word upon my tongue.
{23:3} The God of Israel said to me, the Rock of Israel spake a parable upon the just man: a parable to fear God.
{23:4} And as the light of the morning the sun will rise: the morning not dense; from the shining of the rain bringing forth herbage from the earth.
{23:5} For not thus my house with the Strong One, for he set to me an eternal covenant, prepared in all, and watched: for all my salvation and delight will he not bring forth.
{23:6} And Belial as the thorn thrusting out are all they, for they will not be taken by the hand.
{23:7} And the man laboring in them shall be filled with iron and the wood of a spear; and in fire burning they shall burn in the dwelling.
{23:8} These the names of the mighty, which were to David: the Tachmonite dwelling in the dwelling, head of the third; he Adino the Eznite: against eight hundred wounded at one time.
{23:9} And after him Eleazar son of Dodo, son of Ahohi, among the three mighty with David in their upbraiding the rovers; they were gathered together there to war, and the men of Israel will go up.
{23:10} He arose, and he will strike against the rovers till that his hand will be weary, and his hand will cleave to the sword: and Jehovah will do a great salvation in that day; and they sat down behind him only to strip off.
{23:11} And after him, Shammah, son of Aga the Hararite. And the rovers will be gathered together to live; and there will be there a portion of the field full of lentiles: and the people fled from the face of the rovers.
{23:12} And he will stand in the midst of the portion, and he will take it away, and he will strike the rovers: and Jehovah will do a great salvation.
{23:13} And three of the thirty heads will go down and come to the harvest, to David, to the cave of Adullam: and the wild beasts, the rovers, encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
{23:14} And David then in the fortress, and the station of the rovers then in the House of Bread.
{23:15} And David will desire and say, Who will give me to drink waters from the well of the House of Bread, which is in the gate?
{23:16} And the three mighty will break forth through the camp of the rovers, and draw waters from the well of the House of Bread, which is in the gate, and they will lift up and bring to David: and he would not drink them, and he will pour them out to Jehovah.
{23:17} And he will say, Far be it to me, O Jehovah, my doing this the blood of the men going with their souls: and he would not drink them. These did the three mighty.
{23:18} And Abishai Joab's brother, son of Zeruiah, he the head of the three. And he raised up his spear against three hundred wounded, and to him a name among the three.
{23:19} Above the three was he not honored? and he will be to them for chief: and he came not even to the three.
{23:20} And Benaiah son of Jehoida, son of a living man great of works, from Kabzeel, he struck two lions of god of Moab: and he went down and struck a lion in the midst of a well in the day of snow.
{23:21} And he struck a man, an Egyptian, who was seeing; and in the hand of the Egyptian a spear; and he went down to him with a rod, and he will pluck the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and kill him with his spear.
{23:22} These did Benaiah son of Jehoida, and to him a name among the three mighty.
{23:23} He was honored above the thirty, and to the three he came not. And David will set him to his audience.
{23:24} Asahel, brother of Joab, among the thirty; Elhanan, son of Dodo of the House of Bread.
{23:25} Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
{23:26} Helez the Paltite, Ira, son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
{23:27} Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
{23:28} Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
{23:29} Heleb, son of Banah the Netophathite, Ittai, son of Ribai, from the hill of the sons of Benjamin,
{23:30} Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the torrents of Gaash,
{23:31} Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
{23:32} Eliahba the Shaalbonite; of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
{23:33} Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite,
{23:34} Eliphalet, son of Ahasbai, son of the Maacathite, Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
{23:35} Hezri the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
{23:36} Igal son of Nathan of Zobah, sons of the Gadite,
{23:37} Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, lifting up the arms of Joab, son of Zeruiah,
{23:38} Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
{23:39} Uriah the Hittite: all, thirty and seven.
{24:1} And the anger of Jehovah will add to kindle against Israel, and he stimulated David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.
{24:2} And the king will say to Joab, chief of the army which was with him, Go now, up and down through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan and even to the Well of the Oath, and review ye the people, and I shall know the number of the people.
{24:3} And Joab will say to the king, Jehovah thy God will add to the people as they and as they a hundred times, and the eyes of my lord the king seeing: and my lord the king, wherefore delights he in this word?
{24:4} And the king's word will be strong to Joab and to the chiefs of his army. And Joab went forth and the chiefs of his army before the king to review the people Israel.
{24:5} And they will pass over Jordan, and they will encamp in Aroer, the right hand of the city which is in the midst of the torrent of Gad, and towards Jazer:
{24:6} And they will come to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-Hodshi; and they will come to Dan-Jaan, and round about to Zidon.
{24:7} And they will come to the fortress of Tyre, and all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites; and they will go forth to the south of Judah to the Well of the Oath.
{24:8} And they will turn aside through all the land, and they will come from the end of nine months and twenty days to Jerusalem.
{24:9} And Joab will give the number of the reviewing of the people to the king: and there will be of Israel eight hundred thousand men of strength drawing sword; and the men of Judah, five hundred thousand men.
{24:10} And the heart of David will strike him after he thus reviewed the people. And David will say to Jehovah, I sinned greatly in what I did: and now, O Jehovah, now pass by the iniquity of thy servant, for I was very foolish.
{24:11} And David will rise in the morning, and the word of Jehovah was to Gad the prophet, seer of David, saying,
{24:12} Go and speak to David, Thus said Jehovah, Three I lay upon thee: choose to thee one from them, and I will do to thee.
{24:13} And Gad will come to David and announce to him, and say to him, Shall seven years of famine come to thee in thy land? and if three mouths to flee before thine adversaries, they pursuing thee? and if death to be three days in thy land? now know, and see what word I shall turn back to him sending me.
{24:14} And David will say to Gad, Straits to me exceedingly: now we will fall into the hand of Jehovah, for many his compassions; and into the hand of man I will not fall.
{24:15} And Jehovah will give death in Israel from the morning and even to the time of the appointment; and from the people will die from Dan and even to the Well of the Oath, seventy thousand men.
{24:16} And the messenger will stretch forth his hand to destroy Jerusalem, and Jehovah will lament for the evil, and he will say to the messenger destroying among the people, Much now: let go thy hand. And the messenger of Jehovah was near the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
{24:17} And David will say to Jehovah, in his seeing the messenger smiting the people, and he will say, Behold, I sinned and acted perversely; and these sheep, what did they? Now shall thy hand be upon me and upon my father's house.
{24:18} And Gad will come to David in that day and say to him, Go up, raise up an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
{24:19} And David will go up, according to the word of Gad, as Jehovah commanded.
{24:20} And Araunah will look forth and see the king and his servants passing over to him: and Araunah will go forth and worship to the king, his face to the earth.
{24:21} And Araunah will say, Wherefore came my lord the king to his servant? and David will say, To buy from thee the threshing-floor to build an altar to Jehovah, and the slaughter shall be withheld from above the people.
{24:22} And Araunah will say to David, My lord the king shall take and bring up the good in his eyes: see, the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing-rollers, and the instruments of the oxen for wood.
{24:23} And Araunah gave all to the king for the king. And Araunah will say to the king, Jehovah thy God will take pleasure in thee.
{24:24} And the king will say to Araunah, Nay, but buying, I will buy of thee at a price; and I will not bring up to Jehovah my God a burnt-offering gratuitously. And David will buy the threshing-floor and the oxen for the silver of fifty shekels.
{24:25} And David will build there an altar to Jehovah, and he will bring up burnt-offerings and peace. And Jehovah will be entreated for the land, and the slaughter will be withheld from Israel.
