{1:1} Paul, sent, (not from men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, having raised him from the dead;)
{1:2} And with me all the brethren, to the churches of Galatia:
{1:3} Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
{1:4} Having given himself for our sins, that he might take us away out of this present evil time, according to the will of God and our Father:
{1:5} To whom the glory for the time of times. Amen.
{1:6} I wonder that so quickly are ye transferred from him having called you by the grace of Christ to another good news:
{1:7} Which is not another; except some are troubling you, and wishing to pervert the good news of Christ.
{1:8} But also if we, or a messenger from heaven, announce good news to you, more than what: we have announced to you, let him be anathema.
{1:9} As we said before, also now say I again, If any announce to you good news above what ye received, let him be anathema.
{1:10} For now do I persuade men, or God? or seek I to please men? for if I had yet pleased men, I should not have been the servant of Christ.
{1:11} But I make known to you, brethren, the good news announced by me that it is not according to man.
{1:12} For I neither received it from man, neither was I taught, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
{1:13} For ye heard of my turning about when in Judaism, that in excess I drove out the church of God, and laid it waste:
{1:14} And I advanced in Judaism above many like in my race, being more abundantly zealous of paternal traditions.
{1:15} And when God was contented, having separated me from my mother's womb, and having called me, by his grace,
{1:16} To reveal his Son in me, that I might announce him the good news in the nations; I consulted not with flesh and blood:
{1:17} Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them sent before me; but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus.
{1:18} Then after three years I came up to Jerusalem to examine Peter, and remained with him fifteen days.
{1:19} And other of the sect I saw not, except James the Lord's brother.
{1:20} And what I write to you, behold, before God, that I lie not.
{1:21} Then came I to the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
{1:22} And was unknown by face to the churches of Judea there in Christ.
{1:23} And only they had heard, That he then driving us out, now announces the good news, the faith which he then felt the absence of.
{1:24} And they glorified God in me.
{2:1} Then after fourteen years, again went I up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, having taken together Titus.
{2:2} And I went up according to revelation, and placed before them the good news which I proclaim in the nations, but apart to them highly esteemed, lest I run in vain, or ran.
{2:3} But neither Titus, with me, being a Greek, was forced to be circumcised:
{2:4} And through false brethren introduced privately, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might reduce us to slavery:
{2:5} To whom we yielded in subjection, not for an hour; that the truth of the good news might remain with you.
{2:6} And from them seeming to be something, (whatever they were, it concerns me nothing: God receives not man's face:) for they seeming entrusted nothing to me:
{2:7} But on the contrary, having seen that I have been entrusted with the good news of uncircumcision, as Peter of circumcision;
{2:8} (For be having been energetic in Peter for the mission of circumcision, was energetic also in me for the nations:)
{2:9} And having known the grace given to me, James, and Cephas, and John, seeming to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hands of communion; that we for the nations, and they for the circumcision.
{2:10} Only that we remember the poor; and this same was I forward to do.
{2:11} And when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to the face, for he was to be rebuked.
{2:12} For before certain came from James, he ate with the nations: and when they came, he drew down, and separated himself, being afraid of them of the circumcision.
{2:13} And the rest of the Jews also dissembled with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
{2:14} But when I saw that they went not upon the strait road according to the truth of the good news, I said to Peter before all, If thou, being a Jew, livest according to the nations, and not according to the Jews, why forcest thou the nations to live as the Jews?
{2:15} We by nature Jews, and not sinners from the nations,
{2:16} Knowing that a man is not justified from the works of the law, but through faith of Jesus Christ, and we believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified from the faith of Christ, and not from the works of the law: therefore from the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
{2:17} And it; seeking to be justified in Christ, we were found also ourselves sinners, is Christ therefore the servant of sin? It may not be.
{2:18} For if what I destroy, these I build again, I unite myself with the transgressor.
{2:19} For I through the law died to the law, that. I might live to God.
{2:20} I am crucified with Christ: and I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in we: and what I now live in the flesh I live in the faith of the Son of God, having loved me, and given himself for me.
{2:21} I put not away the grace of God for if justice through the law, Christ died in vain.
{3:1} O Unwise Galatians, who has cast a spell upon you, not to obey the truth, to whom before the eyes Jesus Christ was written beforehand, crucified in you?
{3:2} This only wish I to learn from you, Received ye the Spirit from the works of the law, or from the hearing of faith?
{3:3} Are ye so unwise? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now completed in the flesh?
{3:4} Suffered ye so many things in vain? if yet also in vain.
{3:5} He therefore furnishing you the Spirit, and working the powers in you, is it from the works of the law, or from the hearing of faith?
{3:6} As Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for justice.
{3:7} Know ye therefore that they of faith, these are sons of Abraham.
{3:8} And the writing, foreseeing that of faith God justifies the nations, announced beforehand the good news to Abraham, That in thee shall all nations be praised.
{3:9} So that they of faith are praised with faithful Abraham.
{3:10} For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it has been written, Cursed every one who remains not in all written in the book of the law to do them.
{3:11} And that none is justified in the law before God, is manifest: for, The just shall live of faith.
{3:12} And the law is not of faith: but, The man having done them shall live in them.
{3:13} Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having been a curse for us: for it has been written, Cursed every one hanging upon a tree:
{3:14} That the praise of Abraham might be to the nations in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
{3:15} Brethren, I speak according to man; Although a man's covenant, having been confirmed, none annuls, or orders an addition.
{3:16} And to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He says not, And to seeds, as to many; but as to one: And to thy seed, who is Christ.
{3:17} And I say this, the covenant confirmed before by God in Christ, the law, having been after four hundred and thirty years, does not annul, to neglect the promise.
{3:18} For if of the law the inheritance, no more of promise: and God has favored Abraham by promise.
{3:19} What then the law? It was added on account of transgressions, (till the seed come to whom it was promised;) appointed by angels in the hand of a mediator.
{3:20} And a mediator is not of one, and God is one.
{3:21} The law then against the promises of God? It may not be: for if a law had been given able to make alive, truly justice would be by the law.
{3:22} But the writing shut up all things under sin, that the promise from faith of Jesus Christ might be given to the believing.
{3:23} And before faith came, we were guarded under the law, shut up to faith about to be revealed.
{3:24} So that the law was our preceptor towards Christ, that we might be justified from faith.
{3:25} And faith having come, we are no more under a preceptor.
{3:26} For we are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
{3:27} For as many of you as were immersed into Christ have put on Christ.
{3:28} There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither servant nor free, there is neither male and female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
{3:29} And if ye of Christ, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.
{4:1} And I say, for as long time as the heir is a child, he differs nothing from a servant, being lord of all;
{4:2} But is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father.
{4:3} So also we, when we were children, were subjugated under the world's elements:
{4:4} And when the completion of the time was come, God sent his Son, born of woman, born under the law,
{4:5} That he might redeem them under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.
{4:6} And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
{4:7} So that thou art no more a servant, but a son: and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.
{4:8} But then truly, not having known God, ye were in a servile condition to them not being gods by nature.
{4:9} And now, having known God, and rather known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and poor elements, to which again ye wish anew to be in a servile condition.
{4:10} Ye observe narrowly days, and months, and times, and years.
{4:11} I am afraid of you, lest I have been wearied for you in vain.
{4:12} Be ye as I, for I also as you, brethren, I pray you: ye injured me nothing.
{4:13} And ye know that through weakness of the flesh I announced the good news to you before.
{4:14} And my temptation in my flesh, ye counted not as nothing, nor spurned; but as an angel of God ye received me, as Christ Jesus.
{4:15} What then was your happiness? for I testify to you, that, if possible, having plucked out your eyes, ye would have given to me.
{4:16} Have I then been your enemy, speaking truth to you.
{4:17} They are zealous for you, not well; but they wish to exclude you, that ye might be zealous for them.
{4:18} And good to be zealous always in good, and not only in my being present with you.
{4:19} My children, for whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you,
{4:20} And I would be present with you now, and change my voice; for I am perplexed about you.
{4:21} Tell me, those wishing to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
{4:22} For it has been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondmaid, and one by the free.
{4:23} But he truly of the bondmaid was born according to the flesh; and he of the free through the promise.
{4:24} Which things are spoken figuratively: for these are the two covenants; one truly from mount Sinai, begetting to bondage, which is Agar.
{4:25} For Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and now stands in the same rank With Jerusalem, and is in a servile condition with her children.
{4:26} But Jerusalem above is free, which is mother of us all.
{4:27} For it has been written, Be cheered, O barren, bearing not; break out and cry, she travailing not: for many more the children of the desolate than she having a husband.
{4:28} And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise.
{4:29} But as then he born according to the flesh drove out him according to the Spirit, so also now.
{4:30} But what says the writing? Cast out the bondmaid and her son; for the son of the bondmaid shall not inherit with the son of the free.
{4:31} Therefore, brethren, we are not children of the bondmaid, but of the free.
{5:1} Therefore in the liberty which Christ has freed us, stand ye, and be not again held in the yoke of servitude.
{5:2} Behold, I Paul say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
{5:3} And again to any man circumcised, I testify, that he is debtor to do the whole law.
{5:4} Ye were neglected from Christ, whoever are justified in the law; ye have fallen from grace.
{5:5} For we in spirit by faith expect the hope of justice.
{5:6} For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any power, nor uncircumcision; but faith being energetic through love.
{5:7} Ye were running well; who hindered you not to obey the truth?
{5:8} The confidence not from him calling you.
{5:9} A little leaven leavens the whole mixture.
{5:10} I have trusted to you in the Lord, that ye will have nothing different in mind; and he troubling you shall bear judgment, whoever he be.
{5:11} And I, brethren, if I yet proclaim circumcision, why am I. yet driven out? therefore the offence of the cross is left unemployed.
{5:12} I would also they shall be cut off who having risen up against you.
{5:13} For ye were called to liberty brethren; only not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but through love serve ye one another.
{5:14} For all the law is completed in one word, in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
{5:15} And if ye bite and devour one another, see ye that ye be not laid waste by one another.
{5:16} And I say, Walk in Spirit, and complete not the desire of the flesh.
{5:17} For the flesh desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are adverse to one another: that not the things ye would, these should ye do.
{5:18} And if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
{5:19} And the works of the flesh are manifest, which are; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness,
{5:20} Idolatry, charm, enmities, strifes, jealousies, wraths, intriguings, seditions, sects.
{5:21} Envyings, slaughters, drunkenness, revelries, and the like: to these which I foretell you, as I have also said before, that they doing such shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
{5:22} And the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith,
{5:23} Meekness, temperance: against such is no law.
{5:24} And they of Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and desires.
{5:25} If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
{5:26} Let us not be vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.
{6:1} Brethren, if a man be taken in any fault, ye the spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; observing thyself narrowly, lest thou also be tempted.
{6:2} Bear one another's burdens, and so fill up the law of Christ:
{6:3} For if any think to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself.
{6:4} And let each try his own work, and then in himself alone will he have boasting, and not in another.
{6:5} For each shall bear his own load.
{6:6} Let him being taught the word participate with him teaching in all good things.
{6:7} Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man should sow, that also shall he reap.
{6:8} For he sowing to his flesh of the flesh shall reap corruption; but he sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap eternal life.
{6:9} And doing good let us not despond: for in proper time we shall reap, not being enervated.
{6:10} Wherefore then as we have time, let us work good to all, and chiefly to them of the household of faith.
{6:11} See ye how large letters I wrote to you with mine own hand.
{6:12} As many as: wish to have an agreeable demeanor in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only lest they should be driven out for the cross of Christ.
{6:13} For neither they being circumcised themselves observe the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, that they might boast in your flesh.
{6:14} And it may not be to me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.
{6:15} For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any power, nor uncircumcision but a new creation.
{6:16} And as many as walk by this model, place upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
{6:17} For the rest let none cause me fatigues: for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus Christ in my body.
{6:18} The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
