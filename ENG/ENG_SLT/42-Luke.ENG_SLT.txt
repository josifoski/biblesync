{1:1} Since many have undertaken to arrange the narration concerning things rendered perfectly certain among us,
{1:2} As they delivered to us, who from the beginning being eyewitnesses, and servants of the word;
{1:3} It seemed fitting to me also, having comprehended all things thoroughly from above, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,
{1:4} That thou mightest know the certainty of the words concerning which thou hast been instructed.
{1:5} There was in the days of Herod, king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the daily order of Abia: and his wife the daughter of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.
{1:6} And they were both just before God, going faultless in all the commands and precepts of the Lord.
{1:7} And no child was to them, as Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in their days.
{1:8} And it was in his being priest, in the arranging of the daily order before God,
{1:9} According to the custom of the priesthood, he drew lots to burn incense, having entered into the temple of the Lord.
{1:10} And all the multitude of people were praying without at the hour of incense.
{1:11} And a messenger of the Lord was seen to him, standing from the right of the altar of fumigation.
{1:12} And Zacharias having seen, was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
{1:13} And the messenger said to him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy supplication has been heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
{1:14} And joy shall be to thee, and gladness: and many shall rejoice at his birth.
{1:15} For he shall be great before the Lord, and wine and fermented liquor he should not drink; and with the Holy Spirit shall he be filled, even from his mother's womb.
{1:16} And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn back to the Lord their God.
{1:17} And he shall come before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn back the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the intelligence of the just; to prepare a people having been put in order for the Lord.
{1:18} And Zacharias said to the messenger, By what shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife advanced in her days.
{1:19} The messenger having answered, said to him, I am Gabriel, standing before God; and was sent to speak to thee, and announce these good news to thee.
{1:20} And, behold, thou shalt be silent, and not able to speak, till the day in which these things shall be, because thou didst not believe my words, which shall be completed in their time.
{1:21} And the people were expecting Zacharias, and wondered at his tarrying in the temple.
{1:22} And having come out, he could not speak to them: and they knew that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he was nodding to them, and remained dumb.
{1:23} And it was when the days of his service were filled, he departed to his house.
{1:24} And after these days Elizabeth his wife conceived, and concealed herself five months, saying,
{1:25} That so has the Lord done to me in days which he looked upon, to take away my reproach among men.
{1:26} And in the sixth month the messenger Gabriel was sent by God into a city of Galilee, to which the name Nazareth,
{1:27} To a virgin betrothed to a man to whom the name of Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name Mary.
{1:28} And the messenger, having come in to her said, Hail, thou made acceptable; the Lord with thee: praised thou among women.
{1:29} And having seen him, she was troubled at his words, and turned in her thoughts of what country this greeting might be.
{1:30} And the messenger said to her, Fear not, Mary: thou hast found grace with God.
{1:31} And, behold, thou shalt conceive in the womb, and shalt bear a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS.
{1:32} He shall be great, and he shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father:
{1:33} And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
{1:34} And Mary said to the messenger, How shall this be, since I. know not man?
{1:35} And the messenger having answered, said to her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: wherefore also the holy thing born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
{1:36} And, behold, Elizabeth thy kinsman, she also having conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month to her, called barren.
{1:37} For nothing shall be impossible with God.
{1:38} And Mary said Behold the servant of the Lord; may it be to me according to thy word. And the messenger departed from her.
{1:39} And Mary having risen in those days, went into the mountainous country with haste, into a city of Judah;
{1:40} And she entered into the house of Zacharias, and greeted Elizabeth.
{1:41} And it was when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit:
{1:42} And she called out with a great voice, and said, Praised thou among women, and praised the fruit of thy womb.
{1:43} And whence this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
{1:44} For, behold, when the voice of thy greeting was in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
{1:45} And happy she having believed: for a completion of the things spoken shall be to her from the Lord.
{1:46} And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord.
{1:47} And my Spirit rejoiced in God my Saviour.
{1:48} For he looked upon the humiliation of his servant; for, behold, from now shall all generations deem me happy.
{1:49} For the powerful one has done great things for me; and his name holy.
{1:50} And his mercy to generations of generations to those fearing him.
{1:51} He has done strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thought of their heart.
{1:52} He has pulled down the powerful from thrones, and lifted up the.
{1:53} He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he sent away empty.
{1:54} He succored Israel his servant, remembering mercy;
{1:55} As he spake to our fathers, to Abram, and his seed forever.
{1:56} And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.
{1:57} And the time was completed to Elizabeth, for her to bring forth; and she brought forth a son.
{1:58} And they dwelling near and her kinsmen heard, for the Lord magnified his mercy with her; and they rejoiced with her.
{1:59} And it was in the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him by the name of his father Zacharias.
{1:60} And his mother, having answered said, Nay; but he shall be called John.
{1:61} And they said to her, That there is none among thy kindred who is called by this name.
{1:62} And they nodded to his father, what he may wish to have him called.
{1:63} And having asked for a small writing tablet, he wrote, saying, John is his name. And they all wondered.
{1:64} And his month was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spake, praising God.
{1:65} And fear was upon all dwelling round about them: and in all the mount of Judea all these words were discoursed about.
{1:66} And all having heard, set in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.
{1:67} And Zacharias his father, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
{1:68} Praised the Lord God of Israel; for he reviewed and he has made a redemption for his people,
{1:69} And he raised up a horn of salvation to us in the house of David, his servant;
{1:70} As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, from forever:
{1:71} Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all hating us;
{1:72} To do mercy with our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant:
{1:73} The oath which he sware to Abraham our father,
{1:74} To give to us, fearlessly, delivered from the hands of our enemies,
{1:75} To serve him in sanctity and justice before him all the days of our life.
{1:76} And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;
{1:77} To give knowledge of salvation to his people, in remission of their sins.
{1:78} Through the bowels of mercy of our God; by which the rising of the sun of sublimity has reviewed us,
{1:79} To shine forth to those in darkness and sitting in the shadow of death, to direct our feet in the way of peace.
{1:80} And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit, and he was in the deserts till the day of his shewing forth to Israel.
{2:1} And it was in those days an order came out from Caesar Angustus, for the whole habitable globe to be enrolled.
{2:2} (This enrolling was first, Cyrenius being leader of Syria.)
{2:3} And all went to be enrolled, each in his own city.
{2:4} And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (for he was of the house and family of David:)
{2:5} To be enrolled with Mary his betrothed wife, being pregnant.
{2:6} And it was in their being there, the days were completed for her to bring forth.
{2:7} And she brought forth her firstborn son, and swathed him, and put him in a manger; for there was no place for them in the inn.
{2:8} And shepherds were in the country, sleeping in the fields, and watching over their flock the watches of the night.
{2:9} And, behold, a messenger of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them: and they fear a great fear.
{2:10} And the messenger said to them, Fear not: for, behold, I announce you good news, great joy, which shall be to all people.
{2:11} For this day a Saviour was born to you, who is Christ the Lord, in the city of David.
{2:12} And this the sign to you; ye shall find the babe swathed, lying in a manger.
{2:13} And suddenly was there a multitude with the messenger of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,
{2:14} Glory to God in the highest ones, and upon earth peace, benevolence in men.
{2:15} And it was when the messenger departed from them into heaven, and the men, the shepherds, said to one another, Let us pass through now to Bethlehem, and see this word done, which the Lord made known to us.
{2:16} And having hastened, they came and found both Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.
{2:17} And having seen, they made known concerning the word spoken to them about the child.
{2:18} And all having heard wondered at the things spoken to them by the shepherds.
{2:19} And Mary kept together all these sayings, reflecting in her heart.
{2:20} And the shepherds returned, honouring and praising God for all which they heard and saw, as was spoken to them.
{2:21} And when eight days were completed for circumcising the child and his name was called JESUS, called by the messenger before he was conceived in the womb.
{2:22} And when the days of her cleansing were completed, according to the law of Moses, they brought him to Jerusalem to present to the Lord;
{2:23} (As has been written in the law of the Lord, That every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)
{2:24} And to give a sacrifice according to that said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves, or two of the young of pigeons.
{2:25} And, behold, a man was in Jerusalem, the name to him Simeon; and this man just and cautious, waiting the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
{2:26} And it was intimated to him by the Holy Spirit, not to see death, before he should see the Christ of the Lord.
{2:27} And he came in the Spirit to the temple: and in the parents bringing in the child Jesus, for them to do according to the custom of the law for him,
{2:28} And he took him into his arms, and praised God, and said:
{2:29} Now Lord, thou wilt loose thy servant, according to thy word, in peace:
{2:30} For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
{2:31} Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples:
{2:32} A light for the revelation of the nations, and the glory of thy people Israel.
{2:33} And Joseph and his mother were wondering at the things spoken of him.
{2:34} And Simeon praised them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, he is laid for the fall and rising up of many in Israel; and for a sign spoken against;
{2:35} And also a spear shall pass through the soul of thyself,) so that "the reasonings from many hearts might be revealed.
{2:36} And Anna was a prophetess, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she advanced in many days, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;
{2:37} And she a widow of about eighty-four years, who departed not from the temple, with fastings and supplications serving night and day.
{2:38} And she having stood at that hour, confessed to the Lord, and spake concerning him to all awaiting redemption in Jerusalem.
{2:39} And when they finished all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee to their city, Nazareth.
{2:40} And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit, being filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
{2:41} And his parents went every year to Jerusalem to the festival of the passover.
{2:42} And when he was of twelve years, they having gone up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the festival:
{2:43} And having completed the days, in their returning the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not.
{2:44} And they, having supposed him to be in the caravan, came the way of a day, and sought him among kinsmen and among acquaintances.
{2:45} And not having found him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.
{2:46} And it was after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of teachers, and hearing them, and inquiring of them.
{2:47} And all hearing him were affected in mind at his understanding and answers.
{2:48} And having seen him, they were struck with awe: and his mother said to him, Child, why didst thou so to us? behold, thy father and I, grieving, have sought thee.
{2:49} And he said to them, For what have ye sought me? knew ye not that among the things of my Father I must be?
{2:50} And they understood not the word which he spake to them.
{2:51} And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was placed under them: and his mother kept all these words in her heart.
{2:52} And Jesus advanced in wisdom and age, and in grace with God and man.
{3:1} Know in the fifteenth year of the supremacy of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being leader of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother being tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,
{3:2} Upon Annas and Caiaphas being chief priests, the word of God was upon John, son of Zacharias in the desert.
{3:3} And he came into all the country round about Jordan, proclaiming the immersion of repentance for remission of sins;
{3:4} As it has been written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, A voice of him crying in the desert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his footpaths straight.
{3:5} Every ravine shall be filled up, and every mount and hill shall be lowered; and the crooked shall be into straightness, and the rough into smooth ways.
{3:6} And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
{3:7} Then said he to the crowds coming out to be immersed by him, Generation of vipers, who indicated to you to flee from the anger about to come?
{3:8} Do ye therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say in yourselves, We have a father Abraham: for I say to you, That God is able to raise children to Abraham of these stones.
{3:9} And also the axe is already laid at the root of the trees: therefore every tree not making good fruit is cut down, and cast into fire.
{3:10} And the crowds asked him, saying, What therefore shall we do?
{3:11} And he having answered, says to them, He having two coats, let him impart to him having none; and he having food, let him do likewise.
{3:12} And publicans came to be immersed, and said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?
{3:13} And he said to them, Do nothing more than that appointed you.
{3:14} And they making war asked him, saying, And what shall do? And he said to them, Shake none violently, neither make slanderous accusation; and be content with your pay.
{3:15} And the people awaiting, and all reasoning in their hearts concerning John, whether he may not be the Christ;
{3:16} John answered to all, saying, I truly immerse you with water; and he stronger than I comes, of whom I am not worthy to loose his shoes' strings: he shall immerse you with the Holy Spirit and fire:
{3:17} Whose winnowing fan in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor, and gather the wheat into his store; and the chaff he will burn down with inextinguishable fire.
{3:18} And then truly many other things beseeching, he evangelized the people.
{3:19} And Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod did,
{3:20} And he added this to all, and shut up John in prison.
{3:21} And it was in all the people having been immersed, and Jesus having been immersed, and praying, heaven was opened,
{3:22} And the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove upon him, and there was a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my dearly loved Son; in thee I was contented.
{3:23} And Jesus himself was beginning about thirty years, being, as was thought, the son of Joseph, of Eli,
{3:24} Of Matthat, of Levi, of Melchi, of Janna, of Joseph,
{3:25} Of Mattathias, of Amos, of Naum, of Esli, of Naggai,
{3:26} Of Maath, of Mattathias, of Semei, of Joseph, of Juda,
{3:27} Of Joanna, of Rhesa, of Zorobabel, of Salathiel, of Neri,
{3:28} Of Melchi, of Addi, of Cosam, of Elmodam, of Er,
{3:29} Of Jose, of Eliezer, of Jorim, of Matthat, of Levi,
{3:30} Of Simeon, of Juda, of Joseph, of Jonan, of Eliakim,
{3:31} Of Melea, of Menan, of Mattatha, of Nathan, of David,
{3:32} Of Jesse, of Obed, of Booz, of Salmon, of Naasson,
{3:33} Of Aminadab, of Aram, of Esrom, of Phares, of Juda,
{3:34} Of Jacob, of Isaac, of Abraham, of Thara, of Nachor,
{3:35} Of Saruch, of Ragau, of Phalec, of Eber, of Sala,
{3:36} Of Cainan, of Arphaxad, of Sem, of Noe, of Lamech,
{3:37} Of Mathusala, of Enoch, of Jared, of Maleleel, of Cainan,
{3:38} Of Enos, of Seth, of Adam, of God.
{4:1} And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, turned back from Jordan, and was led by the Holy Spirit into the desert,
{4:2} Being tempted forty days by the devil. And he ate nothing in those days: and they having ended, he afterward hungered.
{4:3} And the devil said to him, If thou art the Son of God, say thou to this stone that it might be bread.
{4:4} And Jesus answered to him saying, It has been written, That not by bread alone shall man live, but by every word of God.
{4:5} And the devil, bringing him into a high mountain, shewed him all the kingdoms of the habitable globe in an instant of time.
{4:6} And the devil said to him, I will give thee all this power, and their glory; for to me has it been delivered; and to whom I will I give it.
{4:7} Therefore if thou worship before me, all shall be thine.
{4:8} And having answered him Jesus said, Retire behind me, Satan: for it has been written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
{4:9} And he brought him to Jerusalem and set him upon the small wing of the temple, and said to him, If thou art the Son of God; cast thyself down from hence:
{4:10} For it has been written, That he shall charge his messengers concerning thee, to watch over thee:
{4:11} And upon hands shall they lift thee up, lest that perhaps thou shouldest strike thy foot against a stone.
{4:12} And Jesus having answered said to him, That it has been said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
{4:13} And having ended all the trial, the devil departed from him for a time.
{4:14} And Jesus turned back in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and a rumor went out concerning him through the whole country round about.
{4:15} And he taught in their assemblies, being honoured of all.
{4:16} And he came to Nazareth where he was brought up, and he went in, as was the custom to him in the day of the sabbaths, into the assembly, and stood up to read.
{4:17} And the book of Esaias the prophet was given to him. And having unfolded the book, he found the place where it was written,
{4:18} The Spirit of the Lord is upon me for which he anointed me to announce good news to the poor; he has sent me to heal the broken in heart, to proclaim a remission to the captives, and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send away with remission the bruised,
{4:19} To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.
{4:20} And having folded the book and given back to the servant, he sat down. And the eyes of all in the assembly were looking attentively upon him.
{4:21} And he began to say to them, That this day has this writing been filled up in your ears.
{4:22} And all bore him testimony and wondered at the words of grace going out of his mouth: and said, Is not this the son of Joseph
{4:23} And he said to them, Directly will ye say to me this proverb, Physician, cure thyself: what things we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.
{4:24} And he said; Truly I say to you, That not any prophet is accepted in his country.
{4:25} And I tell you of a truth, many widows were in the days of Elias in Israel, When heaven was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine Was upon all the land;
{4:26} And to none of them was Elias sent, except to Sarepta, of Sidon, to a widow woman.
{4:27} And many leprous were during Eliseus the prophet in Israel; and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.
{4:28} And all in the assembly were filled with wrath, hearing these things,
{4:29} And having risen up, they cast him without the city, and they brought him to the brow of the mount upon which their city was built, to hurt him down.
{4:30} And he having passed through the midst of them, went away.
{4:31} And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and he was teaching them on the sabbaths.
{4:32} And they were struck with amazement at his teaching: for his word was with power.
{4:33} And in the assembly was a man having the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a great voice,
{4:34} Saying, Let alone; what to us and thee, Jesus Nazarene? hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy of God.
{4:35} And Jesus answered him, saying, Be then silent, and come Out of him. And the demon having thrown him into the midst, came out of him, not having injured him.
{4:36} And amazement was upon all, and they spake to one another, saying, What this word with authority and power he commands unclean spirits, and they come out.
{4:37} And a report went forth concerning him into every place of the country round about.
{4:38} And having risen from the assembly, he went into Simon's house. And Simon's mother-in-law was taken with a great fever; and they entreated him for her.
{4:39} And having stood over her, he censured the fever: and it left her: and having risen immediately she served them.
{4:40} And the sun setting, all as many as had sick ones with various diseases brought them to him; and he having put hands upon each one of them, cured them.
{4:41} And demons came out of many, crying, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And answering he suffered them not to speak, for they knew him to be Christ.
{4:42} And it having been day, having gone forth he went into a deserted place: and the crowds sought him, and came to him, and detained him not to go from them.
{4:43} And he said to them, That also to other cities must I announce the good news, the kingdom of God: because for this have I been sent.
{4:44} And he was proclaiming in the assemblies of Galilee.
{5:1} And it was the crowd pressing close upon him to hear the word of God, and he was standing near the lake of Gennesaret,
{5:2} And he saw two ships standing near the lake: and the fishermen having gone out of them, washed the fishing-nets.
{5:3} And having gone into one of the ships, which was Simon's, he asked him to sail out a little from land. And having sat down, he taught the crowds out of the ship.
{5:4} And when he ceased speaking, he said to Simon, Sail out into the deep, and slacken your nets for fishing.
{5:5} And Simon having answered, said to him, Commander, wearied for the whole night, we took nothing: but at thy word I will slacken the net.
{5:6} And having done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net broke through;
{5:7} And they nodded to partners, those in the other ship, that having come they should succor them. And they came and filled both ships, so that they were sinking.
{5:8} And Simon Peter fell upon his knees before Jesus, saying, Go out from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
{5:9} For amazement held him, and all those with him, at the fishing of the fishes which they took:
{5:10} And likewise also James and John, Zebedee's sons, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not; from now thou shalt be capturing men.
{5:11} And having brought down the ship upon the land, having let go all things, they followed him.
{5:12} And it was in his being in one of the cities, and behold a man full of leprosy: and having seen Jesus, having fallen upon the face, supplicated him, saying, Lord, if thou wouldst, thou canst cleanse me.
{5:13} And having put forth the hand, he touched him, saying, I will: be thou cleansed. And the leprosy departed from him.
{5:14} And he enjoined him to tell none: but having departed, show thyself to the priest, and bring near for thy cleansing as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
{5:15} But the more the word passed through concerning him: and many crowds came together to hear, anti to be cured from their weaknesses.
{5:16} And he was retreating into the deserts, and praying.
{5:17} And it was in one of the days, and he was teaching, and the Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting, who were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was for healing them.
{5:18} And, behold, men bringing upon a bed a man who was affected with paralysis; and they sought to bring him, and set before him.
{5:19} And not finding how they might bring him in, for the crowd, having ascended upon the house, they put him down through the tiles, with the small couch, in the midst before Jesus.
{5:20} And having seen their faith, he said to him, Man, thy sins are remitted to thee.
{5:21} And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason with themselves, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can remit sins but God alone?
{5:22} And Jesus having known their reflections, having answered, said to them, What do ye reason with yourselves in your hearts?
{5:23} Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are remitted to thee; or to say, Arise and walk?
{5:24} And that ye might know that the Son of man has power upon earth to remit sins, (he said to him affected with paralysis,) I say to thee, Arise, and having taken up thy conch, go into thy house.
{5:25} And immediately having risen before them, having taken up on what he lay, he went away to his house, honouring God.
{5:26} And amazement took them all, and they honoured God, and were filled with fear, saying, That we have seen wonderful things to day.
{5:27} And after these, he went out, and saw a publican, by name Levi, sitting by the custom-house; and he said to him, Follow me.
{5:28} And having left all, having risen, he followed him.
{5:29} And Levi made a great entertainment for him in his house: and there was a great crowd of publicans and others who were sitting down with them.
{5:30} And the scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Wherefore eat and drink ye with publicans and sinful?
{5:31} And Jesus, having answered, said to them, Those being in good health have no need of a physician; but they being ill.
{5:32} I came not to call the just, but the sinful to repentance.
{5:33} And they said to him, Wherefore do the disciples of John fast frequently, and make prayers, and likewise they of the Pharisees; and they to thee eat and drink.
{5:34} And he said to them, Ye cannot make the sons of the nuptial chamber fast, when the bridegroom is with them.
{5:35} But the days will come also, when the bridegroom shall be carried away from them; then shall they fast in those days.
{5:36} And he also spake to them a parable; That none put a piece of new garment, upon an old garment; and if not so, the new also splits, and the piece from the new agrees not with the old.
{5:37} And none put new wine into old wine-skins; and if not so, the new wine bursts the wine-skins, and it will be poured out, and the wine-skins will perish.
{5:38} But new wine cast into new wine-skins; and both are kept.
{5:39} And none drinking old, quickly desires new, for he says, The old is better.
{6:1} And it was in the second first sabbath, he went through the standing corn; and his disciples pulled out the ears of corn, and ate, crumbling in small pieces with hands.
{6:2} And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do ye what is not lawful to do in the sabbaths.
{6:3} And having answered to them, Jesus said, Have ye not read this, which David did when he hungered, and they being with him;
{6:4} How he went into the house of God, and took the loaves of the setting before, and ate, and gave also to those with him; which is not lawful to eat, except for priests alone?
{6:5} And he said to them, The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
{6:6} And it was also in another sabbath, he came into the assembly, and taught: and a man was there, and his right hand was withered.
{6:7} And the scribes and Pharisees observed him narrowly, if he will heal in the sabbath: that they might find accusation against him.
{6:8} And he knew their reflections, and said to the man having the withered hand, Arise, and stand in the midst. And having risen, he stood.
{6:9} Then said Jesus to them, I will ask you; What is lawful in the sabbath; to do good, or to do evil? to save the life, or destroy.
{6:10} And having looked round upon them all, he said to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
{6:11} And they were filled with want of understanding; and they discoursed with one another What they may do to Jesus.
{6:12} And it was in those days, he went out to the mount to pray, and he was passing the whole night in prayer to God.
{6:13} And when it was day, he called to his disciples: and having chosen twelve from them, and he named them, the sent;
{6:14} Simon, (and he named him Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
{6:15} Matthew and Thomas, James, him of Alpheus, and Simon called Zelotes,
{6:16} Judas, of James, and Judas Iscariot, and he was the traitor.
{6:17} And having come down with them, he stood upon a level place, and a crowd of his disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the maritime country of Tyre and Sidon, they also came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;
{6:18} And those molested with unclean spirits: and they were cured.
{6:19} And all the crowd sought to touch him; for there came forth power from him, and healed all.
{6:20} And he having lifted up his eyes upon his disciples, said, Happy the poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
{6:21} Happy the hungering now: for ye shall be satisfied. Happy the weeping now: for ye shall laugh.
{6:22} Happy are ye, when men hate you, and when they separate you, and reproach, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.
{6:23} Rejoice in that day, and skip: for, behold, your reward much in heaven: for according to these did their fathers to the prophets.
{6:24} But woe to you rich for ye take away your consolation.
{6:25} Woe to you having been filled for ye shall hunger. Woe to you laughing now! for ye shall grieve and weep.
{6:26} Woe to you when all men speak well of you! for according to these did their fathers to the false prophets.
{6:27} But I say to you hearing, Love your enemies; do good to those hating you,
{6:28} Praise those cursing you, and pray for those threatening you.
{6:29} To him striking thee upon the cheek hold also near the other; and from him taking away thy garments, and thou shouldest not retrench thy coat.
{6:30} And to every one asking thee, do thou give; and from him taking away thy things, re-demand not.
{6:31} And as ye wish that men would do to you, and do you to them likewise.
{6:32} And if ye love them loving you, what grace is to you? for also the sinful would love those loving them.
{6:33} And if ye do good to those doing good to you, what grace is to you? for also the sinful do the same.
{6:34} And if ye lend of whom ye hope to receive back, what grace is to you? for also the sinful lend to the sinful, that they might receive back the like things.
{6:35} But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing back; and your reward shall be much, and ye shall be sons of the Highest; for he is kind to the graceless and evil.
{6:36} Be ye therefore compassionate, as also your Father is compassionate.
{6:37} And judge not, and ye should not be judged: condemn not, and ye should not be condemned: loose ye, and ye shall be loosed.
{6:38} Give, and it shall be given you; good measure, yielded, and shaken, and overflowed, shall they give into your bosom: for with the same measure that ye measure, shall it be measured back to you.
{6:39} And he spake to them a parable, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?
{6:40} For the learner is not above his teacher: and every one set in order shall be as his teacher.
{6:41} And why beholdest thou the dried straw in thy brother's eye, and perceivest not the beam in thine own eye?
{6:42} Or how Canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, suffer that I cast out the mote in thine eye, thyself not beholding the beam in thine eye? O hypocrite, cast out first the beam from thine own eye, and then shalt thou see through to cast out the mote in thy brother's eye.
{6:43} For it is not a good tree making decayed fruit; neither a decayed tree making good fruit.
{6:44} For each tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns they gather not figs, nor of the bramble do they harvest the grape.
{6:45} The good man out of the good treasure of his heart, brings forward the good thing; and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart, brings forward the evil thing: for out of the abundance of the heart does his month speak.
{6:46} And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not what I say?
{6:47} Every one coming to me, and hearing my words, and doing them, I will shew you to whom he is like:
{6:48} He is like to a man building a house, who digged, and deepened, and set the foundation upon the rock: and there having been an overflow, the river dashed against that house, and was not able to move it: for it was founded upon the rock.
{6:49} And he having heard, and not having done, is like a man having built a house upon the earth, without a foundation; against which the river dashed, and immediately it fell; and the breaking of that house was great.
{7:1} And when he completed all his words in the ears of the people, he came to Capernaum.
{7:2} And a certain centurion's servant being sick, was about to die; which was highly valued by him.
{7:3} And having heard of Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to him, asking him, that having come, he would save his servant.
{7:4} And they approaching to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying, That he is worthy to whom he will bestow this:
{7:5} For he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue.
{7:6} And Jesus went with them. And now he being away not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not fit that thou shouldest come under my roof;
{7:7} Therefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee: but speak in a word, and my servant shall be healed.
{7:8} For I also am a man set under authority, having soldiers under myself, and I say to this, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes: and to my servant, Do this, and he does.
{7:9} And Jesus having heard these, wondered at him, and having turned to the crowd following him, he said, I say to you, Neither have I found so much faith in Israel.
{7:10} And those sent, having turned back to the house, found the servant being sick, restored to health.
{7:11} And it was in continuation he went to a city called Nain; and sufficient of his disciples went with him, and a great crowd.
{7:12} And as he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, he dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she a widow; and a sufficient crowd of the city was with her.
{7:13} And having seen her, the Lord felt compassion for her and said to her, Weep not.
{7:14} And having come, he touched the coffin, and they bearing stood. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, arise.
{7:15} And the dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
{7:16} And fear took all; and they praised God, saying, That a great prophet has risen up among us; and That God has reviewed his people.
{7:17} And this word went out about him in all Judea, and in all the country round about.
{7:18} And John's disciples announced to him of all these things.
{7:19} And having called certain two of his disciples, John sent to Jesus, saying, Art thou he coming? or should we expect another?
{7:20} And the men, having approached to him, said, John the Immerser has sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he coming? or should we expect another?
{7:21} And in that same hour he cured many of diseases, and scourges, and evil spirits, and to many blind he conferred the favor to see.
{7:22} And Jesus having answered said to them, Having gone, announce to John what ye saw and heard; for the blind look up, the lame walk, the leprous are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor are announced good news.
{7:23} And happy is he, whoever should not be offended in me.
{7:24} And the messengers of John having departed, he began to say to the crowds concerning John, What went ye forth into the desert to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
{7:25} But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold, those in glorious clothing, and being in luxury, are in royal abodes.
{7:26} But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, superior to a prophet.
{7:27} This is he of whom it has been written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
{7:28} For I say to you, Among the begotten of women none is a greater prophet than John the Immerser; and the less in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
{7:29} And all the people having heard, and the publicans, justified God, having been immersed with the immersion of John.
{7:30} And the Pharisees, and they pertaining to the law, rejected the counsel of God against themselves, not immersed by him.
{7:31} And the Lord said, To whom shall I liken the men of this generation? and to whom are they like?
{7:32} They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling to one another, and saying, We played the flute to you, and ye danced not; we lamented to you, and ye wept not.
{7:33} For John the Immerser came, neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and ye say, He has a demon.
{7:34} The Son of man came eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a man, a glutton, and wine-drinker, a friend of publicans and sinful.
{7:35} And wisdom was justified of all her children.
{7:36} And a certain one of the Pharisees asked him that he would eat with him. And having come into the Pharisee's house, he reclined.
{7:37} And, behold, a woman in the city, who was sinful, knowing that he is reclining at table in the Pharisee's house, having brought an alabaster box of perfumed oil,
{7:38} And stood at his feet behind, weeping, been to wet his feet with tears, and wiped with the hairs of her head; and she kissed his feet, and anointed with the perfumed oil.
{7:39} And the Pharisee having called him, seeing, said within himself, This, if he were a prophet, had known who and what race of woman which had touched him: for she is sinful.
{7:40} And Jesus having answered, said to him, Simon, I have something to say to thee. And he says, Teacher, speak.
{7:41} Two debtors were to a certain money-lender: one owed five hundred drachmas, and the other fifty.
{7:42} And they not having to pay, he bestowed as a gift upon both. Which of them therefore will love him the more? Say thou.
{7:43} And Simon, having answered, said, I suppose, that to whom he bestowed more favor. And he said to him, Thou hast judged rightly,
{7:44} And having turned to the woman, he said to Simon, Thou seest this woman? I came into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: and she wet my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.
{7:45} Thou gavest me no kiss: and she from when I came in left not kissing my feet.
{7:46} Thou anointedst not my head with oil: and she anointed my feet with perfumed oil.
{7:47} For which I say to thee, Her many sins are remitted; for she loved much: and he to whom little is remitted, loves little.
{7:48} And he said to her, Thy sins are remitted.
{7:49} And they reclining together began to say in themselves, Who is this who also remits sins?
{7:50} And he said to the woman, Thy faith has saved thee; go in peace.
{8:1} And it was afterwards, and he passed through city and town proclaiming and announcing good news, the kingdom of God; and the twelve with him,
{8:2} And certain women, who were cured from evil spirits and weaknesses, Mary called Magdalene, from whom went forth seven demons,
{8:3} And Joanna wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who served him from possessions to them.
{8:4} And a great crowd being together, and coming to him in the city, he spake by a parable:
{8:5} The sower went out to sow his seed; and in his sowing, some truly fell by the way, and was trodden down, and the fowls of heaven devoured it.
{8:6} And other fell upon a rock; and having brought forth, was dried up, for it had no moisture.
{8:7} And other fell in the midst of thorns; and the thorns grew together and choked it.
{8:8} And other fell upon good earth; and having brought forth, made fruit, a hundredfold. Saying these, he called out, He having ears to hear, let him hear.
{8:9} And his disciples asked him, saying, What may this parable be?
{8:10} And he said, To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: and to the rest in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.
{8:11} And this is the parable: The seed is the word of God.
{8:12} And they by the way are they hearing; then comes the devil, and takes away the word from their heart, lest having believed, they should be saved.
{8:13} And they upon the rock, who, when they hear, with joy receive the word; and they have no root, who for a time believe, and in time of trial fly away.
{8:14} And that having fallen into thorns, and they are they having heard, and with cares and riches, and pleasures of life going forth, are choked, and bring not to maturity.
{8:15} And that in the good earth, they are they which, in a fair and good heart, having heard, keep the word, and bring forth fruit with patience.
{8:16} None, having lighted a light, covers it with a vessel, or puts under a bed; but sets upon a candlestick, that they entering might see the light.
{8:17} For there is nothing hid, which should not be made manifest; nor concealed, which should not be made known, and come clear.
{8:18} See therefore how ye hear: for whoever should have, shall be given him; and whoever should not have, and what he seems to have shall be taken away from him.
{8:19} And his mother and brethren approached to him; and they could not come to him for the crowd.
{8:20} And it was announced to him, saying, Thy mother and thy brethren have stood without, wishing to see thee.
{8:21} And he having answered, said unto them, My mother and my brethren are they hearing the word of God, and doing it.
{8:22} And it was in one of the days, and he went into a ship, and his disciples: and he said to them, Let us pass through to the other side of the lake. And they led forth.
{8:23} And they sailing, he fell asleep: and a hurricane of wind came down upon the lake; and they were filled, and were in peril.
{8:24} And having come near, they awoke him, saying, Ruler ruler, we perish. And having risen, he censured the wind and heaving of water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.
{8:25} And he said to them, Where is your faith And having feared, they wondered, saying to one another, Who then is this! that also commands the winds and the waters, and they listen to him!
{8:26} And they sailed over to the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.
{8:27} And he coming upon land, a certain man met him from the city, who had demons of long times, and put on no garment, and abode not in a house, but in the tombs.
{8:28} And having seen Jesus and cried out, he fell before him, and with a great voice said, What to me and thee, Jesus, Son of God most high? I implore thee, thou wouldst not torment me.
{8:29} For he proclaimed to the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it snatched him: and he was bound with chains, and being guarded with fetters; and bursting the bonds, he was driven by the demon into the deserts.
{8:30} And Jesus asked him, saying, What is the name to thee? And he said, Legion: for many demons came into him.
{8:31} And he besought him that he would not command him to go away into the abyss.
{8:32} And a herd of numerous swine was there feeding on the mount: and they besought him that he would permit them to come into the swine. And he permitted them.
{8:33} And the demons having come out of the man, came into the swine: and the herd rushed down the precipice into the lake, and were choked.
{8:34} And they feeding, having seen that done, fled, and having departed, proclaimed in the city and in the fields.
{8:35} And they went out to see that done; and came to Jesus, and they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting clothed, and being of sound mind, at the feet of Jesus; and they were afraid.
{8:36} And they, having seen, proclaimed to them how he possessed with a demon was saved.
{8:37} And all the multitude of the country round about, of the Gadarenes, asked him to depart from them; for they were held fast by great fear: and he having gone into the ship, returned.
{8:38} And the man from whom the demons had gone out implored him to be with him: and Jesus loosed him, saying,
{8:39} Return to thy house and recount what God did to thee. And he departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city what Jesus did to him.
{8:40} And it was in Jesus' returning, the crowd received him; for all were expecting him.
{8:41} And, behold, a man came, to whom the name of Jairus, and he was ruler of the assembly: and having fallen before the feet of Jesus, he besought him to come to his house:
{8:42} For an only daughter was to him, of about twelve years, and she was dying. And in his going the crowds pressed him.
{8:43} And a woman being in a flowing of blood for twelve years, who having expended all the means of subsistence upon physicians, could not be cured by any.
{8:44} Having come near behind, touched the hem of his garment: and immediately her flow of blood was stopped.
{8:45} And Jesus said; Who having touched me? And all denying, Peter said, and they with him: Ruler, the crowds hold with thee and press thee, and thou sayest, Who having touched me?
{8:46} And Jesus said, Somebody touched me: for I know power having gone out from me.
{8:47} And the woman having seen that she was not hid, came trembling, and having fallen before him, announced to him before all people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
{8:48} And he said to her. Take courage, Daughter: thy faith has saved thee; go in peace.
{8:49} He yet speaking, there comes a certain of the ruler of the assembly, saying to him, That thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.
{8:50} And Jesus having heard, answered him, saying, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be saved.
{8:51} And having come into the house, he suffered not any to come in, except Peter, and James, and John, and the father and mother of the child.
{8:52} And all wept, and bewailed her: and he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeping.
{8:53} And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.
{8:54} And he having cast all without, and held firmly her hand, called, saying, Child, arise.
{8:55} And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately: and he ordered to give her to eat.
{8:56} And her parents were affected in mind: and he proclaimed to them, to tell no one that having been done.
{9:1} And having called together his twelve disciples, he gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
{9:2} And he sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God, and heal the sick.
{9:3} And he said to them, Take away nothing for the way, neither rods, nor wallet, nor bread, nor silver; nor to have two coats apiece.
{9:4} And into whatever house ye come in, remain there, and come out thence.
{9:5} And as many as should not receive you, having come out of that city, and shake off the cloud of dust from your feet for testimony against them.
{9:6} And having gone out, they went through the towns, proclaiming the good news, and healing every where.
{9:7} And Herod the tetrarch heard all done by him: and was in perplexity, for it was said by certain, that John had been raised from the dead.
{9:8} And by certain, that Elias has appeared; and by others, that a prophet, one of the ancients, was risen.
{9:9} And Herod said, John I beheaded and who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.
{9:10} And the sent, having returned, recounted to him what they did. And having taken them, he retreated apart in a desert place of the city, called Bethsaida.
{9:11} And the crowds having known, followed him: and having received them, he spake to them, of the kingdom of God, and healed them having need of cure.
{9:12} And the day began to decline: and the twelve having come near, said to him, Loose the crowd, that having departed into the towns round about and the fields, they might rest, and might find provisions; for here are we in a deserted place.
{9:13} And he said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, There are no more to us than five loaves and two fishes; except having gone we buy food for all this people.
{9:14} For they were about five thou sand men. And he said to his disciples, Place them reclining by fifty in a place for reposing.
{9:15} And they did so, and they made all recline.
{9:16} And having taken the five loaves and two fishes, having looked up to heaven, be praised them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the crowd.
{9:17} And they all ate, and were satisfied: and that over and above having remained to them was taken up, twelve baskets of fragments.
{9:18} And it was in his being alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom do the crowds say me to be?
{9:19} And they having answered, said, John the Immerser; and others, Elias; and others, that a certain prophet of the ancients has risen up.
{9:20} And he said to them, And whom say ye me to be? And Peter having answered said, The Christ of God.
{9:21} And he having censured them, enjoined them to tell this to no one;
{9:22} Saying, That the Son of man must suffer many things, and be disapproved of by the more ancient and the chief priests and the scribes, and be slain, and be raised up the third day.
{9:23} And he said to all, If any one wish to come after me, let him deny himself, and lift up his cross daily and let him follow me.
{9:24} For whoever would wish to save his soul shall lose it: and whoever should lose his soul for my sake, the same shall save it.
{9:25} For what is a man profited, having gained the whole world, and having lost himself, or having been damaged?
{9:26} For whoever should be ashamed of me and my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he should come in the glory of himself, and of the Father, and of the holy messengers.
{9:27} And I say to you truly, certain are standing here, who shall not taste of death, till they should see the kingdom of God.
{9:28} And it was after these words about eight days, and having taken Peter and John and James, he went up into the mount to pray.
{9:29} And it was in his praying, the look of his face was another, and his clothing white, shooting forth lightning.
{9:30} And, behold, two men were speaking with him, which were Moses and Elias:
{9:31} Who, having been seen in glory spake of his exit which he was about to complete in Jerusalem.
{9:32} And Peter and they with him were heavy with sleep: and having waked, they saw his glory, and two men standing with him.
{9:33} And it was in their having withdrawn from him, Peter said to Jesus, Ruler, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he says.
{9:34} And he saying these things, there was a cloud, and it overshadowed them: and they were afraid in their going into the cloud.
{9:35} And there was a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son: hear him.
{9:36} And in there having been a voice, Jesus was found alone. And they were silent, and announced nothing to any one in those days, of what they had seen.
{9:37} And it was in the day following, they having come down from the mountain, there met him a great crowd.
{9:38} And, behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, Teacher, I implore thee look upon my son: for he is my only born.
{9:39} And, behold, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries out; and it tears him with foam, and with difficulty withdraws from him, bruising him.
{9:40} And I implored thy disciples that they cast it out; and they could not.
{9:41} And Jesus having answered said, O faithless and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you, and endure you I Bring hither thy son.
{9:42} And he yet coming near, the demon rent him, and tare him. And Jesus censured the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and gave him back to his father.
{9:43} And all were struck with amazement at the majesty of God. And all wondering at all which he did, Jesus said to his disciples,
{9:44} Put ye these words into your ears: for the Son of man is about to be delivered up into the bands of men.
{9:45} And they knew not this word, and it was hid from them, lest they should understand it: and they feared to ask him concerning this word.
{9:46} And there came up a conference among them, thus, which of them should be the greatest.
{9:47} And Jesus, having seen the reflection of their heart, having taken up a child, set it by himself,
{9:48} And he said to them, Whoever should receive this child in my name receives me: and whoever should receive me, receives him having sent me: for he being less among you all, the same shall be great.
{9:49} And John having answered said, Ruler, we saw a certain one casting out demons in thy name; and we hindered him, because he follows not with us.
{9:50} And Jesus said, Hinder him not: for who is not against us is for us.
{9:51} And it was in the days of his acceptation being completed, and he fixed his face to go into Jerusalem.
{9:52} And he sent messengers before his face: and having gone, they came into a town of Samaritans, in order to prepare for him.
{9:53} And they received him not, for his face was going to Jerusalem.
{9:54} And his disciples James and John having seen, said, O Lord, wilt thou that we should speak fire to come down from heaven, and destroy them, as also did Elias?
{9:55} And having turned he censured them, and said, Ye know not of what sort of spirit ye are.
{9:56} For the Son of man came not to destroy men's souls, but to save them. And they proceeded into another town:
{9:57} And it was, they going in the way, a certain one said to him, I will follow thee wherever thou shouldest go forth, Lord.
{9:58} And Jesus said to him, Foxes have dens, and fowls of heaven encampments; but the Son of man has not where he might lay down the head.
{9:59} And he said to another, Follow me. And he said, Lord, permit me having gone, first to inter my father.
{9:60} And Jesus said to him, Permit the dead to inter their own dead; and thou, having gone, announce the kingdom of God.
{9:61} And another said, I will follow thee, Lord; and first permit me to take leave of those in my house.
{9:62} And Jesus said to him, No one putting his hand upon the plough, and looking back, is adapted to the kingdom of God.
{10:1} And after these the Lord showed forth other seventy, and sent them together two and two before his face into every city and place, where he was about to come.
{10:2} Then said he to them, Truly the harvest much, and the laborers few: implore therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.
{10:3} Retire: behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.
{10:4} Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor shoes: and greet none by the way.
{10:5} And in whatever house ye enter, first say, Peace to this house.
{10:6} And if truly the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: and if not so, it shall turn back to you.
{10:7} And remain in the same house, eating and drinking the things of them: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.
{10:8} And in whatever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat the things set before you.
{10:9} And cure the sick in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God has drawn near to you.
{10:10} And in whatever city ye enter, and they receive you not, having gone into its spacious ways, say,
{10:11} And the dust having cleaved to us from your city, we wipe off to you but know this, that the kingdom of God has drawn nigh to you.
{10:12} And I say to you, that it shall be more supportable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
{10:13} Woe to thee Chorazin! woe to thee Bethsaida! for if in Tyre and Sidon were the powers having been in you, long since had they changed the mind, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
{10:14} But for Tyre and Sidon shall it be more supportable in judgment, than for you.
{10:15} And thou, Capernaum, indeed even lifted up to heaven, shalt be cast down to hades.
{10:16} He hearing you hears me: and he rejecting you rejects me; and he rejecting me rejects him having sent me.
{10:17} And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, and the demons are subject to us in thy name.
{10:18} And he said to them, I saw Satan as lightning fallen from heaven.
{10:19} Behold, I give you power to tread above serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall hurt you.
{10:20} But in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, that your names were written in the heavens.
{10:21} In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I will acknowledge to thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and hast revealed them to babes: yes Father, for so was it benevolence before thee.
{10:22} All things were delivered me by my Father: and none knows who is the Son, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and to whomsoever the Son would wish to reveal.
{10:23} And having turned to the disciples apart he said, Happy the eyes seeing what ye see:
{10:24} For I say to you, that many prophets and kings wished to behold what ye see, and saw not; and to hear what ye hear, and heard not.
{10:25} And, behold, a certain skilled in the law stood up, tempting him, and saying, Teacher, what having done shall I inherit eternal life?
{10:26} And he said to him, What has been written in the law? how readest thou?
{10:27} And he having answered, said. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart, and from thy whole soul, and from thy whole strength; and thy neighbor as thyself.
{10:28} And he said to him, Thou hast answered rightly; this do and thou shalt live.
{10:29} And he, wishing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
{10:30} And Jesus having replied said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers: and having stripped him, and laid on blows, they departed, leaving him half dead.
{10:31} And by accident a certain priest went down in that way: and having seen him, went on the opposite side.
{10:32} And likewise also a Levite, having been in the place, having come and seen him, went on the opposite side.
{10:33} And a certain Samaritan, traveling, came to him: and having seen him, felt compassion.
{10:34} And having come near, he bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and having mounted him upon his own animal, he brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
{10:35} And upon the morrow, he having come forth, taking out two drachmas, he gave to the inn-keeper, and said to him, Take care of him; and whatever thou spendest besides, I, in my coming back, will repay thee.
{10:36} Which then of these three seems to thee to have been neighbor to him fallen among robbers?
{10:37} And he said, He having done mercy with him. Then said Jesus to him. Go thou, and do likewise.
{10:38} And it was in their going forth, and he came to a certain town: and a certain woman by the name of Martha received him in her house.
{10:39} And also a sister was to her, called Mary; and she having sat at Jesus' feet, heard his word.
{10:40} And Martha was perplexed about much service, and having stood before, said, Lord, carest thou not that my sister left me to serve alone? Speak therefore to her that she may lay hold and assist with me.
{10:41} And Jesus having answered, said to her, Martha, Martha, thou hast care, and art confused about many things:
{10:42} And of one thing there is need: and Mary has chosen the good part which shall not be taken away from her.
{11:1} And it was in his being in a certain place praying, when he ceased, a certain of his disciples said to him Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
{11:2} And he said to them, When ye pray, say, Our Father he in the heavens, Holy be thy name. Let thy kingdom come. Let thy will be, as in heaven, also upon the earth.
{11:3} Give us our bread sufficient for sustenance by the day.
{11:4} And remit to us our sins; for we ourselves also remit to everyone indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation; but deliver us from the evil.
{11:5} And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and should say to him. Friend, lend me three loaves;
{11:6} Since my friend has come to me from the way, and I have not what I may set before him?
{11:7} And he within, having answered, should say, offer not weariness to me: already has the door been shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot having risen, give thee.
{11:8} I say to you, If also having risen he will not give him because of being his friend, yet for his effrontery, having risen, he will give him as many as he needs.
{11:9} And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.
{11:10} For every one asking, receives; and he seeking, finds; and to him knocking, it shall be opened.
{11:11} And shall a son ask bread of any of you a father, will he give him a stone? And if a fish, for a fish he will not give him a serpent.
{11:12} Or also if he ask an egg, he will not give him a scorpion.
{11:13} If then ye, being evil, know to give good gifts to your children; how much more the Father, he from heaven, will give the Holy Spirit to them asking him?
{11:14} And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And it was the demon having come out, the dumb spake; and the crowds wondered.
{11:15} And certain of them said. By Beelzebul ruler of demons he casts out demons.
{11:16} And others, tempting, sought a sign of him from heaven.
{11:17} And he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is rendered desolate; and a house against a house falls.
{11:18} And if Satan also be divided against himself, how should his kingdom stand? for ye say by Beelzebul I cast out demons.
{11:19} And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast, out? for this shall they be your judges.
{11:20} And if by the finger of God I cast out demons, then has the kingdom of God got beforehand to you.
{11:21} When the strong, completely armed, should watch his court-yard, his possessions are in peace:
{11:22} And when a stronger than he, having come, conquers him, he takes away his complete armor in which he trusted, and distributes his spoils.
{11:23} He not being with me is against me: and he not gathering with me scatters.
{11:24} When the unclean spirit comes out from a man, he passes through places wanting water, seeking rest; and not finding, he says, I will return to my house whence I came out.
{11:25} And having come, he finds it swept and set in order.
{11:26} Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself; and having entered, they dwell there: and the last things of that man are worse than the first.
{11:27} And it was in his speaking these things, a certain woman of the crowd, having lifted up the voice, said to him, in the heavens, where the thief approaches not, nor moth corrupts. Happy the womb having borne thee, and breasts thou didst suck.
{11:28} And he said, Rather, happy they hearing the word of God, and watching it.
{11:29} And crowds being collected, he began to say, This is an evil generation: it seeks a sign; and no sign shall be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.
{11:30} For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall be the Son of man to this generation.
{11:31} The queen of the south shall be raised up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, more than Solomon here.
{11:32} The Ninevite men shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and condemn it: for they repented at the proclamation of Jonas; and, behold, more than Jonas here.
{11:33} And none, having lighted a lamp, puts in secret, neither under a bushel, but upon the chandelier, that they coming in should see the light.
{11:34} The light of the body is the eye; when therefore thine eye be plain, also thy whole body is clear: and when it be evil, also thy body dark.
{11:35} Take heed therefore lest the light in thee be darkness.
{11:36} If therefore thy whole body clear, not having any part dark, the whole shall be clear, as when a lamp enlightens thee with its gleam.
{11:37} And in the speaking, a certain Pharisee asked him that he would dine with him: and having come in he reclined.
{11:38} And the Pharisee having seen, wondered that he was not first washed before dinner.
{11:39} And the Lord said to him, Now ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and trencher; and your inside is full of plunder and wickedness.
{11:40} O foolish, has not he having made the outside, also made the inside?
{11:41} But of the things being, give alms; and, behold, all things are clean to you.
{11:42} But woe to you, Pharisees! for ye tithe spearmint and rue and every plant, and ye pass by the judgment and love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to have left those.
{11:43} Woe to you, Pharisees! for ye love the first seat in assemblies, and greetings in market-places.
{11:44} Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as concealed tombs, and men walking above know not.
{11:45} And a certain of the skilled in the law having answered, said, Teacher, speaking these things, and thou injurest us.
{11:46} And he said, And woe to you, skilled in the law! for ye load men with loads difficult to carry, and ye yourselves touch not one of the fingers to the load.
{11:47} Woe to you! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
{11:48} Surely ye testify and assent to your fathers works: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their tombs.
{11:49} And for this said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and the sent, and of them shall they kill and drive out:
{11:50} That the blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world be required of this generation;
{11:51} From the blood of Abel even to the blood of Zacharias perishing between the altar and house: yea, I say to you, It shall be required of this generation.
{11:52} Woe to you, skilled in the law! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye came not in yourselves, and those coming in ye hindered.
{11:53} And he saying these things to them, the scribes and Pharisees began to hold on greatly, and to put questions to him of many things:
{11:54} Laying wait for him, and seeking to seize something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.
{12:1} Upon which, myriads of the crowd having been gathered together, so as to tread upon one another, he began to speak to his disciples first, Keep yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
{12:2} And there is nothing covered, which shall not be revealed; and secret which shall not be known.
{12:3} Therefore whatever ye have said in darkness shall be heard in light; and what ye spake to the ear in storehouses shall be proclaimed upon house-tops.
{12:4} And I say to you, my friends, Be not afraid of those killing the body, and after these not having anything remaining to do.
{12:5} And I will shew you whom ye should fear: Fear him having power, after killing, to cast into hell; yea, I say to you, Fear him.
{12:6} Are not five little sparrows sold for two small coins, and one of them is not forgotten before God?
{12:7} But also the hairs of your head were all numbered. Therefore fear not: ye have the preeminence over many little sparrows.
{12:8} And I say to you, Every one who should acknowledge in me before men, also the Son of man will acknowledge in him before the messengers of God.
{12:9} And he having denied me before men, shall he denied before the messengers of God.
{12:10} And every one who shall say a word against the Son of man, it shall be remitted to him: and to him blaspheming against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be remitted.
{12:11} And when they bring you to assemblies, and beginnings, and powers, have no anxiety how or what ye allege for justification, or what ye say:
{12:12} For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour what ye must say.
{12:13} And a certain one out of the crowd said to him, Teacher, speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me.
{12:14} And he said to him, Man, who appointed me judge or distributer over you.
{12:15} And he said to them, See, and watch yourselves from covetousness: for not in the abounding to any one of his possessions is his life.
{12:16} And he spake a parable to them, saying, The farm of a certain rich man bore well:
{12:17} And he calculated in himself, saying, What shall I do, for I have not where I shall collect together my fruits?
{12:18} And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my stores, and build greater; and there will I collect all my produce and my good things.
{12:19} And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast many good things laid up for many years; rest, eat, drink, be gladdened.
{12:20} And God said to him, O foolish one, this night they require thy soul from thee: and what thou hast prepared, to whom shall it be?
{12:21} So he treasuring up for himself, and not rich toward God.
{12:22} And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Have no anxiety for your soul, what ye eat; nor for the body what ye put on.
{12:23} The soul is more than food, and the body than clothing.
{12:24} Consider the ravens: for they sow not neither do they reap; to them there is not store-house nor store; and God nourishes them: how much more have ye preeminence of the fowls?
{12:25} And which of you having anxiety can add to his size one cubit?
{12:26} If then ye cannot do the least, why have ye anxiety for the rest?
{12:27} Consider the white lilies, how they grow; they are not wearied, neither do they spin; and I say to you, neither was Solomon in all his glory clothed as one of these.
{12:28} And if the grass, to day being in the field and to morrow cast into the furnace, God so clothes; how much rather you, ye of little faith?
{12:29} And ye, seek ye not what ye eat, or what ye drink, and keep not in anxiety.
{12:30} For all these things the nations of the world seek for: and your Father knows that ye have need of these.
{12:31} But seek the kingdom of God; and all these shall be added to you.
{12:32} Fear not, little flock; for your Father was contented to give you the kingdom.
{12:33} Sell your possessions, and give alms; make to yourselves purses not growing old, an inexhaustible treasure in the heavens, where the thief approaches not, nor moth corrupts.
{12:34} For where your treasure is, there also will be your heart.
{12:35} Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;
{12:36} And ye like men expecting their Lord, when he shall loose from the nuptials; that having come and knocked, they might quickly open to him.
{12:37} Happy those servants, whom the Lord having come shall find watching; truly I say to you, he will gird himself, and make them recline, and having come he will serve them.
{12:38} And if he should come in the second watch, and should come in the third watch, and find so, happy are those servants.
{12:39} And know this, that if the master of the house knew what hour the thief is coming, he had watched, and not have suffered his house to be undermined.
{12:40} And be ye therefore ready: for in the time which ye think not the Son of man is coming.
{12:41} And Peter said to him, Lord, sayest thou this parable to us, or also to all?
{12:42} And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, which the Lord will set over his household, to give the allowance of wheat in due time?
{12:43} Happy that servant, which his Lord, having come, shall find so doing.
{12:44} Truly I say to you, that he will set him over all his possessions.
{12:45} And if that servant should say in his heart, My Lord delays to come; and should begin to strike the servants and maids, also to eat and drink, and to be intoxicated;
{12:46} The lord of that servant shall come in a day which he expects not, and in an hour which he knows not, and he will cut him in two equal parts, and set his portion with the unbelieving.
{12:47} And that servant having known his lord's will, and not prepared, neither having done his will, shall be skinned with many.
{12:48} And he not having known, and having done things worthy of blows, shall be skinned with few. And to every one to whom much was given, shall much be required of him: and with whom they have deposited much, they will ask of him the more.
{12:49} I have come to cast fire into the earth; and what will I if it has been already lighted up!
{12:50} And I have an immersion to be immersed with; and how am I pressed together till it should be finished!
{12:51} Think ye that I came to give peace in the earth? Nay, I say to you; but rather division:
{12:52} For from now shall five be in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
{12:53} Father shall be divided against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
{12:54} And he said to the crowds, When ye see a cloud rising from the descents, ye say quickly, A heavy shower of rain is coming; and it is so.
{12:55} And when the south wind blowing, ye say, That there will be heat; and it is.
{12:56} O hypocrites, ye know to judge the face of the earth and of heaven; and how do ye not judge this time?
{12:57} And why also of yourselves judge ye not the just thing?
{12:58} For when thou retirest with thine adversary to the ruler, in the way give labor to be released from him; lest he drag thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the avenger, and the avenger cast thee into prison.
{12:59} I say to thee, thou shouldest not come out thence, even till also thou shouldest give back the last small coin.
{13:1} And certain were present in that time announcing to him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate mingled with their sacrifices.
{13:2} And Jesus having answered, said to them, Think ye that these Galileans were sinful above all the Galileans, because they have suffered such things?
{13:3} No, I say to you: but except ye should change the mind, ye shall all likewise perish.
{13:4} Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think ye that these were debtors above all men dwelling in Jerusalem?
{13:5} No, I say: but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
{13:6} And he spake this parable: A certain had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit on it, and found not.
{13:7} And he said to the vine-dresser, Behold, three years I am come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find not: cut it off; wherefore also does it leave the earth unemployed?
{13:8} And he having answered says to him, Lord, let it go also this year, till I shall dig round it, and cast dung:
{13:9} Whereas also it might bear fruit: and if not, afterwards thou shalt cut it off.
{13:10} And he was teaching in one of the assemblies in the sabbaths.
{13:11} And, behold, there was a woman having a spirit of weakness eighteen years, and was bent together, and not able wholly to lift up the head.
{13:12} And having seen her, Jesus called to, and said to her, Woman, thou hast been loosed from thy weakness.
{13:13} And he put his hands on her: and immediately she was set upright, and honoured God.
{13:14} And the ruler of the assembly having answered, feeling pain because Jesus cured on the sabbath, said to the crowd, Six days there are in which they ought to work; in those therefore, coming, be ye cured, and not the day of the sabbath.
{13:15} Then answered the Lord and said, Hypocrite, does not each of you on the sabbath loose his ox or ass from the stall, and leading away, give to drink?
{13:16} And this being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, behold, eighteen years, ought she not to be loosed from this bond the day of the sabbath
{13:17} And he saying these things, all opposed to him were ashamed: and the crowd rejoiced for all the glorious things done by him.
{13:18} And he said, To what is the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I liken it?
{13:19} It is like a kernel of mustard, which a man having taken, cast into his garden; and it grew, and became into a great tree; and the fowls of heaven encamped in its young shoots.
{13:20} And again he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?
{13:21} It is like leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three measures of wheaten flour, until the whole was leavened.
{13:22} And he went through cities and towns, teaching, and making his passage to Jerusalem.
{13:23} And a certain said to him, Lord, if few saved? And he said to them,
{13:24} Strive earnestly to enter through the narrow gate: for many, I say to you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
{13:25} From the time when the master of the house should rise up, and shut the door, and ye begin to stand without, and knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us: and having answered, he will say to you, I know not whence ye are:
{13:26} Then will ye begin to say, We ate and drank before thee, and thou didst teach in our streets.
{13:27} And he will say, I say to you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workmen of iniquity.
{13:28} Weeping shall be there and gnashing of teeth, when ye see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you cast without.
{13:29} And they shall come from the risings, and the settings, and from north, and south, and they shall recline in the kingdom of God.
{13:30} And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.
{13:31} In the same day certain Pharisees came near, saying to him, Come out, and go from thence: for Herod wishes to kill thee.
{13:32} And he said to them, Having gone, say to that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and complete cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I am completed.
{13:33} But I must go to day and to morrow and the following: for it is not possible for a prophet to perish out of Jerusalem.
{13:34} Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets, and striking with stones those having been sent to her; how often I wished to gather thy children together, which manner a hen her young brood under the wings, and ye would not!
{13:35} Behold, your house is left to you a desert: and truly I say to you, That ye should not see me, until it should come when ye say, Praised he coming in the name of the Lord.
{14:1} And it was in his coining into the house of a certain of the Pharisees in the sabbath to eat bread, and they were observing him narrowly.
{14:2} And, behold, a certain dropsical man was before him.
{14:3} And Jesus having answered, said to those skilled in the law and the Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to cure in the sabbath?
{14:4} And they were silent. And having taken, he healed, and loosed him.
{14:5} And having answered, he said to them, Whose ass or ox of yours shall fall into a well, and will he not quickly pull it out on the sabbath day?
{14:6} And they were not able to answer him in turn to these things.
{14:7} And he spake a parable to the called, fixing his attention how they chose out the first places at table; saying to them,
{14:8} When thou art called to the nuptials, thou shouldest not recline in the first place at table; lest a more honourable than thou be called by him:
{14:9} And he having called thee and him, having come, shall say to thee, Give place to this; and then thou shalt begin with shame to take possession of the last place.
{14:10} But when thou art called, having gone, recline in the last place; that when he having called thee come, might say to thee, Friend, mount up higher; then shall honour be to thee before them reclining with thee.
{14:11} For whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and he humbling himself shall be exalted.
{14:12} And he also said to him having called him, When thou makest a breakfast or supper, call not thy friends, nor thy rich neighbors, nor thy brethren; lest they call thee in return, and a giving back be to thee.
{14:13} But when thou makest an entertainment, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:
{14:14} And happy shalt thou be; for they have not to give back to thee: for it shall be given back to thee at the rising up of the just.
{14:15} And a certain of them having reclined together, having heard these things, said to him, Happy he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
{14:16} And he said to him, A certain man made a great supper and called many;
{14:17} And he sent his servant at the hour of the supper to say to the called, Come; for all things are already prepared.
{14:18} And from one they all began to conciliate. The first said to him, I bought a field, and have necessity to go and see it: I ask thee, have me pardoned.
{14:19} And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I ask thee, have me pardoned.
{14:20} And another said, I have married wife, and therefore I cannot come.
{14:21} And approaching, that servant announced to his lord these things. Then the master of the house, angry, said to his servant, Go forth quickly into the streets and quarters of the city, and bring in hither the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind.
{14:22} And the servant said, Lord, it has been done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is place.
{14:23} And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the ways and hedges, and compel to come in, that my house may be filled up.
{14:24} For I say to you, That none of those men called shall taste of my supper.
{14:25} And great crowds went with him, and having turned he said to them.
{14:26} If any come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, and yet also his own life, he cannot be my disciple.
{14:27} And whoever lifts not his cross, and comes after me, cannot be my disciple.
{14:28} For which of you, wishing to build a tower, not first, having sat down, calculates the expense, if he have things for completion?
{14:29} That lest, having set the foundation, and not able to finish, all seeing begin to mock him,
{14:30} Saying, That this man began to build, and was not able to finish.
{14:31} Or what king, going to fight with another king in war, not, having sat down first, consults, if he be able with ten thousand to meet him coming with twenty thousand against him?
{14:32} And if he, yet being far off, having sent an embassy, asks things for peace.
{14:33} So then, every one of you, who renounces not all of his possessions, cannot be my disciple.
{14:34} Salt good: but if salt be rendered insipid, with what shall it be fitted?
{14:35} Neither for the land, nor is it fitted for the dunghill; they cast it without. He having ears to hear, let him hear.
{15:1} And all publicans and sinful were drawing near him to hear him.
{15:2} And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, That this receives the sinful, and eats together with them.
{15:3} And he spake this parable to them, saying,
{15:4} What man of you, having one hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, leaves not the ninety-nine in the desert, and goes for the one lost, till he find it.
{15:5} And having found, he puts upon his shoulders, rejoicing.
{15:6} And having come into the house, he calls together friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me: for I have found my lost sheep.
{15:7} I say to you, that so shall joy be in heaven over one sinful repenting, more than over ninety-nine just, which have no need of repentance.
{15:8} Or what woman having ten drachmas, if she lose one drachma, lights not a lamp, and sweeps the house, and seeks diligently till she should find?
{15:9} And having found, she calls together female friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me; for I found the drachma which I lost.
{15:10} So, I say to you, joy is in heaven before the messengers of God for one sinful changing the mind.
{15:11} And he said, A certain man had two sons:
{15:12} And the younger of them said to the father, Father, give me the portion of property falling. And he divided to them the property.
{15:13} And not many days after, having gathered all things, the younger son went abroad into a far off country, and there disposed his property, living in a profligate manner.
{15:14} And having spent all things, a powerful famine was in that country; and he began to be in want.
{15:15} And having gone, he was joined to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into the fields to feed swine.
{15:16} And he eagerly desired to fill his belly with the fruits of the horntree which the swine ate: and none gave to him.
{15:17} And having come to himself, he said, Many hired of my father abound in loaves, and I am perishing with hunger!
{15:18} Having risen, I will go to my father, and say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,
{15:19} And I am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired.
{15:20} And having risen, he came to his father. And yet being far off, his father saw him, and felt compassion, and having run, fell upon his neck, and kissed him.
{15:21} And the son said to him, Father, I sinned against heaven, and before thee, and I am no more worthy to be called thy son.
{15:22} And the father said to his servants, Bring out the first robe, and clothe him; and give a ring for his hand, and shoes for the feet:
{15:23} And having brought the fatted calf, sacrifice, and eating, let us be gladdened.
{15:24} For this my son was dead, and has returned to life; and he was lost, and found. And they began to be gladdened.
{15:25} And his elder son was in the field: and coming, as he drew near the house, he heard a concert of music, and dances.
{15:26} And having called one of his servants, he inquired what these may be.
{15:27} And he said to him, That thy brother has come, and thy father has sacrificed the fatted calf; because he received him in good health.
{15:28} And he was angry and would not go in; then his father having come out, besought him.
{15:29} And he having answered said to the father, Behold, so many years I serve thee, and never at any time passed by thy command: and never hast thou given me a kid, that I might be gladdened with my friends.
{15:30} And when this thy son, devouring thy property with harlots, came, thou hast sacrificed for him the fattened calf.
{15:31} And he said to him, Child, thou art always with me, and all mine are thine.
{15:32} And to be gladdened, and to rejoice, was fitting: for this thy brother was dead, and has returned to life; and he was lost, and found.
{16:1} And he said to his disciples, A certain man was rich, who had a steward; and he was slandered to him as dispersing his goods.
{16:2} And having called him, he said to him, What is this I hear of thee give back the word of thy stewardship; for thou canst no more be steward.
{16:3} And the steward said in himself, What shall I do? for my lord takes away the stewardship from me: I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.
{16:4} I have resolved what I will do, that, when I should be removed from the stewardship, they might receive me in their houses.
{16:5} And having called upon each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord.
{16:6} And he said, An hundred baths of oil. And he said to him, Take thou thy book, and having quickly sat down, write fifty.
{16:7} Then said he to another, How much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him, Take thy book, and write eighty.
{16:8} And the Lord praised the steward of injustice, because he did wisely: for the sons of this life are wiser than the children of light in their generation.
{16:9} And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of injustice; that, when ye fail, they might receive you into lasting tents.
{16:10} He faithful in the least, is also faithful in much: and he unjust in the least, is also unjust in much.
{16:11} If therefore ye were not faithful in the unjust mammon, who shall trust to you the true?
{16:12} And if ye were not faithful with another, who shall give you your own?
{16:13} No servant can serve two lords: for he will either hate one, and love the other; or he will hold firmly to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
{16:14} And the Pharisees heard all these things, being avaricious: and they derided him.
{16:15} And he said to them, Ye are they justifying yourselves before men; and God knows your hearts: for the high with men is abomination before God.
{16:16} The law and the prophets until John: from then the kingdom of God announces good news, and every one is forced into it.
{16:17} And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one horn of the law to fall.
{16:18} Every one loosing his wife, and marrying another, commits adultery: and every one marrying her having been loosed from the husband commits adultery.
{16:19} A certain man was rich, and was clothed in purple and fine linen, being daily splendidly gladdened:
{16:20} And there was a certain beggar, Lazarus by name, who was cast at his gate, having been wounded,
{16:21} And eagerly desirous to be fed from crumbs falling from the rich one's table: but also the dogs, coming, licked off his wounds.
{16:22} And it was, the beggar died, and was carried by messengers into Abraham's bosom: and the rich one died also, and was buried;
{16:23} And in hades, having lifted up his eyes, being in torments, he sees Abraham from far off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
{16:24} And he having called out, said, Father Abraham, pity me, and send Lazarus, that he might dip his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
{16:25} But Abraham said, Child, remember that thou didst receive thy good things in thy life, and Lazarus likewise evil things: and now here is he comforted, and thou art tormented.
{16:26} And besides all these, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed: so that they wishing to pass through thence to you could not; neither could they cross over from thence to us.
{16:27} And he said, Then I ask thee, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:
{16:28} For I have five brethren; that he might testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
{16:29} Abraham says to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
{16:30} And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if some one from the dead go to them, they will change the mind.
{16:31} And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither if any rise from the dead, will they be persueded.
{17:1} And he said to the disciples, It is impossible there come not causes of offence: and woe, through whom they come!
{17:2} It is profitable to him if the millstone of an ass were placed about his neck, and he cast into the sea, rather than he should offend one of these little ones.
{17:3} Attend to yourselves: and if thy brother sin against thee, censure him; and if he should repent, let him go.
{17:4} And if seven times in a day he sin against thee, and seven times in a day turn back to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt let him go.
{17:5} And the sent said to the Lord, Add faith to us.
{17:6} And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a kernel of mustard, said ye to this mulberry-tree, Be thou rooted up, and planted in the sea; and it had listened to you.
{17:7} And which of you having a servant ploughing or feeding, who will say to him having come out of the field, Quickly having come, recline?
{17:8} But will he not say to him, Prepare what I shall sup, and, being girded, serve me, till I eat and drink; and after these, thou mayest eat and drink?
{17:9} He has no favor to that servant, for he did the things appointed. I think not.
{17:10} So also ye, when ye do all appointed you, say, That we are useless servants: for what we ought to do, we have done.
{17:11} And it was in his going to Jerusalem, and he came through the land of Samaria and Galilee.
{17:12} And he coming to a certain town, ten leprous men met him, who stood far off:
{17:13} And they lifted up the voice, saying, Jesus, faster, pity us.
{17:14} And having seen, he said to them, Having gone, show yourselves to the priests. And it was in their retiring they were cleansed.
{17:15} And one of them, having seen that he was healed, turned back, with a great voice honouring God.
{17:16} And he fell upon the face at his feet, thanking him: and he was a Samaritan.
{17:17} And Jesus having answered said, Were not ten cleansed? and where the nine?
{17:18} They were not found returning to give glory to God, except this of another race.
{17:19} And he said to him, Having risen, go: thy faith has saved thee.
{17:20} And having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God comes, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God comes not with observation:
{17:21} Neither shall they say, Behold here or, behold there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
{17:22} And he said to the disciples, The days come when ye shall eagerly desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see.
{17:23} And they shall say to you, Behold here, or; behold there: go not away, nor pursue.
{17:24} For as lightning, flashing out from that under heaven, shines to that under heaven; so also shall be the Son of man in his day.
{17:25} And first must he suffer many things, and be disapproved of by this generation.
{17:26} And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be in the days of the Son of man.
{17:27} They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, till the day which Noe came into the ark, and the overflow came, and destroyed all.
{17:28} And likewise as it was in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
{17:29} And the day which Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from heaven, and destroyed all.
{17:30} According to these shall be the day in which the Son of man is revealed.
{17:31} In that day, whoever shall be upon the house, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he in the fields, likewise let him not turn back behind.
{17:32} Remember Lot's wife.
{17:33} Whoever should seek to save his life shall lose it; and whoever shall lose it, shall preserve it alive.
{17:34} I say to you, that night shall be two upon one bed; one shall be taken, and the other let go.
{17:35} Two females shall be grinding together; one shall be taken, and the other let go.
{17:36} [Verse 36 is wanting (Missing) in most of the Greek copies.]
{17:37} And having answered, they say to him, Where, Lord And he said to them, Where the body, there shall the eagles be gathered together.
{18:1} And he spake to them a parable, that they must always pray, and not lose courage;
{18:2} Saying, There was a certain judge in a certain city, fearing not God, and not occupied about man:
{18:3} And a widow was in that city; and she came to him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
{18:4} And he would not for a time: and after these he said in himself, And if I fear not God, and am not occupied about man;
{18:5} Yet because this widow produces fatigue to me, I will avenge her, lest in the end, coming, she give me a blow under the eyes.
{18:6} And the Lord said, Hear ye what the judge of injustice says.
{18:7} And shall not God do the avenging of his chosen, crying to him day and night, being slow to anger toward them?
{18:8} I say to you, that he will do their avenging swiftly. But the Son of man having come, shall he find faith upon earth
{18:9} And he spake to certain trusting upon themselves that they were just, and setting at nought the rest, this parable:
{18:10} Two men went up to the temple to pray; one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
{18:11} The Pharisee having stood, prayed these to himself, O God, I return thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unjust, adulterers, or also as this publican.
{18:12} I fast twice of the Sabbath; I pay tithes of all I possess.
{18:13} And the publican, standing afar off, would not either lift up the eyes to heaven, but struck upon his breast, saying, God propitiate for me the sinful.
{18:14} I say to you, this one went down to his house justified rather than that one: for every one lifting up himself shall be humbled; and he humbling himself shall be lifted up.
{18:15} And they also brought babes to him, that he might touch them: and the disciples having seen, censured them.
{18:16} And Jesus having called them, said, Leave the young children to come to me, and hinder them not: for of such is time kingdom of God.
{18:17} Truly I say to you, Whoever should not receive the kingdom of God as a young child should not enter into it.
{18:18} And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, having done what, shall I inherit eternal life?
{18:19} And Jesus said to him, Why sayest thou me good? none good except the one God.
{18:20} Thou knowest the commands, Thou shouldest not commit adultery, Thou shouldest not kill, Thou shouldest not steal, Thou shouldest not bear false testimony, Honour thy father and thy mother.
{18:21} And he said, All these have I watched from my youth.
{18:22} And Jesus having heard these, said to him, Yet one thing fails thee: all whatever thou hast, sell and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
{18:23} And he having heard these things, was sorely grieved: for he was very rich.
{18:24} And Jesus having seen him being sorely grieved, said, With how much difficulty shall they having possessions come into the kingdom of God!
{18:25} For it is easier for a camel to come through the hole of a needle, than for a rich one to come into the kingdom of God.
{18:26} And they having heard, said, And who can be saved?
{18:27} And he said, The things impossible with men, are possible with God.
{18:28} And Peter said, Behold, we have left all, and followed thee.
{18:29} And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That there is none who has left home, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for sake of the kingdom of God,
{18:30} Who should not receive many fold in this time, and in life coming, eternal life.
{18:31} And taking the twelve, he said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things written by the prophets shall be completed to the Son of man.
{18:32} For he shall be delivered to the nations, and be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon:
{18:33} And having scourged, they shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise.
{18:34} And they understood nothing of these things: and this word was hidden from them, and they discerned not the things spoken.
{18:35} And it was in his drawing near to Jericho, a certain blind sat by the way, begging:
{18:36} And having heard the multitude passing by, he inquired what this might be.
{18:37} And they announced to him, That Jesus the Nazarite passes by.
{18:38} And he cried out, saying, Jesus, son of David, pity me.
{18:39} And they going before censured him, that he be silent: and he so much the more cried out, O son of David, pity me.
{18:40} And Jesus having stood, commanded him to be brought to him: and he having drawn near, he asked him,
{18:41} Saying, What wilt thou I shall do to thee? And he said, Lord, that I:night see again.
{18:42} And Jesus said to him, See again: thy faith has saved thee.
{18:43} And he immediately saw again, and followed him, honouring God: and all the people having seen, gave praise to God.
{19:1} And having come in, he passed through Jericho.
{19:2} And, behold, a man, called Zaccheus by name, and he was chief of the publicans, and he was rich.
{19:3} And he sought to see Jesus, who he is; and he could not, from the crowd, for he was small in size.
{19:4} And having run before, he went up upon an Egyptian fig tree, that he might see him: for he was about to pass through that.
{19:5} And when he came to the place, having looked up, Jesus saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, having hastened, come down; for to day must I remain in thine house.
{19:6} And having hasted, he came down, and received him rejoicing.
{19:7} And all they having seen, murmured, saying, That he entered in to rest with a sinful man.
{19:8} And Zaccheus having stood, said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor; and if I have made any false accusation against any one, I give back fourfold.
{19:9} And Jesus said to him, That to day salvation has been to this house, as he is also a son of Abraham.
{19:10} For the Son of man came to seek and to save the lost.
{19:11} And they hearing these things, having added, he spake a parable, for he was near to Jerusalem, and they thought that immediately the kingdom of God is about to be rendered visible.
{19:12} Then he said, A certain honourable man went into a country far off to take unto himself a kingdom, and to return.
{19:13} And having called his ten servants, he gave them ten coins, and said to them, Attend to business, till I come.
{19:14} And his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We wish not this to reign over us.
{19:15} And it was in his coming back, having received the kingdom, and he spake to have these servants called to him, to whom he gave the silver, that he might know who had attended to any business.
{19:16} And the first approached, saying, Lord, thy coin has gained ten coins.
{19:17} And he said to him, Well, good servant: because thou west faithful in the least, be thou having power over ten cities.
{19:18} And the second came saying, Lord, thy coin made five coins.
{19:19} And he said to him, And be thou over five cities.
{19:20} And another came saying, Lord, behold, thy coin which I have placed in a napkin:
{19:21} For I feared thee, for thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou layedst not down, and thou reapest what thou didst not sow.
{19:22} And he said to him, Out of thy month will I judge thee, O evil servant. Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I sowed not:
{19:23} And wherefore gavest thou not my silver to the bankers, and I having come had received it with interest?
{19:24} And to those standing by he said, Take away from him the coin, and give to him having the ten coins.
{19:25} (And they said to him, Lord, he has ten coins.)
{19:26} For I say to you, That to every one having shall be given; and from him not having, and what he has shall be taken away from him.
{19:27} But those mine enemies, not having wished me to reign over them, bring hither, and slaughter before me.
{19:28} And having said these, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.
{19:29} And it was as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount called of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
{19:30} Having said, Retire ye to the opposite town; in which entering, ye shall find a colt bound, upon which none of men at any time have sat: having loosed, bring him.
{19:31} And if any ask you, Wherefore loose ye? thus shall ye say to him, Because the Lord has need of him.
{19:32} And the sent, having departed, found as he said to them.
{19:33} And they loosing the colt, his lords said to them, Why loose ye the colt?
{19:34} And they said, The Lord has need of him.
{19:35} And they brought him to Jesus: and having cast their garments upon the colt, they placed Jesus upon.
{19:36} And he going, they laid down their garments in the way.
{19:37} And he already drawing near to the descent of the mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples, rejoicing, began to praise God with a great voice for all the powers which they saw;
{19:38} Saying, Praised the king coming in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest ones.
{19:39} And certain of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, Teacher, censure thy disciples.
{19:40} And having answered, he said to them, I say to you, that if these should be silent, the stones shall cry out.
{19:41} And as he drew near, having seen the city, he wept over it,
{19:42} Saying, That if thou knewest, also thou, and also in this thy day, the things for thy peace! and now have they been hid from thine eyes.
{19:43} For the days shall come upon thee, and thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and keep thee together from all sides,
{19:44} And they shall level thee with the ground, and thy children in thee; they shall not leave in thee stone upon stone; because thou knewest not the time of thine inspection.
{19:45} And having come into the temple, he began to cast out them selling and buying in it;
{19:46} Saying to them, It has been written, My house is the house of prayer: and ye have made it a den of robbers.
{19:47} And he was teaching in the day in the temple. And the chief priests and scribes and the first of the people sought to destroy him,
{19:48} And they found not what they might do: for all the people hearing hanged on him.
{20:1} And it was in one of those days, he teaching the people in the temple, and announcing good news, there came forth the chief priests, and the scribes, and the more ancient,
{20:2} And they spake to him, saying, Say to us, by what authority doest thou these? or who is he having given thee this authority?
{20:3} And having answered he said to them, I will ask you one word; and tell me:
{20:4} Was the immersion of John of heaven, or of men.
{20:5} And they reckoned up together to themselves, saying, That if we say, of heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
{20:6} And if we say, of men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded John to be a prophet.
{20:7} And they answered not to know from whence.
{20:8} And Jesus said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these.
{20:9} And he began to say to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it to farmers, and went abroad sufficient time.
{20:10} And in time he sent a servant to the farmers, that they give him from the fruit of the vineyard: and the farmers, skinning, sent him out empty.
{20:11} And he added to send another servant: and they also having skinned and dishonoured him, sent forth empty.
{20:12} And he added to send a third; and also, having wounded, they cast him out.
{20:13} And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do I will send my dearly beloved son: perhaps, having seen him, they will change.
{20:14} And the farmers having seen him, reasoned to themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance be ours.
{20:15} And having cast him without the vineyard, they killed. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?
{20:16} He shall come and destroy these farmers, and give the vineyard to others. And having heard, they said, It may not be.
{20:17} And having looked upon them, he said, What then is this written, The stone which the builders disapproved of, this has been for the head of the corner?
{20:18} Every one having fallen upon that stone shall be crushed, and upon whomsoever it should fall, it shall winnow him.
{20:19} And the chief priests and scribes sought to lay hands upon him in the same hour; and they feared the people: for they knew he spake this parable against them.
{20:20} And having observed narrowly, they sent liers-in-wait, feigning themselves to be just, that they might seize upon his word, to deliver him to the beginning and authority of the leader.
{20:21} And they asked him, saying. Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and thou receivest not the face, but teachest in truth the way of God:
{20:22} Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not.
{20:23} And having perceived their craft, he said to them, Why tempt ye me?
{20:24} Show me drachma. Whose image and inscription has it? And having answered they said, Caesar's.
{20:25} And he said to them, Return therefore to Caesar, Caesar's things, and to God the things of God.
{20:26} And they were not able to seize upon his word before the people: and having wondered at his answer, they were silent.
{20:27} And certain of the Sadducees having approached, speaking against there being a rising up, asked him,
{20:28} Saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If any one's brother die having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
{20:29} Therefore were there seven brethren: and the first having taken a wife, died without children.
{20:30} And the second took the wife, and he died without children.
{20:31} And the third took her; and likewise also the seven: and they left no children, and died.
{20:32} And after all died the woman also.
{20:33} Then in the rising up, whose wife of them is she for seven had her a wife.
{20:34} And Jesus having answered, said to them, The sons of this life marry, and are given in marriage.
{20:35} And they having been deemed worthy to obtain that life, and the rising up of the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
{20:36} For neither can they die any more: for they are like to messengers; and are sons of God, being the sons of the rising up.
{20:37} And that the dead are raised, Moses made known at the bramble, when he calls the Lord, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.
{20:38} And he is not God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.
{20:39} And certain of the scribes having answered, said, Teacher, thou speakest well.
{20:40} And they dared no more to ask him anything.
{20:41} And he said to them, how say they Christ to be son of David?
{20:42} And David himself says in the book of Psalms, the Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou from my right hand,
{20:43} Even till I set thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.
{20:44} David therefore calls him Lord, and how is be his son?
{20:45} And all the people hearing, he said to his disciples,
{20:46} Hold from the scribes, wishing to walk about in robes, and loving greetings in the markets, and precedencies in assemblies, and the first places at tables at suppers;
{20:47} Who devour widows' houses, and for a pretence pray at great length; these shall receive more abundant judgment.
{21:1} And having looked up, he saw the rich casting their gifts into the royal treasury.
{21:2} And he also saw a certain poor widow casting there two small coins.
{21:3} And he said, Truly I say to you, that this poor widow has cast in more than all:
{21:4} For all they, of that abounding to them, have cast in to the gifts of God: and she from her want cast in all the living which she had.
{21:5} And certain speaking of the temple, that it has been arranged with beautiful stones and decorations, he said,
{21:6} These which ye see, the days shall come, in which stone shall not be left upon stone, which shall not be loosened.
{21:7} And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when therefore shall these be and what the sign when these should be about to be.
{21:8} And he said, See ye, be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, That I am; and the time has drawn near: therefore go not after them.
{21:9} And when ye hear of wars and tumults, be not terrified: for these must first be; but the end not immediately.
{21:10} Then said he to them, Nation shall be raised up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
{21:11} And great earthquakes in places, and famines, and scourges shall be; and terrific objects and great signs shall be from heaven.
{21:12} And before all these shall they cast their hands upon you, and drive out, delivering to assemblies, and prisons, being brought before kings and leaders for my name's sake.
{21:13} And it shall turn out to you for a testimony.
{21:14} Set therefore in your hearts, not to practise beforehand to justify yourselves:
{21:15} For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all they opposed to you shall not be able to contradict nor withstand.
{21:16} And ye shall also be delivered up by parents, and brethren, and kinsmen, and friends; and they shall put of you to death.
{21:17} And ye shall be hated by all for my name's sake.
{21:18} And there shall not a hair of your head perish.
{21:19} In your patience possess ye your souls.
{21:20} And when ye see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its devastation has drawn near.
{21:21} Then let those in Judea flee to the mountain; and those in the midst of her withdraw; and let those in the countries not go into her.
{21:22} For these are the days of vengeance, that all things having been written, should be completed.
{21:23} And woe to them having in the womb, and to them giving suck, in those days! for there shall be great necessity upon the land, and anger upon this people.
{21:24} And they shall fall by the mouth of the sword, and they shall be made captives in all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by all the nations, till the times of the nations should be completed.
{21:25} And signs shall be in the sun, and moon, and stars; and upon earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and commotion resounding.
{21:26} Men losing breath for fear and expectation of things coming on the habitable globe: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
{21:27} And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with much power and glory.
{21:28} And these things beginning to be, get out of danger, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draws near.
{21:29} And he spake to them a parable; See the fig tree, and all trees;
{21:30} When they should already throw forth, seeing of yourselves ye know that summer is already near.
{21:31} So also ye, when ye see these being, know that the kingdom of God is near.
{21:32} Truly I say to you, That this generation should not pass away, even till all things should be.
{21:33} Heaven and earth shall pass away: and my words shall not pass away.
{21:34} And attend to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be loaded with dizziness, caused by excess, and drunkenness, and cares of life, and that day come upon you unexpectedly.
{21:35} For as a snare shall it come upon all remaining upon the face of all, the earth.
{21:36} Watch therefore, in all time praying, that ye be deemed worthy to escape all these about to be, and to stand before the Son of man.
{21:37} And the days he was teaching in the temple; and the nights, coming out, he lodged in the mount called of Olives.
{21:38} And all the people arose early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.
{22:1} And the festival of unleavened drew near, called the Pascha.
{22:2} And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
{22:3} And Satan came into Judas called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
{22:4} And having departed, he conversed with the chief priests and the generals, how he might deliver him to them.
{22:5} And they rejoiced, and agreed to give him silver.
{22:6} And he promised, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them apart from the crowd.
{22:7} And the day of unleavened came, in which must be sacrificed the pascha.
{22:8} And he sent Peter and John, saying, Having gone, prepare ye for us the pascha, that we might eat.
{22:9} And they said to him, Where wilt thou that we should prepare?
{22:10} And he said to them, Behold, you having come to the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing an earthen vessel of water; follow ye him to the house where he goes in.
{22:11} And ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to thee, Where is the room where I should eat the pascha with my disciples?
{22:12} And he shall shew you a great upper room spread: there prepare ye.
{22:13} And having departed, they found as he said to them; and they prepared the pascha.
{22:14} And when it was the hour, he reclined, and the twelve sent with him.
{22:15} And he said to them, With eager desire have I desired to eat this pascha with you before I suffer:
{22:16} For I say to you, no more should I eat of it, till when it should be completed in the kingdom of God.
{22:17} Having taken the cup, and returned thanks, he said, Take this, and divide among yourselves:
{22:18} For I say to you, that I drink not of the fruit of the vine, till when the kingdom of God comes.
{22:19} Having taken the bread, and returned thanks, he brake, and gave them, saying, This is my body given for you: this do ye for my remembrance.
{22:20} Likewise also the cup after supping, saying, This the cup, the new covenant in my blood, poured out for you:
{22:21} But, behold, the hand of him delivering me up with me at the table.
{22:22} And truly the Son of man goes according to that determined: but woe to that man by whom he is delivered up!
{22:23} And they began to seek together among themselves, which of them it should be that was about to do this thing.
{22:24} And a love of strife was in them, which of them thinks to be the greater.
{22:25} And he said to them, The kings of the nations rule over them; and they exercising power over them are called benefactors.
{22:26} And ye not so: but let the greater with you be as the younger; and he leading, as he serving.
{22:27} For which the greater, he reclining, or he serving? is not he reclining and I am in the midst of you as he serving.
{22:28} And ye are they having remained with me in my temptations.
{22:29} And I set to you, as my Father set to me, a kingdom;
{22:30} That ye might eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and might sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
{22:31} And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded you, to sift as wheat:
{22:32} And I have supplicated for thee that thy faith fail not: and thou, when having turned back, confirm thy brethren.
{22:33} And he said to him, Lord, with thee am I ready to go, and to prison, and to death.
{22:34} And he said, I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not utter a sound this day, before thou shalt thrice deny knowing me.
{22:35} And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did ye want any thing? And they said, Nothing,
{22:36} Then said he to them, But now, he having a purse, let him take up, and likewise a wallet: and he not having, let him sell his garment, and buy a sword.
{22:37} For I say to you, that this written must yet be finished in me, that, Also was he reckoned with the lawless: for also the things concerning me have an end.
{22:38} And they said, Lord, behold, two swords here. And he said to them, It is enough.
{22:39} And having come out, he went, according to custom, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples followed him.
{22:40} And being at the place, he said to them, Pray ye not to enter into temptation.
{22:41} And he was removed from them about a stone's cast, and having placed the knees, he prayed,
{22:42} Saying, Father, If thou art willing, turn aside this cup from me: but not my will, but thine, be done.
{22:43} And a messenger was seen to him from heaven, strengthening him.
{22:44} And being in a violent struggle, he prayed more intently: and his sweat was as clots of blood coming down upon the earth.
{22:45} And having risen from prayer, having come to his disciples, he found them sleeping from grief;
{22:46} And he said to them, Why sleep ye? having risen, pray that ye might not enter into temptation.
{22:47} And he yet speaking, Behold a crowd, and he called Judas, one of the twelve, came before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.
{22:48} And Jesus said to him, Judas, deliverest thou up the Son of man with a kiss?
{22:49} And they about him, having seen that, going to be, said to him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword.
{22:50} And a certain one of them struck a servant of the chief priest, and took away his right ear.
{22:51} And Jesus having answered said, Allow ye even to this. And having touched his ear, he healed him.
{22:52} And Jesus said to the chief priests, and generals of the temple, and the elders, having come to him, Have ye come out, as upon a robber, with sword and sticks?
{22:53} I being with you daily in the temple, ye stretched not forth the hands upon me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
{22:54} And having taken, they brought him into the house of the chief priest. And Peter followed him far off.
{22:55} And having kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and they having sat down together, Peter sat down in the midst of them.
{22:56} And a certain young girl having seen him sitting by the light, and looked intently upon him, said, And this was with him.
{22:57} And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
{22:58} And after a little another having seen him, said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
{22:59} And about the space of one hour a certain other assured himself, saying, of a truth this also was with him: for he is a Galilean.
{22:60} And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, he yet speaking, the cock uttered a sound.
{22:61} And the Lord having turned, looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, That before the cock utters a sound, thou shalt deny me thrice.
{22:62} And Peter having come forth without wept bitterly.
{22:63} And the men holding Jesus mocked him, stripping.
{22:64} And having covered him, they struck his face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy who it is having struck thee.
{22:65} And many other things, blaspheming, they spake against him.
{22:66} And when it was day, the council of elders of the people was gathered together, and the chief priests and scribes, and they brought him to their council,
{22:67} Saying, Art thou Christ? tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye would not believe:
{22:68} And if I ask you, ye would not answer me, or loose me.
{22:69} From now shall the Son of man be sitting from the right hand of the power of God.
{22:70} And they all said, Art thou therefore the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say that I am.
{22:71} And they said, Why have we yet need of testimony? for we ourselves have heard from his month.
{23:1} And all the multitude of them having risen, brought him to Pilate.
{23:2} And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying himself to be Christ a King.
{23:3} And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou King of the Jews? And he having answered, said to him, Thou sayest.
{23:4} And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, I find nothing blameworthy in this man.
{23:5} And they were strong, saying, That he stirs up the people, teaching through the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee to here.
{23:6} And Pilate having heard of Galilee, asked if the man is a Galilean.
{23:7} And having known that he is from Herod's authority, he sent him to Herod, he being in Jerusalem in those days.
{23:8} And Herod having seen Jesus, rejoiced greatly: for he was wishing a long while since to see him, for hearing many things of him: and he hoped to see some sign done by him.
{23:9} And he asked him in fitting words: and he answered him nothing.
{23:10} And the chief priests and scribes stood zealously accusing him.
{23:11} And Herod having set him at nought with his troops, and having mocked, putting about him shining clothing, sent him out to Pilate.
{23:12} And also Pilate and Herod were friends in that day with one another: for they were before being in enmity with each other.
{23:13} And Pilate having called together the chief priests and rulers and people,
{23:14} Said to them, Ye have brought to me this man, as perverting the people: and, behold, I having examined him before you, have found nothing blameworthy in this man, of what things ye bring an accusation against him:
{23:15} But neither Herod: for I sent you forth to him; and, behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him.
{23:16} Therefore, having chastised him, I will release.
{23:17} (And he had necessity to loose one at the festival.)
{23:18} And they cried out with the entire multitude, saying, Take this away, and loose to us Barabbas:
{23:19} (Who was for a certain sedition having been in the city, and slaughter, cast into prison.)
{23:20} Again Pilate called, wishing to loose Jesus.
{23:21} And they exclaimed, saying, Crucify, crucify him.
{23:22} And he said to them the third time, For what evil has he done I have found no cause of death in him: therefore, having corrected him, I will loose.
{23:23} And they were urgent with great voices, asking for him to be crucified. And their voices and the chief priests overcame.
{23:24} And Pilate sanctioned their asking to be done.
{23:25} And he loosed to them him cast into prison for sedition, and slaughter, which they demanded; and delivered Jesus to their will.
{23:26} And as they led him away, seizing upon Simon, a certain Cyrenian, coming from the field, they laid the cross upon him, to carry after Jesus.
{23:27} And a great multitude of people followed him, and of women, and who were lamenting bitterly, and bewailing him.
{23:28} And having turned towards them Jesus said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
{23:29} For, behold, the days are coming in which they shall say, Happy the barren, and the wombs which never brought forth, and the breasts which gave not suck.
{23:30} Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us; and to the hills, Cover us.
{23:31} For if they do these in the moist tree, what should be in the dry.
{23:32} And two others who were led, evil doers, to be lifted up with him.
{23:33} And when they came to the place called Kranium, there they crucified him, and the evil doers, truly one from the right, and one from the left.
{23:34} And Jesus said, Father, let them go; for they know not what they do. And having divided his garments, they cast lots.
{23:35} And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also who with them were deriding, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he is Christ, the chosen of God.
{23:36} And the soldiers also mocked him, approaching, and bringing him vinegar.
{23:37} And saying, If thou art king of the Jews, save thyself.
{23:38} And there was also an inscription written upon him, in letters Greek, Roman, and Hebrew; THIS IS KING OF THE JEWS.
{23:39} And one of the evil doers hanged, blasphemed him, saying, If thou art Christ, save thyself and us.
{23:40} And the other having answered, censured him, saying, Shouldest thou not fear God, for thou art in the same judgment?
{23:41} And truly we justly; for we receive things worthy of what we have done: and this has done nothing out of place.
{23:42} And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when thou shouldest come into thy kingdom.
{23:43} And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, This day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
{23:44} And it was about the sixth hour, and darkness was upon all the earth till the ninth hour.
{23:45} And the sun was darkened, and the covering of the temple was split in the middle.
{23:46} And Jesus having cried with a great voice, said, Father, into thy hands will I commit my spirit: and having said these, he expired.
{23:47} And the centurion having seen that having been done, honoured God, saying, Surely this man was just.
{23:48} And all the crowds having been to this viewing, seeing the things done, striking their breasts, returned.
{23:49} And all his acquaintance stood afar off, and the women having followed him together from Galilee, seeing these.
{23:50} And, behold, a man Joseph by name, being a counsellor; good and just:
{23:51} (The same was not set together in the counsel and deed of them;) from Arimathea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
{23:52} The same having come to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus.
{23:53} And having taken it down, he wrapped it in fine linen, and put it in a tomb cut in stone, where none was ever laid.
{23:54} And the day was the preparation, and the sabbath shone forth.
{23:55} And the women having followed, which had come to him out of Galilee, saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.
{23:56} And having returned, they prepared spices and perfumed oils; and truly the sabbath were they at rest according to the command.
{24:1} And in one of the sabbaths, in the depth of the dawn of day, they came to the tomb, bringing spices which they had prepared, and certain with them.
{24:2} And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
{24:3} And coming in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
{24:4} And it was in their being perplexed for this, and, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
{24:5} And they having, been afraid, and bending the face to the earth, they said to them, Why seek ye the living with the dead.
{24:6} He is not here, but has risen: remember how he spake to you being yet in Galilee,
{24:7} Saying, That the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and be raised up the third day.
{24:8} And they remembered his words,
{24:9} And having returned from the tomb, they announced these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
{24:10} And they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the rest with them, who said these things to the sent.
{24:11} And their words appeared before them as idle talk, and they believed them not.
{24:12} And Peter having risen, ran to the tomb; and having stooped, saw the linen bandages lying alone, and he departed, wondering in himself at what was done.
{24:13} And, behold, two of them were going in the same day to a town being about sixty stadia from Jerusalem, the name of which Emmaus.
{24:14} And they were conversing with one another concerning all things having happened.
{24:15} And it was in their conversing and seeking out together, and Jesus himself, having drawn near, went with them.
{24:16} And their eyes were holden not to know him.
{24:17} And he said to them, What words these which, walking about, ye discuss with one another, and are of gloomy aspect?
{24:18} And one having answered, to whom the name Cleopas, said to him, Sojournest thou alone in Jerusalem, and knowest not the things done in it in these days?
{24:19} And Jesus said to them, What things? And they said to him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarite, who was a man, a prophet, powerful in work and words before God and all the people:
{24:20} And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to the judgment of death, and crucified him.
{24:21} And we hoped that this is he about to redeem Israel: but also with all these things, to day it brings the third day from which these things were.
{24:22} And also certain women of ours moved us out of place, having been early at the tomb;
{24:23} And not finding his body, they came, saying also to have seen a vision of messengers, who say he is living.
{24:24} And certain of them with us departed to the tomb, and found so as the women said: and him they saw not.
{24:25} And he said to them, O ye unwise, and slow in heart to believe in all things which the prophets spake:
{24:26} Must not Christ suffer these things, and enter into his glory?
{24:27} And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained clearly to them in all the writings concerning himself.
{24:28} And they drew near to the town where they were going: and he laid claim to go still further.
{24:29} And they constrained him, saying, Remain with us: for it is near eve, and the day has declined. And he went in to remain with them.
{24:30} And it was in his reclining at table with them, having taken bread, he praised, and having broken, bestowed upon them.
{24:31} And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he was removed from their view.
{24:32} And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning in us, as he spake to us in the way, and as he opened the writings to us.
{24:33} And having risen the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those with them.
{24:34} Saying, That truly the Lord was risen, and was seen to Simon.
{24:35} And they recounted the things in the way, and how he was known to them in the breaking of bread.
{24:36} And they speaking these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and he says to them, Peace to you.
{24:37} And they, struck with awe and being afraid, thought to see a spirit.
{24:38} And he said to them, Why have ye been troubled? and wherefore do reflections come up in your hearts?
{24:39} See my hands and my feet, for I am he; feel, and see: for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as ye see me having.
{24:40} And having said this, he showed them hands and feet.
{24:41} And yet they not believing from joy, and wondering, he said to them, Have ye any food here?
{24:42} And they bestowed upon him part of a broiled fish, and of an honey comb.
{24:43} And having taken, he ate before them.
{24:44} And he said to them, These the words which I spake to you, being yet with you, for all things must be completed, written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me.
{24:45} Then opened he their understanding, to understand the writings,
{24:46} And he said to them, That so has it been written, and so was it necessary for Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
{24:47} And repentance and remission of sins to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, having begun from Jerusalem.
{24:48} And ye are witnesses of these things.
{24:49} And, behold, I send the solemn promise of my Father upon you: and do ye sit in the city of Jerusalem, till ye be clothed with power from on high.
{24:50} And he led them without, even to Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he praised them.
{24:51} And it was in his praising them, he was separated from them, and carried into heaven.
{24:52} And they having worshipped him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
{24:53} And they were always in the temple, praising and extolling God. Amen.
