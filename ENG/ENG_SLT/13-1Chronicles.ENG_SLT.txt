{12:14} These from the sons of Gad, heads of the army: one to a hundred the small, and the great to a thousand.
{12:15} These they who passed over Jordan in the first month, and it filling over all its banks; and they drove out all the valleys to the sunrising find to the west.
{12:16} And there will come from the sons of Benjamin and Judah even to the fortress to David:
{12:17} And David will go forth before them, and he will answer and say to them, If for peace ye came to me to help me, the heart will be together with you: and if to deceive me to mine enemy, in not being violence in my hand, the God of our fathers will see and decide.
{12:18} And the spirit clothed Amasai, head of the thirty: To thee David, and with thee, son of Jesse: peace, peace to thee, and peace to thy help; for thy God helped thee. And David will receive them and give them for heads of the troops.
{12:19} And from Manasseh there fell to David in his going with the rovers against Saul to war; and he helped them not, for in counsel the princes of the rovers sent him away, saying, With our heads he will fall to his lord Saul.
{12:20} In his going to Ziklag there fell to him from Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael and Jozabad, Elihu, and Zilthai, the heads to the thousands which were to Manasseh.
{12:21} And they helped with David against the troops: for strong ones of power all of them, and they will be chiefs in the army.
{12:22} For at the time day by day they will come to David to he him, even a great camp as the camp of God.
{12:23} And these the numbers of heads drawn out for the army, they came to David to Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul to him according to the mouth of Jehovah.

{12:30} From the sons of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred strong ones of power, men of names to the house of their fathers.
{12:31} And from half the tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand who were distinguished by names, to come to make David king.
{12:32} And from the sons of Issachar, those knowing the understanding to the times to know what Israel shall do; their heads two hundred; and all their brethren at their mouth.
{12:33} From Zebulon coming forth to the army, setting the battle in array with all the utensils of war, fifty thousand to set in order, with not a heart and a heart.
{12:34} And from Naphtali a thousand chiefs, and with them with shield and spear, thirty and seven thousand.

{12:37} And from beyond Jordan, from the Reubenites and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, with all utensils of the army of the war, a hundred and twenty thousand.
{12:38} All these men of war setting in order the arrangement with the whole heart, came to Hebron to make David king over all Israel: and also all the rest of Israel of one heart to make David king.
{12:39} And they will be there with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren prepared for them.
{12:40} And also those being near to them, even to Issachar, and Zebulon, and Naphtali, bringing bread upon asses and upon camels, and upon mules, and upon oxen; food of flour, round cakes, and dried grapes, and wine and oil, and oxen and sheep for multitude: for joy in Israel.
{13:1} And David will counsel with the chiefs of the thousands and the hundreds, to every leader.
{13:2} And David will say to all the convocation of Israel, If good to you, and from Jehovah our God, we will break forth, we will send to all our brethren being left in all the lands of Israel; and with them the priests and the Levites in the cities of their areas, and they shall gather together to us.
{13:3} And we will turn about the ark of our God to us: for we sought it not in the days of Saul.
{13:4} And all the convocation will say to do thus: for the word was straight in the eyes of all the people.
{13:5} And David will convoke together all Israel from Sihor of Egypt and even to the going in of Hamath, to bring in the ark of God from the cities of the forests.
{13:6} And David will go up, and all Israel, to Baalah, to the cities of the forests which were to Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God Jehovah dwelling in the cherubims, which the name was called.
{13:7} And they caused the ark of God to ride upon a new wagon from the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and his brethren conducting in the wagon.
{13:8} And David and all Israel playing before God with all strength, and with songs and with harps, and with lyres, and with drums, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
{13:9} And they will come to the threshing-floor of Chidon, and Uzza will stretch forth his hand to hold firm the ark; for the oxen thrust it.
{13:10} And the anger of Jehovah will be kindled against Uzza, and he will strike him for that he stretched forth his hand upon the ark: and he will die their before God.
{13:11} And it will kindle to David because Jehovah broke forth a breach upon Uzza: and he will call to this place, This the Breach of Uzza, even to this day.
{13:12} And David will fear God in that day, saying, How shall I bring to me the ark of God?
{13:13} And David removed not the ark of God from the city of David, and he will turn it away to the house of Obed-Edom the Gathite.
{13:14} And the ark of God will dwell with the house of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And Jehovah will bless the house of Obed-Edom, and all which is to him.
{14:1} And Hiram king of Tyre will send messengers to David, and trees of cedars and workmen of the wall and workmen of woods to build for him a house.
{14:2} And David knew that Jehovah prepared him for king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up to above on account of his people Israel.
{14:3} And David will take yet wives in Jerusalem: and David will yet beget sons and daughters.
{14:4} And these the names of the children which were to him in Jerusalem; Shamus, and Shobab, Nathan and Solomon.
{14:5} And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elphalet,
{14:6} And Nogah and Nepheg, and Japhia,
{14:7} And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.
{14:8} And the rovers will hear that David was anointed for king over all Israel, and all the rovers will come up to seek David. And David will hear and he will go forth before them.
{14:9} And the rovers came and they will spread out in the valley of the shades.
{14:10} And David will ask in God, saying, Shall I go up against the rovers? and gavest thou them into my hand? and Jehovah will say to him, Go up; and I gave them into thy hand.
{14:11} And they will go up to the master of breaches, and David will strike them there. And David will say, God broke forth upon mine enemies by my hand as the breaking forth of waters: for this they called the name of that place, The Master of the Breaches.
{14:12} And they will leave their gods there, and David will say, and they will burn in fire.
{14:13} And the rovers will yet add, and they will spread out in the valley.
{14:14} And David will yet ask in God: and God will say to him, Thou shalt not go up after them; turn about from off them, and go to them from the front of the weepings.
{14:15} And it will be in thy hearing a voice of the goings in the heads of the weepings, then thou shall go forth in war: for God will go forth before thee to strike the camp of the rovers.
{14:16} And David will do as Jehovah commanded him: and they will strike the camp of the rovers from Gibeon even to Gaza.
{14:17} And the name of David will go forth into all lands; and Jehovah gave his fear upon all the nations.
{15:1} And he will make to himself houses in the city of David, and, he will prepare a place for the ark of God, and will spread for it a tent.
{15:2} Then David said, None to lift up the ark of God but the Levites: for in them God chose to lift up the ark of God, and to serve him even to forever.
{15:3} And David will convoke all Israel together to Jerusalem, to lift up the ark of Jehovah to its place which he prepared for it.
{15:4} And David will gather together the sons of Aaron and the Levites:
{15:5} To the sons of Kohath: Uriel the chief and his brethren, a hundred and twenty:

{15:11} And David will call for Zadok and for Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel and Aminadab,
{15:12} And he will say to them, Ye heads of the fathers to the Levites: ye shall purify yourselves, ye and your brethren, and bring ye up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel to that I prepared for it.
{15:13} For ye not from the first, Jehovah our God broke forth upon us, for we sought him not according to judgment.
{15:14} And the priests will purify themselves and the Levites to bring up the ark of Jehovah God of Israel.
{15:15} And the sons of the Levites will lift up the ark of God as Moses commanded, according to the word of Jehovah, upon the shoulders, with the rods upon them.
{15:16} And David will say to the chiefs of the Levites to cause their brethren to stand singing with every instrument of song, lyres and harps, and cymbals, causing to hear to lift up with the voice for joy.
{15:17} And the Levites wilt set up Heman son of Joel; and from his brethren, Asaph son of Berechiah; and from the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan son of Kushaiah;
{15:18} And with them their brethren being second, Zechariah the son, and Jahaziel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, Jeiel, gate-keepers.
{15:19} And those singing, Heman, Asaph and Ethan, with cymbals of brass to cause to hear;

{15:24} And Shebaniah and Jehoshaphat, and Nathaniel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests, trumpeting with trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-Edom and Jehiah, gate-keepers to the ark.
{15:25} And David will be, and the old men of Israel and the chiefs of thousands, going to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the house of Obed-Edom with joy.
{15:26} And it will be in God's helping the Levites lifting up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and they will sacrifice seven bullocks and seven rams.
{15:27} And David being girded with an upper garment of byssus, and all the Levites lifting up the ark and those singing, and Chenaniah the chief of the lifting up of those singing: and upon David an ephod of linen.
{15:28} And all Israel bringing up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with a signal and with the voice of the horn, and with trumpets and with cymbals causing to hear, and with lyres and harps.
{15:29} And the ark of the covenant of Jehovah will be coming even to the city of David, and Michel daughter of Saul, looking forth from a window, and she will see king David leaping and playing: and she will despise him in her heart.
{16:1} And they will bring the ark of God and set it in the midst of the tent which David stretched out for it: and they will bring near burnt-offerings and peace before God.
{16:2} And David will finish the bringing up of the burnt-offering and the peace, and he will bless the people in the name of Jehovah.
{16:3} And he will divide to every man of Israel from man and even to woman, to each a round of bread, and a measure and cakes.
{16:4} And he will give before the ark of Jehovah from the Levites serving, and for keeping in remembrance, and to confess and to praise to Jehovah God of Israel.
{16:5} Asaph the head, and his second, Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-Edom: and Jeiel with instruments of lyres and harps; and Asaph with trumpets causing to hear;
{16:6} And Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
{16:7} In that day thus David gave at the first to confess to Jehovah by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
{16:8} Confess ye to Jehovah, call upon his name, make known among the peoples his deeds.
{16:9} Sing ye to him, play on the harp to him, speak upon all his wonders.
{16:10} Praise ye in his holy name: the heart of those seeking Jehovah shall rejoice.
{16:11} Seek ye Jehovah and his strength, seek his face always.
{16:12} Remember ye his wonders which he did, and his miracles, and the judgments of his mouth;
{16:13} O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye sons of Jacob his chosen ones.
{16:14} He Jehovah our God; in all the earth his judgments.
{16:15} Remember ye forever his covenant; the word be commanded to a thousand generations;
{16:16} Which he cut out with Abraham, and his oath to Isaak.
{16:17} And he will cause it to stand to Jacob for a law, to Israel a covenant forever,
{16:18} Saying, To thee I will give the land of Canaan, the cord of your inheritance;
{16:19} In your being men of number, as few, and strangers in it.
{16:20} And they will go about from nation to nation, and from kingdom to another people;
{16:21} And he permitted not to a man to oppress them: and for them he will reprove kings:
{16:22} Ye shall not touch upon my Messiah, and upon my prophets ye shall not do evil.
{16:23} Sing ye to Jehovah, all the earth; announce good news, from day to day his salvation.
{16:24} Recount his glory among the nations; his wonders among all peoples.
{16:25} For great is Jehovah, and greatly praised: and he to be feared above all gods.
{16:26} For all the gods of the peoples nothings: and Jehovah made the heavens.
{16:27} Glory and honor before his face; strength and joy in his place.
{16:28} Give to Jehovah ye families of the peoples, give to Jehovah glory and strength.
{16:29} Give ye to Jehovah the glory of his name: lift up a gift and come before him: worship to Jehovah the ornaments of holiness.
{16:30} Tremble from before him, all ye earth: also the habitable globe shall be set up, it shall not be shaken.
{16:31} The heavens shall rejoice, and the earth shall exult: and they shall say among the nations, Jehovah reigned:
{16:32} The sea shall tremble and its fulness, and the field shall rejoice and all that is in it.
{16:33} Then shall the trees of the forest shout from the face of Jehovah, for he came to judge the earth.
{16:34} Confess ye to Jehovah, for he is good, for his mercy is forever.
{16:35} And say ye, Save us, God of our salvation, and gather us together and deliver us from the nations, to confess to thy holy name, to glory in thy praise.
{16:36} Praised be Jehovah God of Israel from forever and even to forever. And all the people will say, Amen, and praise to Jehovah.
{16:37} And he will leave there before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to Asaph and to his brethren, to serve before the ark always, for the word of a day in its day.
{16:38} And Obed-Edom and his brethren, sixty and eight; and Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun and Hosah for gate-keepers:
{16:39} And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the dwelling of Jehovah in the height which is in Gibeon.
{16:40} To bring up burnt-offerings to Jehovah upon the altar of burnt-offering always at morning and at evening, and according to all written in the law of Jehovah which he charged upon Israel;
{16:41} And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest being chosen, who were separated by names to confess to Jehovah: for his mercy is forever.
{16:42} And with them Heman and Jeduthun, with trumpets and cymbals to cause to hear, and instruments of song of God. And the sons of Jeduthun at the gate.
{16:43} And all the people will go each to his house: and David will turn about to bless his house.
{17:1} And it will be as David will sit in his house, and David will say to Nathan the prophet, Behold me dwelling in a house of cedars, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah under curtains.
{17:2} And Nathan will say to David, Do all that is thy heart; for God is with thee.
{17:3} And it will be in that night, and the word of God will be to Nathan, saying,
{17:4} Go and say to David my servant, Thus said Jehovah, Thou shalt not build to me a house to dwell in:
{17:5} For I dwelt not in a house from the day that I brought up Israel even to this day: and I will be from tent to tent, and from a dwelling.
{17:6} In all that I went about in all Israel, spake I the word with one of the judges of Israel that I commanded to feed my people, saying, Wherefore built ye not to me a house of cedars.
{17:7} And now, thus shalt thou say to my servant, to David, Thus said Jehovah of armies, I took thee from the dwelling from behind the flocks to be leader over my people Israel:
{17:8} And I will be with thee in all which thou walkedst, and I will cut off all thine enemies from thy face, and I made to thee a name as the name of the great ones which are in the earth.
{17:9} And I set a place for my people Israel, and I planted him, and he dwelt in his place, and he shall no more be disturbed; and the sons of evil shall not add to vex him, as in the beginning.
{17:10} And to the days which I commanded judges over my people Israel; and I brought low all thine enemies. And I will announce to thee, and Jehovah will build a house to thee.
{17:11} And it was When thy days were completed to go with thy fathers, and I raised up thy seed after thee, which shall be from thy sons; and I prepared his kingdom.
{17:12} He shall build to me a house, and I prepared his throne even to forever.
{17:13} I will be to him for father, and he shall be to me for son: and my mercy will I not remove from him as I removed from him being before thee.
{17:14} And I caused him to stand in my house and in my kingdom even to forever: and his throne shall be set up even to forever.
{17:15} According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so spake Nathan the prophet to David.
{17:16} And king David will come and sit before Jehovah, and he will say, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what my house, that thou broughtest me even to hither?
{17:17} And this will be small in thine eyes, O God; and thou wilt speak upon the house of thy servant to far off, and thou sawest me according to the manner of the man of the ascent, O Jehovah God.
{17:18} What more shall David add to thee to honor thy servant? for thou knewest thy servant.
{17:19} O Jehovah, for sake of thy servant, and according to thy heart, thou didst all this greatness to make known all thy greatnesses.
{17:20} O Jehovah, none like thee, and no God besides thee, in all that we heard with our ears.
{17:21} And what one nation as thy people Israel, in the earth, whom God went to redeem to him a people to set up to thee a name of greatnesses and terrible things, to thrust out nations from before thy people, whom thou didst redeem from Egypt?
{17:22} And thou wilt give thy people Israel to thee for a people even to forever; and thou, O Jehovah, wert to them for God.
{17:23} And now, O Jehovah, the word which thou spakest concerning thy servant and concerning his house, shall be faithful even to forever, and do as thou spakest.
{17:24} And it shall be firm, and thy name shall be magnified even to forever, saying, Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, is God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant was prepared before thee.
{17:25} For thou, my God, didst uncover the ear of thy servant to build for him a house: for this thy servant found to pray before thee.
{17:26} And now, O Jehovah, thou thyself art God, and thou wilt speak concerning thy servant this goodness.
{17:27} And now thou wert pleased to bless the house of thy servant, to be forever before thee: for thou didst bless, and blessing forever.
{18:1} And it will be after this, and David will strike the rovers, and he will subdue them, and take Gath and her daughters from the hand of the rovers.
{18:2} And he will strike Moab; and Moab will be servants to David, lifting up a gift.

{18:7} And David will take the shields of gold that were upon the servants of Hadarezer, and he will bring them to Jerusalem.
{18:8} And from Tibhath and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much brass; with it Solomon made the sea of brass, and the pillars and the vessels of brass.
{18:9} And Tou, king of Hamath, will hear that David struck all the power of Hadarezer king of Zobah;
{18:10} And he will send Hadoram his son to king David to ask to him for peace and to bless him because he fought against Hadarezer, and he will strike him; (for Hadarezer was a man of war with Tou;) and all vessels of gold and silver and brass.
{18:11} Also them king David consecrated to Jehovah, with the silver and the gold which he lifted up from all the nations from Edom, from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, and from the rovers, and from Amalek.
{18:12} And Abishai son of Zeruiah struck Edom in the valley of salt, eighteen thousand.
{18:13} And be will set up garrisons in Edom; and all Edom will be servants to David. And Jehovah will save David in all which he went.
{18:14} And David will reign over all Israel, and he will be doing judgment and justice to all his people.

{19:1} And it will be after this, Nahash king of the sons of Ammon will die, and his son will reign in his stead.
{19:2} And David will say, I will do mercy with Hanun son of Nahash, for his father did mercy with me. And David will send messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David's servants will come to the land of the sons of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
{19:3} And the chiefs of the sons of Ammon will say to Hanun, Is David honoring thy father in thine eyes, that he sent comforters to thee? is it not in order to search out, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land, came his servants to thee?
{19:4} And Hanun will take David's servants and shave them, and cut off their garments in the half, even to the step, and he will send them away.
{19:5} And they will go and announce to David concerning the men; and he will send to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king will say, Sit in Jericho till your beard shall spring up, and turn ye back.
{19:6} And the sons of Ammon will see that they were loathsome with David, and Hanun will send, and the sons of Ammon, a thousand talents of silver to hire to them from Aram of the rivers and from Aram-Maachah, and from Zobah, chariots and horsemen.
{19:7} And they will hire to them two and thirty thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people, and they will come and encamp before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon were gathered together from their cities, and they will come to the battle.
{19:8} And David will hear, and he will send Joab and all the army of strong ones.
{19:9} And the sons of Ammon will go forth and set the battle in array at the entrance of the city: and the kings that came by themselves into the field.
{19:10} And Joab will see that the face of the battle Was against him, before and behind; and he will choose from all the young men in Israel, and he will set in array to meet Aram.
{19:11} And the rest of the people he gave into the hand of Abishai his brother, and he will set in array to meet the sons of Ammon.
{19:12} And he will say, If Aram shall be strong above me, and thou wert to me for salvation: and if the sons of Ammon shall be strong above thee, and I saved thee.
{19:13} Be strong, and we will strengthen ourselves for our people and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah will do the good in his eyes.
{19:14} And Joab will draw near, and the people which are with him, before Aram to battle; and they will flee from before him.
{19:15} And the sons of Ammon saw that Aram fled, and they will flee also themselves from the face of Abishai his brother, and they will come into the city. And Joab will come to Jerusalem.
{19:16} And Aram will see that they were smitten before Israel, and they will send messengers and bring forth Aram that was from beyond the river: and Shophach the chief of the army of Hadarezer before them.
{19:17} And it will be announced to David; and he will gather together all Israel, and he will pass over Jordan and come against them, and he will set in array against them. And David will set the battle in array to meet Aram, and they will wage war with him.

{19:19} And the servants of Hadarezer will see that they were smitten before Israel, and they will be at peace with David, and will serve him: and Aram would no more help the sons of Ammon.
{20:1} And it will be at the time of the return of the year, at the time of the going forth of kings, and Joab will lead the power of the army, and he will destroy the land of the sons of Ammon, and he will come and press upon Rabbah: and David dwelt in Jerusalem. And Joab will strike Rabbah and destroy it.
{20:2} And David will take the crown of their king from off his head, and he will find the weight a talent of gold, and in it precious stone; and it will be upon David's head: and he brought forth the spoil of the city exceeding much.
{20:3} And he brought out the people that were in it, and he will contend with the saw and with threshing-sledges of iron, and with saws. And David will do thus to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David will turn back and all the people, to Jerusalem.
{20:4} And it will be after this and war will stand up in Gezer with the rovers: then Sibbechai the Hushathite struck Sippai from the children of Rapha, and they will be subdued.
{20:5} And there will be yet war with the rovers; and Elhanan son of Jair will strike Lahmi the brother of Goliah the Gathite, and the wood of his spear as a weaver's beam.
{20:6} And there will be yet war in Gath; and there will be a man of measure, and his fingers six and six, twenty and four: and he also was born to Rapha.
{20:7} And he will reproach Israel, and Jonathan son of Shimea, David's brother, struck him.
{20:8} These were born to Rapha in Gath; and they will fall by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
{21:1} And an adversary will stand up against Israel, and he will stimulate David to number Israel.
{21:2} And David will say to Joab and to the chiefs of the people, Go number Israel from the well of the oath even to judgment, and bring to me and I shall know their number.
{21:3} And Joab will say, Jehovah will add to his people as they are, a hundred times: are they not, my lord the king, all of them for servants to my lord? for what will my lord seek this? wherefore will he be for trespass to Israel?
{21:4} And the word of the king was strong upon Joab. And Joab will go forth, and he will go about in all Israel, and he will come to Jerusalem.
{21:5} And Joab will give the number of reviewing the people to David. And all Israel will be a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men drawing sword: and Judah four hundred and seventy thousand men drawing sword.
{21:6} And Levi and Benjamin he reviewed not in the midst of them: for the king's word was abhorred with Joab.
{21:7} And it will be evil in the eyes of God concerning this word, and he will strike Israel.
{21:8} And David will say to God, I sinned greatly that I did this word: and now cause to pass away now the iniquity of thy servant, for I acted very foolishly.
{21:9} And Jehovah will speak to Gad the seer of David, saying,
{21:10} Go and speak to David, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Three, I stretch forth upon thee; choose to thee one from these and I will do to thee.
{21:11} And Gad will come to David and say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Take to thee,
{21:12} If three years of famine, and if three months of being destroyed from before thine adversaries, and the sword of thine enemies to overtake; and if three days the sword of Jehovah, and the word in the land, and the messenger of Jehovah destroying in all the bound of Israel. And now see what word I shall turn back to him sending me.
{21:13} And David will say to Gad, Straits to me exceedingly: I will fall now into the hand of Jehovah, for his compassions are very many: and I will not fall into the hand of man.
{21:14} And Jehovah will give death upon Israel: and there will fall from Israel seventy thousand men.
{21:15} And God will send a messenger to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he destroyed, Jehovah saw, and he will grieve for the evil, and he will say to the messenger destroying, Enough; slacken thy hand. And the messenger of Jehovah stood by the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite.
{21:16} And David will lift up his eyes and see the messenger of Jehovah standing between the earth and between the heavens, and his sword drawn in his hand stretched forth over Jerusalem. And David will fall, and the old men being covered with sackcloth, upon their face.
{21:17} And David will say to God, Is it not I who said to number in the people? and I am he who sinned, and doing evil I did evil; and these sheep, what did they? O Jehovah my God, thy hand now shall be upon me and upon my father's house; and not to smite upon thy people.
{21:18} And the messenger of Jehovah said to Gad to say to David that David shall go up to set up an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite.
{21:19} And David will go up at the word of Gad which he spake in the name of Jehovah.
{21:20} And Ornan will turn back and see the messenger; and his four sons with him hiding themselves. And Ornan treading out the wheat.
{21:21} And David will go even to Ornan, and Ornan will look and see David, and he will go forth from the threshing-floor, and he will worship to David, the face to the earth.
{21:22} And David will say to Ornan, Thou shalt give to me the place of the threshing-floor, and I will build in it an altar to Jehovah: for the full silver thou shalt give it to me, and the smiting shall be restrained from the people.
{21:23} And Ornan will say to David, Take to thee, and my lord the king shall, do the good in his eyes: see, I gave the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing-sledges for woods, and the wheat for a gift; I gave all.
{21:24} And king David will say to Ornan, Nay; for buying, I will buy for the full silver: for I will not lift up what is to thee to Jehovah, and bring up burnt-offerings gratuitously.
{21:25} And David will give to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold from weight.
{21:26} And David will build there an alter to Jehovah, and he will bring up burnt-offerings and peace, and will call to Jehovah; and he will answer him in fire from the heavens upon the altar of burnt-offering.
{21:27} And Jehovah will say to the messenger, and he will turn back his sword to its sheath.
{21:28} In that time in David's seeing that Jehovah answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, and he will sacrifice there.
{21:29} And the dwelling of Jehovah which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of burnt-offering in that time in the height in Gibeon.
{21:30} And David could not go before it to seek God, for he was afraid from the face of the sword of the messenger of Jehovah,
{22:1} And David will say, This house itself of Jehovah God, and this the altar for burnt-offering to Israel.
{22:2} And David will say to assemble the strangers which are in the land of Israel; and he will set up hewers of stone to hew out hewn stones to build the house of God.
{22:3} And iron for abundance for nails for the doors of the gates, and for the junctions, David prepared; and brass for abundance no weight;
{22:4} And cedar woods to no number: for the Zidonians and the Tyrians brought cedar woods for multitude to David.
{22:5} And David will say, Solomon my son a youth and tender, and the house to be built for Jehovah to be great for going up for a name and for glory to all the lands: I will now prepare for it. And David will prepare for abundance before his death.
{22:6} And he will call for Solomon his son, and he will command him to build a house to Jehovah God of Israel.
{22:7} And David will say to Solomon his son, I, it was with my heart to build a house to the name of Jehovah my God.
{22:8} And the word of Jehovah will be upon me, saying, Thou didst pour out blood for abundance, and didst make great wars: thou shalt not build a house for my name, for thou didst pour out many bloods in the earth before me.
{22:9} Behold, a son being born to thee, he shall be a man of rest; and I caused rest to him from all his enemies from round about: for Solomon shall be his name, and I will give peace and quiet upon Israel in his days.
{22:10} He shall build a house to my name; and he shall be to me for son, and I to him for father; and I prepared the throne of his kingdom over Israel even to forever.
{22:11} Now, my son, Jehovah will be with thee; and prosper thou and build the house of Jehovah thy God as he spake concerning thee.
{22:12} Surely Jehovah will give to thee wisdom and understanding, and he will command thee concerning Israel, and to watch the law of Jehovah thy God.
{22:13} Then thou shalt prosper if thou shalt watch to do the laws and the judgments which Jehovah commanded Moses concerning Israel: be strong and be active; thou shalt not fear and thou shalt not be terrified.
{22:14} And behold in my affliction I prepared for the house of Jehovah, gold, a hundred thousand talents, and silver, a thousand thousand talents; and for brass and for iron, no weight; for it was for abundance: and woods and stones I prepared, and upon them thou wilt add.
{22:15} And with thee for abundance, they doing the work, hewers and workmen of stone and wood, and all the wise for all the work.
{22:16} To gold, to silver, and to brass, and to iron, no number. Arise and do, and Jehovah will be with thee.
{22:17} And David will command to all the chiefs of Israel for help to Solomon his son:
{22:18} Is not Jehovah your God with you? and he caused rest to you from round about? for he gave into my hand the inhabitants of the land; and the land was subdued before Jehovah, and before his people.
{22:19} Now ye shall give your heart and your soul to seek to Jehovah your God; and arise ye and build the holy place of Jehovah God to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and the holy vessels of God, to the house being built to the name of Jehovah.
{23:1} And David was old and full of days, and he will make Solomon his son king over Israel.
{23:2} And he will gather together all the chiefs of Israel, and the priests and the Levites.
{23:3} And the Levites will be numbered from the son of thirty years and above: and their number, for their craniums, for the men, thirty and eight thousand.
{23:4} From these to superintend over the work of the house of Jehovah, twenty and four thousand; and scribes and judges, six thousand:
{23:5} And four thousand gate keepers, and four thousand praising to Jehovah with instruments which I made to praise.
{23:6} And David will divide them into divisions to the sons of Levi, to Gershon, Kohath and Merari.

{23:12} The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel, four.
{23:13} The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses: and Aaron will be separated for his consecrating the holy of holies, he and his sons, even to forever, to burn incense before Jehovah to serve him and to praise in his name, even to forever.

{23:24} These the sons of Levi for the house of their fathers: the heads of the fathers for their reviewing by the number of names to their craniums doing the work for the service of the house of Jehovah, from the son of twenty years and above.
{23:25} For David said, Jehovah God of Israel caused rest to his people, and they will dwell in Jerusalem forever;
{23:26} And also to the Levites: not to lift up the dwelling and all its vessels for its service.
{23:27} For by the last words of David these the number of the sons of Levi from the son of twenty years and above.
{23:28} For from their station at the hand of the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah, upon the enclosures and upon the cells and for the cleansing to all the holy place and the works of the service of the house of God.

{27:32} And Jehonathan, David's uncle, counseling a man of understanding, and he a scribe: and Jehiel son of Hachmoni with the sons of the king:
{27:33} And Ahithophel counseling to the king: and Hushai the Archite the friend of the king:
{27:34} And after Ahithophel, Jeboida son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the chief of the army to the king, Joab.
{28:1} And David will convoke together all the chiefs of Israel, the chiefs of the tribes and the chiefs of the divisions serving the king, and the chiefs of the thousands and the chiefs of the hundreds, and the chiefs of all the possessions and the cattle to the king and to his sons, with the eunuchs, and the strong ones, and to every one strong of power to Jerusalem.
{28:2} And David the king will rise upon his feet and say, Hear me, my brethren and my people: I with my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and for the footstool of the feet of our God; and I prepared for the building.
{28:3} And God said to me, Thou shalt not build a house to my name, for thou a man of war, and thou didst pour out bloods.
{28:4} And Jehovah God of Israel will choose in me from all the house of my father to be for king over Israel forever: for in Judah he chose for leader; and in the house of Judah the house of my father; and in the sons of my father he delighted in me to make a king over all Israel:
{28:5} And from all my sons (for Jehovah gave to me many sons) and he will choose in Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of Jehovah over Israel.
{28:6} And he will say to me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my enclosures: for I chose in him to me for son, and I will be to him for father.
{28:7} And I set up his kingdom even to forever, if he shall be strong to do my commands and my judgments as this day.
{28:8} And now before the eyes of all Israel, the convocation of Jehovah, and in the ears of our God, watch ye and seek all the commands of Jehovah your God, so that ye shall inherit the good land, and give an inheritance to your sons after you even to forever.
{28:9} And thou, O Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing soul: for Jehovah searched all hearts, and he understands every formation of the thoughts: if thou shalt seek him he will be found to thee, and if thou wilt forsake him, he will cast thee off forever.
{28:10} See now; for Jehovah chose in thee to build a house for a holy place: be strong and do.
{28:11} And David will give to Solomon his son a pattern of the porch, and its houses, and its treasuries, and its upper chambers, and its apartments within, and the house of the expiation.
{28:12} And the pattern of all that was in the spirit with him for the enclosures of the house of Jehovah, and for all the cells round about for the treasures of the house of God, and for the treasures of the holies:
{28:13} And for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and for all the vessels of the service of the house of Jehovah.
{28:14} For the gold by weight for the gold, for all the vessels of service; and for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all the vessels of service and service:
{28:15} And the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and their lamps of gold, by weight of the candlestick and candlestick, and its lamps: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, for the candlestick and its lamps, according to the service of candlestick and candlestick.
{28:16} And the gold of the weight for the tables of the arrangement for table and table; and silver for the tables of silver:
{28:17} And the flesh-hooks, and the vases, and the bowls of pure gold, and for the cups of gold: by weight for cup and cup; and for the cups of silver by weight, for cup and cup.
{28:18} And for the altar of incense of gold purified by weight; and for the pattern of the chariot of the Cherubim; gold for spreading and covering over the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.
{28:19} All in writing from the hand of Jehovah upon me, causing to understand all the works of the pattern.
{28:20} And David will say to Solomon his son, Be strong and be active, and do: thou shalt not fear, and thou shalt not be terrified, for Jehovah God, my God, is with thee; he will not be slack to thee, and he will not forsake thee till the finishing all the works of the service of the house of Jehovah.
{28:21} And behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God: and with thee in all the work for every one willing in wisdom for all the service: and the chiefs and all the people for all thy words.
{29:1} And David the king will say to all the convocation, Solomon my son, God chose in him alone, is a youth and tender, and the work great; for the fortress not for man but for Jehovah God.
{29:2} And with all my power I prepared for the house of my God, gold for gold, and silver for silver, and brass for brass, and iron for iron, woods for woods, and stones of onyx, and the fillings up, and stones of paint and of variegation, and every precious stone, and stones of white marble for multitude.
{29:3} And yet in my delighting in the house of my God, there is to me property of gold and silver I gave to the house of my God, to above from all I prepared for the holy house,
{29:4} Three thousand talents of gold from gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of purified silver, to spread over the walls of the houses:
{29:5} To gold for gold, and to silver for silver, and for all the work by the hand of artificers And who being willing for the filling up of his hand this day to Jehovah?
{29:6} And the chiefs of the fathers will show themselves willing, and the chiefs of the tribes of Israel, and the chiefs of thousands and of hundreds, and for the chiefs of the king's work,
{29:7} And will give for the service of the house of God, gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and silver ten thousand talents, and brass a myriad and eight thousand talents, and iron a hundred thousand talents.
{29:8} And with whom stones being found they gave to the treasure of the house of Jehovah by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
{29:9} And the people will rejoice for their showing themselves willing, for with the whole heart they showed themselves willing to Jehovah: and also David the king rejoiced with great gladness.
{29:10} And David will praise Jehovah before the eyes of all the convocation: and David will say, Praised be thou, O Jehovah God of Israel our father, from forever and even to forever.
{29:11} To thee, O Jehovah, the greatness and the strength, and the glory and the confidence, and the majesty: for all in the heavens and in the earth to thee, O Jehovah, the kingdom and being lifted up to all for head.
{29:12} And riches and honor from before thee, and thou ruling over all, and in thy hand power and strength, and in thy hand to magnify and to strengthen to all.
{29:13} And now, our God, we confess to thee, and praise to the name of thy glory.
{29:14} And because who am I? and who my people, that we shall retain power to show ourselves willing according to this? for from thee all things, and from thy hand they gave to thee.
{29:15} For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers: as a shadow our days upon the earth, and no expectation.
{29:16} O Jehovah our God, all this multitude that we prepared to build to thee a house for thy holy name, it is from thy hand, and to thee the whole.
{29:17} And I knew, my God, that thou triest the heart, and from uprightness thou wilt delight. I in the uprightness of my heart gave willingly all these: and now thy people were found here; I saw with gladness to show themselves willing to thee.
{29:18} O Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaak, and Israel, our fathers, watch this forever to the formation of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare for their heart to thee:
{29:19} And to Solomon my son wilt thou give a whole heart to watch thy commands, thy testimonies, and thy laws, and to do the whole, and to build the fortress which I prepared.
{29:20} And David will say to all the convocation, Praise ye now Jehovah your God. And all the convocation will praise to Jehovah the God of their fathers, and they will bow down and worship to God and the king.
{29:21} And they will sacrifice sacrifices to Jehovah, and they will bring up burnt-offerings to Jehovah for the morrow of that day, a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, and their libations, and sacrifices for abundance for all Israel:
{29:22} And they will eat and drink before Jehovah in that day with great gladness. And they will make the second time for Solomon son of David to be king, and they will anoint him to Jehovah for leader, and to Zadok for priest.
{29:23} And Solomon will sit upon the throne of Jehovah for king instead of David his father, and he will prosper; and all Israel will hear to him.
{29:24} And all the chiefs and the strong ones, and also all the sons of king David gave the hand under Solomon the king.
{29:25} And Jehovah will magnify Solomon to above before the eyes of all Israel, and he will give upon him the majesty of the kingdom which was not upon any king before him over Israel.
{29:26} And David son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
{29:27} And the days which he reigned over Israel were forty years; in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three.
{29:28} And he will die in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son will reign in his stead.
{29:29} And the first and the last words of David the king, behold them written upon the words of Samuel the seer, and upon the words of Nathan the prophet, and upon the words of Gad the seer,
{29:30} With all his kingdom and his strength, and the times which passed over upon him and upon Israel, and upon all the kingdoms of the lands.
