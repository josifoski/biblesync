{1:1} The word of Jehovah which was to Hosea son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, son of Joash, king of Israel.
{1:2} The beginning of the word of Jehovah by Hosea. And Jehovah will say to Hosea, Go, take to thee a wife of fornication and children of fornication; for the land committing fornication, will commit fornication from after Jehovah.
{1:3} And he will go and take Gomer, daughter of Diblaim; and she will conceive and bring forth to him a son.
{1:4} And Jehovah will say to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little and I reviewed the bloods of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and I caused the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.
{1:5} And it was in that day and I broke the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
{1:6} And she will yet conceive and bring forth a daughter. And he will say to him, Call her name, Not being compassionated: for I will no more add to compassionate the house of Israel; for taking away, I will take them away.
{1:7} And I will compassionate the house of Judah, and I saved them by Jehovah their God, and I will not save them by bow and by sword, and by battle, by horses and by horsemen.
{1:8} And she will wean the Not being compassionated, and she will conceive and bring forth a son.
{1:9} And he will say; Call his name, Not my people: for ye are not my people, and I will not be to you.
{1:10} And the number of the sons of Israel was as the sand of the sea which shall not be measured and shall not be numbered: and it was in the place which it shall be said to them, Ye are not my people, and it shall be said to them, Ye the sons of the living God.
{1:11} And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel were gathered together, and they appointed to them one head, and they came up out of the land: for great the day of Jezreel.
{2:1} Say ye to your brethren, My people; and to your sisters, Being compassionated.
{2:2} Contend with your mother, contend ye, for she is not my wife, and I not her husband: for she shall put away her fornications from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;
{2:3} Lest I shall strip her naked, and I set her as the day of her birth, and I set her as a desert, and I set her as a land of dryness, and I slew her with thirst.
{2:4} And her sons I will not compassionate, for they are the sons of fornications.
{2:5} For their mother committed fornication: she conceiving them acted shamefully: for she said, I will go after those loving me giving me my bread and my water, my wool and my linen, mine oil and my drinks.
{2:6} Therefore, behold me hedging in thy way with thorns, and I walled a wall and she shall not find her beaten paths.
{2:7} And she pursued those loving her, and she shall not overtake them; and she sought them and she shall not find: and she said, I will go and turn back to my former husband, for it was well to me then more than now.
{2:8} And she knew not that I gave to her grain, and new wine, and new oil, and I multiplied silver to her, and gold they made for Baal.
{2:9} For this I will turn back and take away my grain in its time, and my new wine in its appointment, and I took away my wool and my linen to cover her nakedness.
{2:10} And now will I uncover her wickedness before the eyes of those loving her, and a man shall not deliver her from my hand.
{2:11} And I caused all her rejoicing to cease, her festival and her new moon, and her Sabbath and all her appointment.
{2:12} And I destroyed her vine and her fig tree, of which she said, They are wages to me which those loving me gave to me: and I set them for a forest, and the beasts of the field ate them.
{2:13} And I reviewed upon her the days of the Baals, which she will burn incense to them, and she will be decked with her earring and her necklace, and she will go after those loving her, and she forget me, says Jehovah.
{2:14} For this, behold, I entice her, and I caused her to go into the desert, and I spake to her heart.
{2:15} And I gave to her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she was humbled there as the days of her youth and as the days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt.
{2:16} And it was in that day, says Jehovah, thou shalt call me, My husband; and thou shalt no more call to me, My Lord.
{2:17} And I put away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.
{2:18} And I cut out for them a covenant in that day with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and the creeping things of the earth: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and I caused them to lie down confidently.
{2:19} And I betrothed thee to me forever; and I betrothed thee to me in justice and in judgment, and in kindness and in compassions.
{2:20} And I betrothed thee to me in faithfulness, and thou knewest Jehovah.
{2:21} And it was in that day, I will answer, says Jehovah, I will answer the heavens and they shall answer the earth;
{2:22} And the earth shall answer the grain and the new wine and the new oil; and they shall answer Jezreel.
{2:23} And I sowed her to me in the earth; and I compassionated her Not being compassionated; and I said to Not my people, Thou my people; and they will say, My God.
{3:1} And Jehovah will say to me, Yet go, love a woman loving evil and an adulteress, as Jehovah loves the sons of Israel, and they took to other gods and love raisin-cakes.
{3:2} And I shall buy her to me for fifteen of silver, and an homer of barley, and a measure of barley:
{3:3} And saying to her, Many days thou shalt well with me; and thou shalt not commit fornication, and thou shalt not be for a man: and also I am for thee.
{3:4} For many days shall the sons of Israel dwell, not a king and not a chief and not a sacrifice and not a pillar and it one ephod and teraphim.
{3:5} Afterward the sons of Israel shall turn back and they sought Jehovah their God, and David their king; and they trembled at Jehovah and at his goodness in the last of the days.
{4:1} Hear the word of Jehovah, ye sons of Israel: for a contention to Jehovah with the inhabitants of the land, for no truth and no kindness and no knowledge of God in the land.
{4:2} Swearing and lying, and breaking in pieces, and stealing and committing adultery, they broke forth; and bloods touched upon bloods.
{4:3} For this the land shall mourn, and every one in it languished with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of the heavens; and also the fish of the sea shall be taken away.
{4:4} But a man shall not contend, and he shall not admonish a man: and my people as contending with the priest.
{4:5} And thou wert weak in the day, and the prophet also was weak with thee by night, and I destroyed thy mother.
{4:6} My people were cut off from not knowing: because thou didst reject knowledge and I will reject thee from being priest to me: and thou wilt forget the instructions of thy God; I will also forget thy sons, also I.
{4:7} As they multiplied so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into dishonor.
{4:8} They will eat up the sin of my people, and they will lift up their soul to their iniquity.
{4:9} And it was as the people so the priest: and I reviewed upon them their way; and their doings I will turn back to them.
{4:10} For they ate and they shall not be satisfied, and they committed fornication and they shall not spread abroad: for with Jehovah they left off to watch.
{4:11} Fornication and wine and new wine will take away the heart.
{4:12} My people will ask in their counsel, and with their rod they will announce to them: for the spirit of fornications caused to err, and they will commit fornication from under their God.
{4:13} Upon the heads of the mountains they will sacrifice, and upon the hills they will burn incense, under the oak and the white poplar and the terebinth, because its shadow was good: for this your daughters will commit fornication, and your brides shall commit adultery.
{4:14} I will not review over your daughters when they shall commit fornication, and over your brides when they shall commit adultery: fur they will separate themselves with harlots, and with prostitutes will they sacrifice: and the people will not understand, they shall be thrown down.
{4:15} If thou Israel commit fornication Judah shall not transgress; and ye shall not come to Gilgal, and ye shall not go up to the house of vanity, and ye shall not swear, Jehovah lives.
{4:16} For as a stubborn heifer Israel was stubborn: now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a wide place.
{4:17} Ephraim is joined to images: leave him.
{4:18} Their drinking bout departed: committing fornication, they committed fornication: they loved, give ye shame upon her shields.
{4:19} The wind bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed of their sacrifices.
{5:1} Hear this ye priests, and attend, ye house of Israel, and give ear, ye house of the king; for the judgment is to you, because ye were a snare to the watch tower and a net stretched out upon Tabor.
{5:2} And the rowers made deep the slaughter, and I a correction to them all.
{5:3} I knew Ephraim and Israel were not hid from me: for now thou didst commit fornication, O Ephraim; Israel was deified.
{5:4} They will not give their doings to turn back to their God, for the spirit of fornication is in the midst of them, and they knew not Jehovah.
{5:5} And the pride of Israel was humbled in his face, and Israel and Ephraim shall be weak in their iniquity; Judah also being weak with them.
{5:6} With their sheep and with their oxen they will go to seek Jehovah; and they shall not find; he withdrew himself from them.
{5:7} Against Jehovah they acted faithlessly: for they begat strange sons: now shall the new moon consume them with their portions.
{5:8} Strike the horn upon the hill, and the trumpet upon the height: make a loud noise at the house of vanity after thee, O Benjamin.
{5:9} Ephraim shall be for desolation in the day of chastisement: in the tribes of Israel I made known the faithful thing.
{5:10} The princes of Judah were as they removing the bound: upon them will I pour out my wrath as water.
{5:11} Ephraim was oppressed, he was broken in judgment because he was willing to go after the command.
{5:12} And I as a moth to Ephraim, and as rottenness to the house of Judah.
{5:13} And Ephraim will see his disease and Judah his wound, and Ephraim will go to Assur, and he will send to king Jareb: and he will not be able to heal for you, and he will not remove from you the wound.
{5:14} For I as the lion to Ephraim, and as the young lion to the house of Judah I, I will rend and go away; I will take away and none delivering.
{5:15} I will go and turn back to my place, even till when they shall be guilty, and they sought my face: in straitness to them they will turn to me.
{6:1} Go ye and we will turn back to Jehovah: for he rent and he will heal us; he will strike, and he will bind us up.
{6:2} He will revive us after two days: in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live before him.
{6:3} And we shall know, we shall pursue to know Jehovah: as the morning his going forth was prepared; and he shall come as the rain to us, as the latter rain, the early rain of the earth.
{6:4} What shall I do to thee, O Ephraim? What shall I do to thee, O Judah? and your kindness as the cloud of the morning, and as the dew being early went away.
{6:5} For this I cut off by the prophets; I slew them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments the light going forth.
{6:6} For I delighted in mercy and not sacrifice; the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.
{6:7} And they as man passed by the covenant: there they acted faithlessly against me.
{6:8} Gilead a city working vanity, defrauding from blood.
{6:9} As troops waiting for a man, the company of priests will break in pieces the way with the shoulder: for they did wickedness.
{6:10} In the house of Israel I saw something horrible: there the fornications to Ephraim, Israel was defiled.
{6:11} Also, O Judah, he set a harvest for thee in my turning back the captivity of my people.
{7:1} As I healed to Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered, and the evils of Shomeron: for they did falsehood, and the thief will come in, and the troop invaded without.
{7:2} And they will not say to their heart, I remembered all their evil: now their doings surrounded them; they were before my face.
{7:3} By their evil they will gladden the king, and the chiefs by their falsehoods.
{7:4} All of them committing adultery, as an oven set on fire from baking; he will cease from raising from kneading the dough till its leavening.
{7:5} The day of our king the chiefs began anger from wine; stretching forth his hand with mockers.
{7:6} For they drew near their heart as a furnace in their lying in wait: all the night their baker slept; in the morning it burnt as the fire of flame.
{7:7} They were all hot as a furnace, and they consumed their judges; all their kings fell: none among them calling to me.
{7:8} Ephraim will mingle himself among my people; Ephraim was a cake not turned.
{7:9} Strangers consumed his strength, and he knew not: also grayness of hair was sprinkled upon him, and he knew not.
{7:10} And the pride of Israel was humbled in his face: and they turned not back to Jehovah their God. And sought him not in all this.
{7:11} And Ephraim will be as an enticed dove, not a heart: they called Egypt, they went to Assur.
{7:12} When they shall go I will spread my net upon them; as birds of the heavens I will bring them down; I will correct them when hearing to their assembly.
{7:13} Wo! to them, for they fled from me: destruction to them because they transgressed against me: and I will redeem them and they spake falsehoods against me.
{7:14} And they cried not to me in their heart, for they shall wail upon their beds: for corn and new wine they will assemble themselves together; they will turn aside against me.
{7:15} And I corrected and strengthened their arms, and they will purpose evil against me.
{7:16} They will turn back not to the Highest: they were as a bow of deceit: their chiefs shall fall by the sword from the wrath of their tongue: this their derision in the land of Egypt.
{8:1} The trumpet to thy mouth: as an eagle upon the house of Jehovah, because they passed by my covenant and they transgressed against my laws.
{8:2} Israel shall cry to me, My God, we knew thee.
{8:3} Israel rejected the good: the enemy shall pursue him.
{8:4} They made kings, and not from me: and they made princes, and I knew not: their silver and their gold they made to them images to cut off.
{8:5} Thy calf rejected, O Shomeron; mine anger was kindled against them: how long shall they not be able to be clean?
{8:6} For from Israel, and this workman made it, and it is not God: for the calf of Shomeron shall be broken in pieces.
{8:7} For they shall sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: no stalk to it: the sprout shall not make flour: perhaps it will make, strangers will swallow it down.
{8:8} Israel was swallowed down: now they were among the nations as a vessel no delight in it.
{8:9} For they went up to Assur, Ephraim a wild ass alone to himself: they hired those loving.
{8:10} Also if they will hire among the nations, now will I gather them, and shall they be weak a little from the lifting up of the king of the princes.
{8:11} Because Ephraim multiplied altars to sin, altars were to him to sin.
{8:12} I will write to him his multitude of my instructions; they were reckoned as a strange thing.
{8:13} The sacrifices of my gifts they will sacrifice flesh, and they will eat; Jehovah delighted not in them; now will he remember their iniquity, and he will review their sins: they shall turn back to Egypt.
{8:14} And Israel will forget him making him, and he will build temples; and Judah multiplied fortified cities: and I sent a fire upon his cities and it will consume its palaces.
{9:1} Thou shalt not rejoice, O Israel; exult not as the peoples: for thou didst commit fornication from thy God; thou didst love a gift upon all the threshing-floors of grain.
{9:2} The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.
{9:3} They shall not dwell in the land of Jehovah; and Ephraim turned back to Egypt, and in Assur they shall eat the unclean thing.
{9:4} They shall not pour out wine to Jehovah, and they shall not be pleasant to him: their sacrifices as the bread of sorrows to them; all eating it shall be defiled: for their bread for their soul shall not come in to the house of Jehovah.
{9:5} What will ye do for the day of appointment, and for the day of the festival of Jehovah?
{9:6} For behold, they went from destruction: Egypt shall gather them together; Memphis shall bury them: the desire for their silver, the prickly weed shall possess them: the thorn in their tents.
{9:7} The days of oversight came, the days of recompense came; Israel knew: the prophet is foolish, the man of the spirit, raving, for the multitude of thine iniquity and great destruction.
{9:8} The watchman of Ephraim with God: the prophet the snare of a fowler upon all his ways; destruction in the house of his God.
{9:9} They made deep, they were corrupted as the days of the hill: he will remember their iniquity, he will review their sins.
{9:10} I found Israel as grapes in the desert; as the first fruit in the fig tree in her beginning I saw your fathers: they went to Baal-Peor, and they will separate themselves to shame, and their abominable things will be according to their love.
{9:11} Ephraim shall fly away as a bird, their glory of birth and of the womb and of conception.
{9:12} But if they shall bring up their sons and I bereaved them from man: but also wo to them in my departing from them.
{9:13} Ephraim, as I saw for Tyre, was planted in a habitation: and Ephraim to bring forth his sons to him slaying.
{9:14} Give to them, O Jehovah: what wilt thou give? give to them a miscarrying womb, and dry breasts.
{9:15} All their wickedness in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the evil of their doings I will drive them out from my house, I will not add to love them: all their chiefs are turning away.
{9:16} Ephraim was smitten, their root was dried up, they shall not make fruit: also if they shall bring forth, and I destroyed the desires of their womb.
{9:17} God will reject them, for they heard not to him: and they will be wandering about among the nations.
{10:1} Israel an empty vine, he will place fruit to himself: according to the multitude to his fruit he multiplied to his altars; according to the goodness of his land they made good pillars.
{10:2} Their heart was divided; now shall they be guilty: he will break down their altars, he shall lay waste their images.
{10:3} For now they will say, No king to us because we feared not Jehovah; and what shall the king do to us?
{10:4} They spake words swearing falsehood, cutting out a covenant: and judgment broke forth as the head upon the furrows of the field.
{10:5} For the calves of the house of vanity they shall fear dwelling in Shomeron: for his people mourned over it, and his priests will exult over it, for its glory, for it was removed from it.
{10:6} Also it shall be brought to Assur a gift to king Jareb: Ephraim shall take shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his counsel.
{10:7} Shomeron, her king was cut off as chiefs upon the face of the waters.
{10:8} And the heights of vanity were destroyed, the sin of Israel: the thorn and weeds shall come up upon their altars; and they said to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall upon us.
{10:9} From the days of the hill thou didst sin, O Israel: there they stood: the battle in the hill against the sons of iniquity shall not overtake them.
{10:10} In my coming and I shall correct them, and the peoples shall be gathered together against them in their being bound to their two sins.
{10:11} And Ephraim a heifer being taught, loving to tread out the grain, and I passed over upon the good of her neck: I will cause Ephraim to ride; Judah shall be silent, and Jacob shall be strong to him.
{10:12} Sow to yourselves for justice, reap ye for the mouth of kindness; break up to you the fallow ground: and the time to seek Jehovah till he shall come and cast justice upon you.
{10:13} Ye ploughed injustice, ye reaped iniquity; ye ate the fruit of falsehood: for thou didst trust in thy way in the multitude of thy strong ones.
{10:14} And an uproar arose among thy people, and all thy fortifications shall be laid waste, as Shaman laid waste the house of the ambush of God in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon the sons.
{10:15} Thus did the house of God to you from the face of the evil of your evil: in the morning the king of Israel being cut off, was cut off.
{11:1} When Israel was a child, and I loved him, and I called for my son out of Egypt.
{11:2} They called to them, thus they went from them: they will sacrifice to the Baals, and to the carved images they will burn incense.
{11:3} And I taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by their arms; and they knew not that I healed them.
{11:4} I will draw them with the cords of man, with the bands of love: and I will be to them as those lifting up the yoke upon their jaw-bones, and I will gently give them to eat.
{11:5} He shall not turn back to the land of Egypt, and Assur shall be his king, for they refused to turn back.
{11:6} And the sword was polished in his cities, and it consumed his branches, and devoured from their counsels.
{11:7} And my people are bent to turning away from me: and they will call together to the Most High; he will not exalt them.
{11:8} How shall I give thee up, O Ephraim? Shall I deliver thee over, O Israel? How shall I give thee as the earth? Shall I set thee as roes? My heart was turned upon me; my grievings were kindled together.
{11:9} I will not do the burning of mine anger, I will not turn back to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not a man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not come into the city.
{11:10} They shall go after Jehovah: as a lion shall he roar: for he shall roar, and the sons of the waters shall tremble.
{11:11} They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assur: and I caused them to dwell in their houses, says Jehovah.
{11:12} Ephraim surrounded me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit: and Judah even ruled with God, and was faithful with the holy ones.
{12:1} Ephraim fed upon the wind, and he pursued the east wind: all the day he multiplied falsehood and destruction; and they will cut out a covenant with Assur, and oil will be brought to Egypt.
{12:2} And a contention to Jehovah with Judah, and to review Jacob according to his ways; he will turn back to him according to his doings.
{12:3} In the belly he circumvented his brother, and by his strength he was a leader with God.
{12:4} And he will be a leader to the messenger, and he will prevail: he wept, and he will make supplication to him: in the house of God he will find him, and there he will speak with him.
{12:5} And Jehovah God of armies, Jehovah his remembrance.
{12:6} And thou, in thy God thou shalt turn back: watch mercy and judgment, and wait always for thy God.
{12:7} Canaan in his hand, the balances of deceit: he loved to oppress.
{12:8} And Ephraim will say, Surely I became rich, I found to me wealth: all my labors shall not be found to me iniquity which was sin.
{12:9} And I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; I will even cause thee to dwell in tents as in the days of the appointment.
{12:10} And I spake by the prophets, and I multiplied the vision, and by the hand of the prophets I will use similitudes.
{12:11} If Gilead nothing? Surely they were vanity: in Gilgal they sacrificed oxen; also their altars as heaps upon the furrows of the field.
{12:12} And Jacob will flee to the field of Aram, and Israel will serve for a wife, and for a wife he watched.
{12:13} And by a prophet Jehovah brought up Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved.
{12:14} Ephraim provoked bitternesses, and bloods shall fly swiftly upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord turn back to him.
{13:1} According to the word Ephraim being terrified be was lifted up in Israel; and he will transgress in Baal and die.
{13:2} And now they will add to sin, and they will make to them a molten image of their silver, in their understanding images the work of artificers all of it: they saying to them, The men sacrificing shall kiss the calves.
{13:3} For this they shall be as the cloud of the morning, and as the early dew going way; as the chaff will be driven from the threshing-floor on the wind, and as the smoke from the chimney.
{13:4} And I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt not know a God except me: and none saving but me.
{13:5} I knew thee in the desert, in the land of thirst.
{13:6} According to their pasture, and they will be satiated; they were satiated, and their heart will be lifted up: for this they forgat me.
{13:7} And I will be to them as a lion: as a panther upon the way I will look around.
{13:8} I will fall upon them as a bear bereaved, and I will rend the enclosure of their heart, and devour them there as a lion: the beast of the field shall cleave them asunder.
{13:9} O Israel, thou didst destroy thyself; but in me in thy help.
{13:10} Now will I be thy king, and he shall save thee in all thy cities, and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Thou shalt give to me a king and princes.
{13:11} I will give to thee a king in mine anger, and I will take away in my wrath.
{13:12} The iniquity of Ephraim was bound up; his sin was concealed.
{13:13} The pains of her bringing forth shall come to him: he a son not wise; for now he shall not stand in the breaking forth of sons.
{13:14} From the hand of hades will I redeem them; from death will I ransom them: I will be thy words, O death, I will be thy cutting off, O hades: consolation will be hid from mine eyes.
{13:15} If he shall bear fruit in the midst of his brethren, the east wind shall come, the wind of Jehovah came up from the desert, and his fountain shall be dried up, and he shall lay waste his place of fountains: he shall plunder the treasure of all vessels of desire.
{13:16} Shomeron shall be guilty, for she rebelled against her God: by the sword shall they fall: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and they having conceived shall be cleft asunder.
{14:1} Turn back, O Israel, even to Jehovah thy God, for thou wert weak in thine iniquity.
{14:2} Take with you words and turn back to Jehovah: say to him, Thou wilt take away all iniquity, and take good: and we will requite the fruits of our lips.
{14:3} Assur will not save us; we will not ride upon a horse, and we will no more say, Our God, to the work of our hands, for in thee the orphan shall be compassionated.
{14:4} I will heal their turning away, I loved them largely: for mine anger turned away from him.
{14:5} I will be as the dew to Israel: he shall blossom as the lily and strike his roots as Lebanon.
{14:6} His sprouts shall go, and his strength shall be as the olive tree, and the odor to him as Lebanon.
{14:7} They sitting in his shadow shall turn back; they shall live upon the grain, and they shall blossom as the vine: his remembrance as the wine of Lebanon.
{14:8} Ephraim: What to me yet to images? I humbled, and I will regard him: I as the green cypress From me thy fruit was found.
{14:9} Who being wise, and he shall understand these things? and knowing, and he shall know them? for the ways of Jehovah are straight, and the just shall go in them: and they transgressing shall be weak in them.
