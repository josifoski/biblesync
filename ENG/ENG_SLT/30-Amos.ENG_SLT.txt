{1:1} The words of Amos who was among the shepherds of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the shaking.
{1:2} And he will say, Jehovah will cry out from Zion, and from Jerusalem he will give his voice; and the habitations of the shepherds mourned, and the head of Carmel was dried up.
{1:3} Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn back for their threshing Gilead with threshing-sledges of iron.
{1:4} And I sent fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of the son of Hadad.
{1:5} And I broke the bar of Damascus, and I cut off the inhabitants of the valleys of vanity, and him taking hold of the rod of the house of delight: and the people of Aram were carried away captive to a walled place said Jehovah.
{1:6} Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn it back, for their carrying away captive the whole captivity to deliver over to Edom.
{1:7} And I sent a fire upon the walls of Gaza, and it shall devour its palaces.
{1:8} And I cut off the inhabitants of Ashdod, and him holding the rod from Ashkelon; and I turned back my hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the rovers perished, said the Lord Jehovah.
{1:9} Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, I will not turn it back, for their delivering over the whole captivity to Edom, and they remembered not the covenant of their brethren:
{1:10} And I sent a fire upon the walls of Tyre and it shall consume her palaces.
{1:11} Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn it back: for his pursuing his brother with the sword, and he destroyed his compassions, and his anger will rend forever, and his wrath was observed perpetually.
{1:12} And I sent a fire upon Teman and it devoured the palaces of Bozrah.
{1:13} Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn it back: for their cleaving asunder those conceiving of Gilead to increase their bound.
{1:14} And I kindled a fire in the walls of Rabbah, and it devoured her palaces with a loud noise in the day of war, with a storm in the day of whirlwind:
{1:15} And their king went into captivity, he and his chiefs together, said Jehovah.
{2:1} Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn it back, for they burnt the bones of the king of Edom into lime:
{2:2} And I will send a fire upon Moab and it devoured the palaces of the cities, and Moab died with tumult, with a loud noise and with the voice of the trumpet:
{2:3} And I cut off the judge from the midst of her, and I will slay all her chiefs with him, said Jehovah.
{2:4} Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn it back from him, for their rejecting the instructions of Jehovah, and they watched not his laws, and their lies caused them to err which their fathers went after them.
{2:5} And I sent a fire upon Judah, and it devoured the palaces of Jerusalem.
{2:6} Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn it back, for their selling the just one for silver and the needy for shoes;
{2:7} Panting for the dust of the earth upon the head of the poor, and they will turn away the way of the humble: and a man and his father will go to the same young girl to profane my holy name:
{2:8} And upon garments taken in pledge they will turn by every altar, and they will drink the wine of the amerced in the house of their God.
{2:9} And I destroyed the Amorite from their face, whom his height as the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; and I will destroy his fruit from above and his roots from beneath.
{2:10} And I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and I will cause you to come into the desert forty years to possess the land of the Amorite.
{2:11} And I will raise up from your sons for prophets, and from your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even this, ye sons of Israel? says Jehovah.
{2:12} And ye will give the Nazarites wine to drink; and ye commanded to the prophets, saying, Ye shall not prophesy.
{2:13} Behold, I am pressed under you as a wagon will be pressed being filled with the sheaf to it.
{2:14} And flight perished from the swift; and the strong shall not strengthen his power, and the mighty shall not save his soul.
{2:15} And he holding the bow shall not stand; and the swift with his feet shall not escape: and he riding the horse shall not save his soul.
{2:16} And he strong of heart among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, says Jehovah.
{3:1} Hear this word which Jehovah spake against you, ye sons of Israel, against all the family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,
{3:2} You only did I know from all the families of the earth: for this I will review over you all your iniquities.
{3:3} Shall two go together if they met not by appointment?
{3:4} Will the lion roar in the forest and not tearing in pieces for him? will the young lion give his voice from his cave if he took nothing?
{3:5} Will the bird fall upon the snare of the earth and no noose for her? shall a snare be brought up from the earth and a taking shall not be taken?
{3:6} If the trumpet shall be struck in the city and the people not be terrified? if evil shall be in the city and Jehovah did not?
{3:7} For the Lord Jehovah will not do a word but he will uncover his secret to his servants the prophets.
{3:8} The lion roared, who shall not be afraid? the Lord Jehovah spake, who shall not prophesy?
{3:9} Cause to be heard upon the palaces in Ashdod, and upon the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Be ye gathered together upon the mountains of Shomeron, and see the great tumults in the midst of her, and the oppressed in the midst of her.
{3:10} And they knew not to do the straight, says Jehovah, storing up violence and oppression in their palaces.
{3:11} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: An adversary and round about the land; and he brought down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces were plundered.
{3:12} Thus said Jehovah: As the shepherd will deliver from the mouth of the lion two legs, and part of an ear, thus shall the sons of Israel be delivered dwelling in Shomeron in the extremity of a tribe, or in Damascus under a roof.
{3:13} Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, says the Lord Jehovah, God of armies.
{3:14} For in the day of my reviewing the transgressions of Israel upon him, and reviewed upon the altars of the house of God: and the horns of the altar were broken, and they fell to the earth.
{3:15} And I struck the house of autumn with the house of summer; and the houses of ivory perished, and the great houses were taken away, says Jehovah.
{4:1} Hear this word, ye heifers of Bashan, which are upon the mountain of Shomeron, oppressing the poor, breaking in pieces the needy, saying to their lords, Bring, and we will drink.
{4:2} The Lord Jehovah sware by his holiness, that behold, the days coming upon you and he took you away with hooks, and your last part with thorns of the fish.
{4:3} And ye shall go forth at the breaches, a woman before her; and ye cast to the fortress, says Jehovah.
{4:4} Come to the house of God and transgress: at Gilgal multiply to transgress; and bring your sacrifices for the morning, your tenths for three days:
{4:5} And burn incense from leaven, a thanksgiving, and call; cause the free will offerings to be heard: for thus ye loved ye sons of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.
{4:6} And also I gave to you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: and ye turned not back even to me, says Jehovah.
{4:7} And I withheld from you the rain in yet three months to harvest: and I caused to rain upon one city, and upon one city I will not cause to rain: and one portion shall be rained upon, and the portion which shall not be rained upon, it shall dry up.
{4:8} And two, three cities wandered about to one city to drink water, and they will not be satisfied: and they turned not back even to me, says Jehovah.
{4:9} I struck you with blasting and with yellowness: the multitudes of your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olives the creeping locust shall eat: and ye turned not back even to me, says Jehovah.
{4:10} And I sent death among you in the way of Egypt: and I slew your young men with the sword, with the captivity of your horses; and I will bring up your camps with fire and in your anger, and ye turned not back even to me, says Jehovah.
{4:11} I overthrew among you as God overthrows Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye shall be as a fire-brand snatched from the burning: and ye turned not back even to me, says Jehovah.
{4:12} For this, thus will I do to thee, O Israel: because that I will do this to thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.
{4:13} For behold, he forming the mountains and creating the wind, and announcing to man his meditation, making the morning darkness and treading upon the heights of the earth, Jehovah, God of armies his name.
{5:1} Hear ye this word which I lift up to you, a lamentation, O house of Israel.
{5:2} The virgin of Israel fell; she shall not add to rise: she was cast out upon her land; none raising her up.
{5:3} For thus said the Lord Jehovah: The city going out a thousand shall leave an hundred, and going out a hundred shall leave ten to the house of Israel.
{5:4} For thus said Jehovah to the house of Israel: Seek ye me and live:
{5:5} And ye shall not seek the house of God, and to Gilgal ye shall not go: and to the well of the oath ye shall not pass over: for Gilgal being taken captive shall be carried away captive, and the house of God shall be for nothing.
{5:6} Seek ye Jehovah and live, lest he shall break through the house of Joseph as fire, and devour, and none quenching to the house of God.
{5:7} Turning judgment to wormwood and they put down justice in the earth.
{5:8} He made the seven stars and Orion, and he turned the shadow of death to the morning, and he darkened the day to night: calling to the water of the sea, and he will pour them out upon the face of the earth: Jehovah his name:
{5:9} Causing desolation to shine forth upon the strong one and desolation shall come against the fortress.
{5:10} They hated him setting right in the gate, and they will abhor the perfect word.
{5:11} For this, because of your treading upon the poor one, and ye will take away the liftings up of wheat from him: ye built houses of hewn stone, and ye shall not dwell in them; ye planted vineyards of desire and ye shall not drink their wine.
{5:12} For I knew your many transgressions, and your strong sins: pressing upon the just, taking a ransom, and they turned away the needy in the gate.
{5:13} For this the prudent one shall be silent in that time, for it is an evil time.
{5:14} Seek good and not evil, so that ye shall live: and so Jehovah God of armies shall be with you as ye said.
{5:15} Hate evil and love good, and set ye judgment in the gate: perhaps Jehovah God of armies will compassionate the remnant of Joseph.
{5:16} For this, thus said Jehovah God of armies, the Lord: In all your broad places, wailing; and in all the streets they shall say, Wo! wo! and they called to the husbandman to mourning, and wailing to all knowing lamentation.
{5:17} And in all vineyards, wailing: for I will pass through in the midst of thee, said Jehovah.
{5:18} Wo! to you longing for the day of Jehovah; for what this to you? The day of Jehovah this is darkness and not light.
{5:19} According as a man will flee from the face of the lion and the bear struck upon him, and he came into the house and leaned his hand upon the wall, and the serpent bit him.
{5:20} Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness and not light? and dark and no shining to it?
{5:21} I hated, I rejected your festivals, and I will not smell in your assemblies.
{5:22} For if ye shall bring up to me burnt-offerings, and your gifts, I will not delight; and I will not look upon the peace-offerings of your fatlings.
{5:23} Remove from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the music of thy lyres.
{5:24} Judgment shall roll as the waters, and justice as a torrent of strength.
{5:25} Did ye bring near to me sacrifices and gifts in the desert forty years, O house of Israel?
{5:26} Ye lifted up the tent of your king and the statue of your images, the star of your God which he made for you.
{5:27} And I caused you to be carried away captive farther off than Damascus, said Jehovah, God of armies his name.
{6:1} Wo! to those living at ease in Zion, and trusting in the mountain of Shomeron, being distinguished the chief of the nations, and to them the house of Israel came.
{6:2} Pass through Calneh, and see; and go ye from thence to Hamath the great: and go down to the wine-press of the rovers: are they good above these kingdoms? or their bound great above your bound?
{6:3} Extending to the evil day, and ye will bring near the seat of violence;
{6:4} Lying upon beds of ivory, and stretching out upon their couches, and eating the lambs from the flock, and the calves from the midst of the stall.
{6:5} Prating upon the mouth of the lyre, as David they invented to them instruments of music;
{6:6} Drinking wine in vases, and they will anoint with the chief of ointments: and they were not grieved for the breaking of Joseph.
{6:7} For this now shall they be carried away captive with the head of those carried away captive, and the shouting a those poured forth was removed.
{6:8} The Lord Jehovah sware by his soul, says Jehovah God of armies: I abhor the pride of Jacob and I hated his palaces: and I delivered up the city and its fulness.
{6:9} And it was if there shall remain ten men in one house, and they died.
{6:10} And his friend lifted him up, and he burning him, and bringing forth the bones out of the house, and he said to him by the sides of the house: Yet with thee? And he said, No more. And he said, Silence: for not to make mention of the name of Jehovah.
{6:11} For behold, Jehovah commands, and he struck the great house with breaches, and the small house with clefts.
{6:12} Shall horses run upon the rock? will he plough with oxen? for ye turned judgment to poison and the fruit of justice to wormwood.
{6:13} Rejoicing to no word, saying, Did we not take horns by our strength?
{6:14} For behold, I raise up against you, O house of Israel, says Jehovah God of armies, a nation; and they pressed you from the entrance of Hamath, even to the torrent of the sterile region.
{7:1} Thus the Lord Jehovah caused me to see; and behold, he will form locusts in the beginning of the coming up of the latter grass; and behold, the latter grass after the moorings of the king.
{7:2} And it was if he finished to devour the green herb of the land, and saying, O Lord Jehovah, forgive now: who shall raise up Jacob? for he is small.
{7:3} Jehovah lamented for this: It shall not be, said Jehovah.
{7:4} Thus the Lord Jehovah caused me to see: and behold, the Lord Jehovah called to contend with fire, and it will devour the great deep, and devoured the portion.
{7:5} And saying, O Lord Jehovah, cease now: who shall cause Jacob to rise? for he is small.
{7:6} Jehovah lamented for this: Also this shall not be, said the Lord Jehovah.
{7:7} Thus he caused me to see: and behold, Jehovah stood upon a wall of lead, and lead in his hand.
{7:8} And Jehovah will say to me, What seest thou, Amos? And saying, Lead. And Jehovah will say to me: Behold me setting lead in the midst of my people Israel: I will no more add to pass by to him.
{7:9} And the heights of Isaak were made desolate, and the holy places of Israel shall be laid waste; and I rose up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
{7:10} And Amaziah priest of the house of God, will send to Jeroboam, kind of Israel, saying, Amos conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land will not be able to endure all his words.
{7:11} For thus said Amos: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel being taken captive shall be carried away captive from his land.
{7:12} And Amaziah will say to Amos, Thou seer, go flee for thyself to the land of Judah, and eat there bread, and there shalt thou prophesy.
{7:13} And thou shalt no more add to prophesy in the house of God, for it is the king's holy place, and it is the house of the kingdom.
{7:14} And Amos will answer and say to Amaziah, I am no prophet, and I not the son of a prophet; for I a herdsman, and gathering figs of the sycamores.
{7:15} And Jehovah will take me from after the sheep, and Jehovah will say to me, Go prophesy to my people Israel.
{7:16} And now hear the word of Jehovah: Thou sayest thou shalt not prophesy against Israel, and thou shalt not drop against the house of Isaak.
{7:17} For this, thus said Jehovah: Thy wife shall commit fornication in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line, and thou shalt die upon a polluted land: and Israel being taken captive shall be carried into captivity from his land.
{8:1} Thus the Lord Jehovah caused me to see: and behold, a basket of fruit.
{8:2} And he will say, Amos, what seest thou? And saying, A basket of fruit. And Jehovah will say to me: The end came upon my people Israel; I will no more add to pass by to him.
{8:3} The songs of the temple wailed in that day, says the Lord Jehovah; many a corpse in every place being cast forth: silence.
{8:4} Hear this, ye, panting after the needy, to cause the humble of the, land to cease.
{8:5} Saying, When will the month pass through, and we will sell grain? and the Sabbath, and we will open wheat to diminish the ephah, and to enlarge the shekel, and to make crooked the balance of deceit?
{8:6} To buy the poor with silver, and the needy for shoes; and we will sell the refuse of the grain.
{8:7} Jehovah sware by the pride of Jacob, If I will forget forever all their works.
{8:8} For this shall not the land be moved, and all dwelling in it, mourn? And it came up all of it as a river; and it was driven out and watered as the river of Egypt.
{8:9} And it was in that day, says the Lord Jehovah, I caused the sun to set at noon, and I darkened the light to the earth in that day:
{8:10} And turned your festivals into mourning, and all your songs to lamentation; and I brought up sackcloth upon all loins, and upon every head, baldness; and I set it as the mourning of an only one, and its last part as a day of bitterness.
{8:11} Behold, the days coming, says the Lord Jehovah, and I sent famine into the land; not a famine for bread, and not a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of Jehovah.
{8:12} And they wandered from sea even to sea, and from the north and even to the sunrising, they shall run up and down to seek the word of Jehovah and they shall not find.
{8:13} In that day the fair virgins shall faint, and the young men, for thirst.
{8:14} They swearing by the trespass of Shomeron, and they said, Thy God lives, O Dan, and the way of the well of the oath lives, and they fell, and they shall rise no more.
{9:1} I saw Jehovah standing upon the altar: and he will say, Strike the crown, and the thresholds shall tremble: and dash them in pieces upon the head of them all; and the last of them I will slay with the sword: the fleeing to them shall not flee, and he escaping to them shall not escape.
{9:2} If they shall break through into hades, from thence shall my hand take them; and if they shall go up to the heavens, from thence I will bring them down.
{9:3} And if they shall hide in the head of Carmel, from thence will I search and take them; and if they shall be concealed from before mine eyes in the bottom of the sea, from thence I will command the serpent, and he bit them.
{9:4} If they shall go into captivity before the face of their enemies, from thence I will command the sword and it slew them: and I set mine eyes upon them for evil and not for good.
{9:5} And the Lord Jehovah of armies touching upon the land, and it shall melt, and all dwelling in it mourned: and it came up as a river all of it, and it was overflowed as the river of Egypt.
{9:6} He building his ascents in the heavens, and founding his arches upon the earth; he calling to the waters of the sea, and he will pour them forth upon the face of the earth: Jehovah his name.
{9:7} Are ye not as the sons of the Cushites to me, O sons of Israel? says Jehovah. Did I not bring up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the rovers from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir?
{9:8} Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah upon the sinning kingdom, and I destroyed it from the face of the earth; only that destroying, I will not destroy the house of Jacob, says Jehovah.
{9:9} For behold, I command, and I caused the house of Israel to move to and fro among all nations as it will move to and fro in a sieve, and a stone shall not fall to the earth.
{9:10} By the sword shall all sinning of my people die, saying, It shall not draw near, and the evil shall not cleave about us.
{9:11} In that day I will raise up the tent of David having fallen, and I walled in their breaches, and I will raise up its destructions, and I built it as the days of old:
{9:12} So that they shall possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations which my name was called upon them, says Jehovah doing this.
{9:13} Behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, the ploughing touched upon the harvesting, and the treading of grapes upon the drawing of the seed; and the mountains dropped new wine, and all the hills shall melt.
{9:14} And I turned back the captivity of my people Israel, and they built the cities laid waste, and they inhabited; and they planted vineyards, and they drank their wine; and they made gardens and ate their fruit.
{9:15} And I planted them upon their land, and they shall no more be plucked up from their land which I gave to them, said Jehovah thy God.
