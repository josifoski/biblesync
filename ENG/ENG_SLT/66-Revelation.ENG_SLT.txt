{1:1} The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants what things must be with speed; and he signified having sent by his angel to his servant John:
{1:2} Who bare witness to the word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, as much as he saw.
{1:3} Happy he reading, and they hearing the words of the prophecy, and keeping the things written in it, for the time is near.
{1:4} John to the seven churches which in Asia: Grace to you, and peace, from him who being, and who was, and who coming; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne.
{1:5} And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first born from the dead, and the chief of the kings of the earth. To him having loved us, and washed us from our sins in his blood,
{1:6} And he made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him the glory and strength for the times of times.
{1:7} Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they who goaded him: and all the tribes of the earth shall lament on account of him. Yes, Amen.
{1:8} I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, says the Lord, who being, and who was, and who coming, the Omnipotent Ruler.
{1:9} I John, and your brother, and partaker in pressure, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, I was in the island called Patmos, for the sake of the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
{1:10} I was in the Spirit In the day pertaining to the Lord, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, saying,
{1:11} I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send to the seven churches which in Asia; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.
{1:12} And I turned back to see the voice which spake with me. And having turned back, I saw seven gold chandeliers;
{1:13} And in the midst of the seven chandeliers one like to the Son of man, dressed in a garment descending to the feet, and girded at the breast with a golden girdle.
{1:14} And his head and hairs white as white wool, as snow, and his eyes as a flame of fire;
{1:15} And his feet as brass of Lebanon, as refined by fire in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters.
{1:16} And having in his right hand seven stars: and going out of his mouth a sharp two-mouthed sword: and his sight as the sun shines in his power.
{1:17} And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he put his right hand upon me, saying to me, Be not afraid; I am the first and the last:
{1:18} And he living, and I was dead; and, behold, I am living for the times of times, Amen; and have the keys of hades and of death.
{1:19} Write the things thou hast seen, and which are, and which are about to be after these things;
{1:20} The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest upon my right hand, and the seven golden chandeliers. The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches: and the seven chandeliers which thou sawest are the seven churches.
{2:1} To the messenger of the Ephesian church write: Thus says he holding the seven stars in his right hand, he walking about in the midst of the seven golden chandeliers;
{2:2} I know thy works, and thy fatigue, and thy patience, and that thou canst not bear the wicked: and thou hast tried them saying they are sent, and are not, and thou Last found them liars:
{2:3} And thou hast borne, and thou hast patience, and for my name hast thou been wearied, and thou hast not been broken by toil.
{2:4} But I have against thee, for thou hast let go thy first love.
{2:5} Therefore remember whence thou hast fallen, and repent, and do the first works; and if not, I come to thee quickly, and I will move the chandelier out of its place, except thou repent.
{2:6} But this hast thou, that thou dost hate the works of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.
{2:7} He having ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches; To him conquering I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the pleasure garden of God.
{2:8} And to the messenger of the church of the Smyrnians write; Thus says the first and the last, who was dead and he lived;
{2:9} I know thy works, and pressure, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and the blasphemy of them saying themselves to be Jews, and are not, but the synagogue of the adversary.
{2:10} Neither be afraid of what things thou art about to suffer: behold, the accuser is about to cast of you into prison, that ye might be tried; and ye shall have pressure ten days: be thou faithful until death, and I will give thee the crown of life.
{2:11} He having ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches; He conquering should not be injured by the second death.
{2:12} And to the messenger to the calling out in Pergamos write: Thus says he having the sharp two-mouthed sword;
{2:13} I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, where the throne of Satan: and thou holdest my name, and hast not denied my faith, and in the days in which Antipas my faithful witness, who was slain with you, where Satan dwells.
{2:14} But I have a few things against thee, for thou hast there them holding the teaching of Balsam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.
{2:15} So also hast thou them holding the teaching of the Nicolaitanes, which I hate.
{2:16} Repent; and if not, I come to thee swiftly, and will wage war with them with the sword of my mouth.
{2:17} He having ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches; To him conquering will I give to eat from the hidden manna, and I will give him a white small stone, and upon the small stone a new name written, which none knew except he receiving.
{2:18} And to the messenger of the church among the Thyatirians write; Thus says the Son of God, having his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet like the brass of Lebanon;
{2:19} I know thy works, and love, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last more than the first.
{2:20} But I have a few things against thee, for thou sufferest the woman Jezebel, calling herself a prophetess, to teach and to lead my servants astray to commit fornication, and to eat things offered to idols.
{2:21} And I gave her time that she might repent of her fornication; and she repented not.
{2:22} Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them committing adultery with her into great pressure, except they repent of their works.
{2:23} And her children will I kill in death; and all the churches shall know that I am he searching the reins and hearts: and I will give to you each according to our works.
{2:24} And say to you, and to the rest among the Thyatirians, as many as have not this teaching, and who know not the burden of Satan, as they say; I will cast no other burden upon you.
{2:25} But what ye have, hold ye until I come.
{2:26} And he conquering, and keeping my works till the end, I will give him power over the nations:
{2:27} And he will rule them with an iron rod; as vessels of earthen-ware shall they be rubbed together: as I also have received of my Father.
{2:28} And I will give him the morning star.
{2:29} He having ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
{3:1} And to the messenger of the church in Sardis write: Thus says he having the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead:
{3:2} Be watching, and make firm the remaining things, which are about to die: For I have not found thy works perfected before God.
{3:3} Remember therefore how thou hast received, and heard, and do thou, and repent. If therefore thou watch not, I will come upon thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I shall come upon thee.
{3:4} Thou hast a few names also in Sardis which stained not their garments; and they shall walk about with me in white things: for they are worthy.
{3:5} He conquering, the same shall be surrounded in white garments; and I will not wipe out his name from the book of life, but I will acknowledge his name before my Father, and before his messengers.
{3:6} He having ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
{3:7} And to the messenger of the church in Philadelphia write; Thus says the holy, the true, he having the key of David, he opening, and no one shuts; and he shuts, and no one opens;
{3:8} I know thy works: behold, I have given before thee an open door, and none can shut it, for thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.
{3:9} Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, of them saying themselves to be Jews, and are not, but they lie; behold, I will make them that they come and worship before thy feet, and they should know that I have loved thee.
{3:10} For thou didst keep the word of my patience, and I will keep thee from the hour of temptation, about to come upon the whole habitable globe, to try them dwelling upon the earth.
{3:11} Behold, I come swiftly: hold what thou hast, that none take thy crown.
{3:12} He conquering, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and without shall he no more come forth: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from heaven from my God: and my new name.
{3:13} He having ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
{3:14} And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; Thus says the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;
{3:15} I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor boiling: I would thou shouldest be cold or boiling.
{3:16} For so thou art tepid, and neither cold nor boiling, I am about to vomit thee out of my month.
{3:17} For thou sayest, That I am rich, and have abounded, and have need of nothing; and thou knowest not that thou art wretched, and pitiable, and poor, and blind, and naked;
{3:18} I counsel thee to buy gold of me refined by fire, that thou mightest be rich; and white garments, that thou mightest be surrounded, and that the shame of thy nakedness might not be made manifest; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mightest see.
{3:19} I, if as many as I love, I rebuke and correct: be emulous therefore, and repent.
{3:20} Behold, I stand before the door, and knock: and if any hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
{3:21} He conquering, will I give to him to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered, and sat down with my Father on his throne.
{3:22} He having ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
{4:1} After these things I saw, and, behold, a door opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard as of a trumpet speaking with me; saying, Come up here, and I will show thee what things must be after these.
{4:2} And instantly I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne.
{4:3} And he sitting was like the vision to a jasper stone and a sardine; and a rainbow round about the throne, like the vision to an emerald.
{4:4} And round about the throne twenty-four thrones; and sitting upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders, surrounded with white garments; and they had golden crowns upon their heads.
{4:5} And from the throne go forth lightnings, and thunders, and voices: and seven torches of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
{4:6} And before the throne a sea of glass like crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.
{4:7} And the first living creature like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature having the face as a man, and the fourth living creature like a spreading eagle.
{4:8} And the four living creatures, one by itself, had six wings together round about; and within full of eyes; and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, who was, and who being, and who coming.
{4:9} And when the living creatures shall give glory and honour and thanks to him sitting on the throne, and to him living forever and ever,
{4:10} The twenty-four elders will fall before him sitting on the throne, and will worship him living forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
{4:11} Worthy art thou, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power; for thou didst create all things, and by thy will they are, and they were created.
{5:1} And I saw upon the right hand of him sitting upon the throne, a book written within and behind, sealed with seven seals.
{5:2} And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose its seals?
{5:3} And none was able in heaven, nor upon earth, nor under the earth, to open the book, nor to look upon it.
{5:4} And I wept much, that none was found worthy to open and to read the hook, neither to look upon it.
{5:5} And one of the elders says to me, Weep not: behold, the Lion conquered, he being of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, to open the book, and to loose its seven seals.
{5:6} And I saw, and, behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent into all the earth.
{5:7} And he came and took the book from the right hand of him sitting upon the throne.
{5:8} And when he took the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, having each harps, and golden bowls full of incenses, which are the prayers of the holy.
{5:9} And they sing a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open its seals: for thou wert slain, and didst purchase us to God by thy blood from every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation;
{5:10} And madest us kings and priests to our God: and we shall reign upon the earth.
{5:11} And I saw, and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders: and their number was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands;
{5:12} Saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and praise.
{5:13} And every creature which is in heaven, and in earth, and under the earth, and upon the sea, which are, and all things in them, heard I saying, To him sitting upon the throne, and to the Lamb, praise, and honour, and glory, and strength, for the times of times.
{5:14} And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the twenty-four elders fell and worshipped him living for the times of times.
{6:1} And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as the voice of thunder, Come and see.
{6:2} And I saw and behold a white horse: and he sitting upon him having a bow; and a crown was given to him: and he went forth conquering, and that he might conquer.
{6:3} And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come and see.
{6:4} And another horse came forth fiery red: and it was given to him sitting upon him to take peace from the earth, and that they should slaughter one another: and a great sword was given to him.
{6:5} And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold a black horse, and he sitting upon him having a balance in his hand.
{6:6} And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for a drachma, and three measures of barley for a drachma; and thou shouldest not injure the oil and the wine.
{6:7} And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard a voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come and see.
{6:8} And I saw, and behold a pale horse: and he sitting above him the name to him Death, and Hades follows with him. And power was given to them to kill upon the fourth of the earth, with sword, and by famine, and by death, and by wild beasts of the earth.
{6:9} And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of the slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they had:
{6:10} And they cried with a great voice, saying, Till when, Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood of them dwelling upon earth
{6:11} And to each were given white robes; and it was said to them, that they should rest for a little time, till also their fellowservants be filled up, about to be killed, as also they.
{6:12} And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and, behold, there was a great shaking; and the sun was black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon was as blood;
{6:13} And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts her untimely figs, shaken by a great wind.
{6:14} And the heaven was separated as a book turned round; and every mount and isle were moved from their places.
{6:15} And the kings of the earth, and the great, and the rich, and the captains of thousands, and the powerful, and every servant, and every one free, hid themselves in caves and in rocks of the mountains;
{6:16} And they say to the mountains and rocks, Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of him sitting upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
{6:17} For the great day of his wrath has come; and who can stand?
{7:1} And after these things I saw four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind blow not upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree.
{7:2} And I saw another angel having come from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a great voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to injure the earth and the sea,
{7:3} Saying, Injure not the earth, neither the sea, neither the trees, until we should seal the servants of God upon their foreheads.
{7:4} And I heard the number of the sealed: an hundred and forty-four thousand sealed of all the tribes of the sons of Israel.
{7:5} Of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand sealed.
{7:6} Of the tribe of Aser twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Nepthalim twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Manasses twelve thousand sealed.
{7:7} Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand sealed.
{7:8} Of the tribe of Zabulon twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand sealed.
{7:9} After these things I saw, and, behold, a great multitude, which none could number it, of all nations, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, having put round white robes, and palm trees in their hands;
{7:10} And crying with a great voice, saying, Salvation to our God sitting upon the throne, and to the Lamb.
{7:11} And all the angels stood round about the throne, and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell before the throne upon their faces, and worshipped God,
{7:12} Saying, Amen: praise, and glory, and wisdom, and gratitude, and honour, and power, and strength, to our God for ever and ever. Amen.
{7:13} And one of the elders answered, saying to me, These having put round white robes, who are they? and whence came they.
{7:14} And I said to him, Lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they coming out of great pressure, and they washed their robes, and whitened their robes in the blood of the Lamb.
{7:15} Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he sitting upon the throne will dwell among them.
{7:16} They shall hunger no more, nor thirst any more; nor should the sun fall upon them, neither any heat.
{7:17} For the Lamb in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall guide them to living fountains of water: and God shall wipe out every tear from their eyes.
{8:1} And when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about half an hour.
{8:2} And I saw the seven angels who stood before God; and seven trumpets were given to them.
{8:3} And another angel came and was placed by the altar, having a golden censer; and many perfumes were given him, that he might give to the prayers of the holy upon the golden altar before the throne.
{8:4} And the smoke of the perfumes went up, with the prayers of the holy, from the angel's hand before God.
{8:5} And the angel took the censer, and filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast into the earth: and there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
{8:6} And the seven angels having the seven trumpets prepared themselves that they might sound the trumpets.
{8:7} And the first angel sounded the trumpet, and there were hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was cast into the earth: and a third of the trees were burned down, and all green grass was burned down.
{8:8} And the second angel sounded the trumpet, and as a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third of the sea was blood;
{8:9} And the third of the creatures which in the sea, died, those having souls; and the third of the ships were destroyed.
{8:10} And the third angel sounded the trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, burning as a torch, and it fell upon a third of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;
{8:11} And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third of the waters is into wormwood; and many of men died of the waters, for they were rendered bitter.
{8:12} And the fourth angel sounded the trumpet, and the third of the sun was stricken, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars; that a third of them might be darkened, and the day shone not, a third of it, and the night likewise.
{8:13} And I saw, and heard one angel flying in the midst of heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, to them dwelling upon earth from the rest of the voices of the trumpet of the three angels, about to sound the trumpet!
{9:1} And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven to the earth: and there was given to him the key of the well of the bottomless pit.
{9:2} And he opened the well of the bottomless pit; and a smoke went up out of the well, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun was darkened, and the air, from the smoke of the well.
{9:3} And out of the smoke came forth locusts into the earth: and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
{9:4} And it was said to them that they should not injure the grass of the earth, neither any green, nor any tree; except the men only which have not the seal of God upon their foreheads.
{9:5} And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tortured five months: and their torture as the torture of a scorpion, when he should strike a man.
{9:6} And in those days shall men seek death, and not find it; and shall eagerly desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
{9:7} And the likenesses of the locusts like horses prepared for war; and upon their heads as crowns like gold, and their faces as men's faces.
{9:8} And they had hair as women's hair, and their teeth were as of lions.
{9:9} And they had coats of mail, as coats of mail of iron; and the voice of their wings as the voice of chariots of many horses running to war.
{9:10} And they have tails as scorpions, and goads were in their tails: and their power to injure men five months.
{9:11} And they have a king over them, the angel of the abyss, the name to him in Hebrew Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.
{9:12} One woe has passed; behold, there come two woes more after these.
{9:13} And the sixth angel sounded the trumpet, and I heard one voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,
{9:14} Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels bound in the great river Euphrates.
{9:15} And the four angels were loosed, prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, that they might kill the third of men.
{9:16} And the number of troops of cavalry, two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard their number.
{9:17} And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them sitting upon them, having fiery coats of mail, and of deep purple, and sulphurous: and the horses' heads as lions' heads; and out of their mouths went forth fire and smoke and sulphur.
{9:18} By these three were the third of men killed, from fire, and from smoke, and from brimstone, coming forth out of their mouths.
{9:19} For their powers are in their month, and in their tails: for their tails like serpents, having heads, and with them they injure.
{9:20} And the rest of men who were not killed by these blows, neither repented of the works of their hands, that they should not worship evil spirits, and images of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and wood: which neither can see, neither hear, neither walk:
{9:21} And they repented not of their slaughters, nor of their charms, nor of their fornications, nor of their thefts.
{10:1} And I saw another strong angel coming down from heaven, surrounded with a cloud: and a rainbow upon the head, and his face as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
{10:2} And he had in his hand a small book opened: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the earth,
{10:3} And he cried with a great voice, as a lion roars: and when he cried, the seven thunders spake their voices.
{10:4} And when the seven thunders spake their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Seal what the seven thunders spake, and thou mayest not write these.
{10:5} And the angel which I saw standing upon the sea and upon earth lifted up his hand to heaven,
{10:6} And sware by him living for ever and ever, who created the heaven, and all in it, and earth, and all things in it, and the sea, and all in it, that time shall be no more:
{10:7} But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he should be about to sound the trumpet, and the mystery of God should be finished, as he announced the good news to his servants the prophets.
{10:8} And the voice which I heard from heaven again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the little book opened in the hand of the angel having stood upon the sea and upon the earth.
{10:9} And I came forth to the angel, saying to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me, Take, and eat it up; and it shall render thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth shall it be sweet as honey.
{10:10} And I took the small book from the angel's hand, and I was eating it; and in my mouth was as honey, sweet: and when I ate it, my belly was bitter.
{10:11} And he says to me, Thou must again prophesy to peoples, and nations, and tongues, and many kings.
{11:1} And a reed was given me like rod: and the messenger stood, saying, Arise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them worshipping in it.
{11:2} And the court-yard that without the temple throw out, and thou mayest not measure it: for it was given to the nations: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty-two months.
{11:3} And I will give to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, surrounded with sackcloth.
{11:4} These are the two olive trees, and the two chandeliers which having stood before the God of the earth.
{11:5} And if any would injure them, fire goes forth out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any would injure them, so must he be put to death.
{11:6} These have power to shut up heaven, that the rain should not wet in the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with every blow, as often as they wish.
{11:7} And when they should finish their testimony, the wild beast coming up out of the abyss shall wage war with them, and shall conquer them, and kill them.
{11:8} And their slain bodies upon the spacious way of the great city, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
{11:9} And they from the people and tongues and nations shall see their slain bodies three days and a half, and they shall not suffer their slain bodies to be put into tombs.
{11:10} And they dwelling upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and shall be gladdened, and shall send gifts to one another; for these two prophets tortured them dwelling upon the earth.
{11:11} And after three days and a half the Spirit of life from God came upon them, and they stood upon their feet: and great fear fell upon those beholding them.
{11:12} And they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they went up to heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them.
{11:13} And in that hour was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell, and there were slain in the shaking seven thousand names of men: and the rest were terrified, and they gave glory to the God of heaven.
{11:14} The second woe passed away; behold, the third woe comes swiftly.
{11:15} And the seventh angel sounded the trumpet; and great voices were in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world were our Lord's, and his Christ's; and he shall reign for ever and ever.
{11:16} And the twenty four elders, which before God sitting upon their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,
{11:17} Saying, We return thanks to thee, O Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, who being, and who was, and who coming; for thou hast taken thy great power, and reigned.
{11:18} And the nations were angry, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead, to be judged, and to give reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the holy, and to them fearing thy name, the small and great; and to destroy them destroying the earth.
{11:19} And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and shakings, and great hail.
{12:1} And a great sign was seen in heaven; a woman surrounded by the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:
{12:2} And having in the womb she cries, having the pains of childbirth, and making trial to bring forth.
{12:3} And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold a great fiery red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems.
{12:4} And his tail draws the third of the stars of heaven, and he cast them into the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman about to bring forth, that when she should bring forth he might devour her child.
{12:5} And she brought forth a son, a male, who is about to rule all nations with an iron rod: and her child was snatched up to God, and his throne.
{12:6} And the woman fled into the desert where she has a place prepared from God, that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.
{12:7} And war was in heaven; and Michael and his angels waged war against the dragon; and the dragon waged war and his angels,
{12:8} And were not strong; nor was place more found for them in heaven.
{12:9} And the great dragon was cast out, the old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, he deceiving the whole habitable globe: he was cast into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
{12:10} And I heard a great voice saying in heaven, Now was salvation and power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren was cast down, he accusing them before our God, day and night.
{12:11} And they conquered him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their souls till death.
{12:12} For this rejoice, ye heavens, and they dwelling in them. Woe to them inhabiting the earth and the sea! for the devil came down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has little time.
{12:13} And when the dragon saw that he was cast into the earth, he drove out the woman who brought forth the male.
{12:14} And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly to the desert, to her place, where she is nourished there a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
{12:15} And the serpent cast after the woman water out of his mouth as a river, that he might make her torn away by a river.
{12:16} And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed down the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
{12:17} And the dragon was angry at the woman, and went out to make war with the rest of her seed, those keeping the commands of God, and having the testimony of Jesus Christ.
{13:1} And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and I saw coming up from the sea a wild beast, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.
{13:2} And the wild beast which I saw was like a panther, and his feet as of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.
{13:3} And I saw one of his heads as slaughtered to death; and his deathblow was healed: and the whole earth wondered after the beast.
{13:4} And they worshipped the dragon which gave power to the wild beast: and they worshipped the wild beast, saying, Who like the beast? who shall be able to war with him.
{13:5} And a mouth was given him speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given him to make war forty-two months.
{13:6} And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tent, and them dwelling in heaven.
{13:7} And it was given him to make war with the holy, and to conquer them: and power was given him over every tribe, and tongue, and nation.
{13:8} And all they dwelling upon earth shall worship him, whose names have not been written in the book of life of the slain Lamb from the foundation of the world.
{13:9} If any have an ear, let him hear.
{13:10} If any bring together to captivity he shall proceed into captivity: if any shall kill with sword, he shall be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and faith of the holy.
{13:11} And I saw another wild beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
{13:12} And all the powers of the first beast he does before him, and he makes the earth and all dwelling in it that they should worship the first wild beast, whose death-blow was healed.
{13:13} And he does great signs, that also he might make fire come down from heaven to the earth before men,
{13:14} And he deceives them dwelling upon earth by the signs which were given him to do before the wild beast; saying to them dwelling upon earth, to make an image to the wild beast, who has the blow of the sword, and he lived.
{13:15} And it was given him to give spirit to the image of the wild beast, that the image of the wild beast might speak, and might make as many as should not worship the image of the wild beast that they be killed.
{13:16} And he makes all, small and great, and rich and poor, and free and servants, that he should give them a stamp upon their right hand, or upon their foreheads:
{13:17} And that no one could buy or sell, except he having the stamp, or the name of the wild beast, or the number of his name.
{13:18} Here is wisdom. Let him having intelligence calculate the number of the wild beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number Six hundred and sixty-six.
{14:1} And I saw, and, behold, a Lamb standing upon mount Sion, and with him a hundred forty-four thousand, having the name of his Father written in their foreheads.
{14:2} And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of great thunder: and I heard the voice of harp players playing on their harps:
{14:3} And they sing as a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders: and none could learn the song, except the hundred forty-four thousand, purchased from the earth.
{14:4} There are they who were not contaminated by women; for they are virgins. These are they following the Lamb wherever he should lead. These were purchased from men, first fruits to God and the Lamb.
{14:5} And guile was not found in their mouth: for they are blameless before the throne of God.
{14:6} And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the lasting good news to announce to them dwelling upon the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people,
{14:7} Saying with a great voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment has come: and worship ye him having made the heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
{14:8} And another angel followed, saying, She fell, Babylon fell, the great city, for all nations has she given to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
{14:9} And the third angel followed them, saying with a great voice, If any worship the wild beast and his image, and receive the stamp upon his forehead, or upon his hand,
{14:10} And the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, mingled pure in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tortured in fire and sulphur before the holy angels, and before the Lamb:
{14:11} And the smoke of their torture goes up forever and ever: and they have no rest day and night, those worshipping the wild beast and his image, and if any receive the stamp of his name.
{14:12} Here is the patience of the holy: here they keeping the commands of God, and the faith of Jesus.
{14:13} And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, Write, Happy the dead who dying in the Lord from henceforth: Yes, says the Spirit, that they might cease from their fatigues; and their works follow with them.
{14:14} And I saw, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud he sitting like the Son of man, having upon his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
{14:15} And another angel went forth out of the temple, crying with a great voice to him sitting upon the cloud, Send thy sickle, and reap: for the hour has come to thee to reap; for the earth's harvest was dried up.
{14:16} And he sitting upon the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.
{14:17} And another angel came forth out of the temple which in heaven, the same also having a sharp sickle.
{14:18} And another angel came forth from the altar, having power over fire; and he called with a great cry to him having the sharp sickle, saying, Send thy sharp sickle, and harvest the grapes of the vineyard of the earth; for her grapes were fully ripe.
{14:19} And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and harvested the earth's vineyard, and cast into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
{14:20} And the winepress was trodden under foot without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even to the horses' bridles, from sixteen hundred stadia.
{15:1} And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels having the seven last blows; for in them was the wrath of God finished.
{15:2} And I saw as a sea made of glass mingled with fire: and they conquering from the wild beast, and from his image, and from his stamp, and from the number of his name, standing upon the sea made of glass, having harps of God.
{15:3} And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful thy works, O Lord God, Omnipotent Ruler; just and true thy ways, King of the holy.
{15:4} Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou alone holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy justices were made manifest.
{15:5} And after these things I saw, and behold, the temple of the tent of testimony was opened in heaven:
{15:6} And the seven angels came forth out of the temple, having the seven blows, clothed in linen, pure and shining, and being girded about the breasts with golden girdles.
{15:7} And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, living forever and ever.
{15:8} And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and none could come into the temple, till the seven blows of the seven angels were finished.
{16:1} And I heard a great voice out of the temple saving to the seven angels, Go forward, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God in the earth.
{16:2} And the first went forth, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and a bad and evil sore was upon the men having the stamp of the wild beast, and them worshipping his image.
{16:3} And the second angel poured out his vial into the sea; and it was blood as of a dead body: and every living soul died in the sea.
{16:4} And the third angel poured out his vial into the rivers, and into the fountains of waters; and it was blood.
{16:5} And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Just, O Lord, art thou, who being, and who was, and who wilt be, for thou didst judge these things.
{16:6} For they poured out the blood of the holy, and of the prophets, and thou didst give them blood to drink i for they are worthy.
{16:7} And I heard another from the altar saying, Yes, O Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, true and just thy judgments.
{16:8} And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and it was given him to parch up men with fire.
{16:9} And men were parched up with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God, having power over these blows: and they repented not to give him glory.
{16:10} And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the throne of the wild beast; and his kingdom was darkened; and they pressed their tongues for pain,
{16:11} And they blasphemed the God of heaven for their pains and for their sores, and they repented not of their work.
{16:12} And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that the way of the kings of the risings of the sun might be prepared.
{16:13} And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the wild beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs.
{16:14} For they are the spirits of demons, doing signs, to go out upon all the kings of the earth and of the whole habitable globe, to gather them together for the war of that great day of God, the Omnipotent Ruler.
{16:15} (Behold, I come as a thief. Happy he watching, and keeping his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.)
{16:16} And he gathered them together in a place called in Hebrew Armageddon.
{16:17} And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and a great voice went out from the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.
{16:18} And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great shaking, such as was not since the time men were upon earth, such a great shaking.
{16:19} And the great city was in three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the wrath of his anger.
{16:20} And every island fled, and the mountains were not found.
{16:21} And great hail, as the weight of a talent, comes down from heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God for the blow of the hail; for its blow is exceedingly great.
{17:1} And one of the seven angels having the seven vials, came and spake with me, saying to me, Come; I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot sitting upon many waters:
{17:2} With whom the kings of the earth were debauched, and they dwelling upon the earth were intoxicated from the wine of her harlotry.
{17:3} And he brought me away in the spirit into the desert: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet wild beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
{17:4} And the woman surrounded with purple and scarlet, and covered with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the impurity of her harlotry:
{17:5} And upon her forehead a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
{17:6} And I saw the woman intoxicated from the blood of the holy, and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus: and I wondered, seeing her, with great wonder.
{17:7} And the angel said to me, Why didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the wild beast lifting her up, having seven heads and ten horns.
{17:8} The wild beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and is about to come up from the abyss, and go forward to perdition: and they dwelling upon the earth shall wonder, whose names have not been written upon the book of life from the foundation of the world, seeing the wild beast that was, and is not, although he is.
{17:9} Here the mind having wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman sits upon them.
{17:10} And there are seven kings: five fell, and one is; the other has not yet come; and when he should come, he must remain a little.
{17:11} And the wild beast which was, and is not, and this is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes forward into perdition.
{17:12} And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which took not yet the kingdom; but take power as kings one hour with the beast.
{17:13} These have one purpose, and their power and authority will they transmit to the wild beast.
{17:14} These will wage war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they with him called, and chosen, and faithful.
{17:15} And he says to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
{17:16} And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the wild beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and they shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her in fire.
{17:17} For God gave to their hearts to do his purpose, and to do one purpose, and to give their kingdom to the wild beast, till the words of God be fulfilled.
{17:18} And the woman which thou sawest is the great city, having kingdom over the kings of the earth.
{18:1} And after these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was enlightened from his glory.
{18:2} And he cried with a great, strong voice, saying, She fell, Babylon the great fell, and became the dwelling of devils, and the prison of every unclean spirit, and the prison of every unclean and detested bird.
{18:3} For of the wrath of the wine of her fornication have all nations drunk, and the kings of the earth were debauched with her, and the wholesale merchants of the earth were rich from the power of her luxury.
{18:4} And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye partake not of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
{18:5} For her sins were followed even to heaven, and God remembered her injustices.
{18:6} Give back to her as also she gave back to you, and double to her double things according to her works: in the cup in which she mixed, mix to her double.
{18:7} As much as she glorified herself, and led an insolent life, give her so much torture and grief: for in her heart she says, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and I should see no grief.
{18:8} Therefore in one day shall her blows come, death, and grief, and famine; and she shall be burned down in fire: for strong the Lord God judging her.
{18:9} And weep for her, and lament over her, shall the kings of the earth having been debauched with her, and having led an insolent life, when they see the smoke of her burning,
{18:10} Standing from far off for fear of her torture, saying, Woe, woe, the great city Babylon, the strong city! for in one hour thy judgment came.
{18:11} And the wholesale merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for their cargo will none purchase more:
{18:12} The cargo of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all fir wood, and every ivory vessel, and every vessel of precious wood, and of iron, and brass, and marble,
{18:13} And cinnamon, and perfumes, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and the finest wheat flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and of horses, and of chariots, and of bodies, and of souls of men,
{18:14} And the harvest fruit of the eager desire of thy soul departed from thee, and all fat and brilliant things departed from thee, and thou shouldest find them no more.
{18:15} The wholesale merchants of these things, having been rich from her, shall stand from far off for fear of her torture, weeping and mourning,
{18:16} And saying, Woe, woe, the great city, surrounded with fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold, and precious stones, and pearls! for in one hour was so great riches laid waste.
{18:17} And every pilot, and all the crowd upon ships, and the sailors, and as many as work the sea, stood from far off,
{18:18} And cried, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What like the great city!
{18:19} And they cast earth upon their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, in which all having ships in the sea were rich by her value! for in one hour was she rendered a desert.
{18:20} Rejoice over her, O heaven, and the holy sent, and the prophets; for God judged your judgment of her.
{18:21} And one strong angel lifted up a stone as a great millstone, and cast into the sea, saying, Thus with excitement shall Babylon, the great city, be cast down, and be found no more.
{18:22} And the voice of harp players, and musicians, and flute players, and trumpeters, should be heard in thee no more; and every artist of every art be found no more in thee; and the voice of the millstone should be heard no more in thee;
{18:23} And the light of the lamp no more should shine in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, should no more be beard in thee: for thy wholesale merchants were leaders of the earth: for with thy charms were all nations led astray.
{18:24} And in her was found the blood of the prophets, and of the holy, and of all those slain upon the earth.
{19:1} And after these things I heard the great voice of a vast multitude in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, to the Lord our God:
{19:2} For true and just his judgments: for he judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her harlotry, and he avenged the blood of his servants from her hand.
{19:3} And the second time they said, Alleluia. And her smoke goes up for ever and ever.
{19:4} And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell and worshipped God sitting upon the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.
{19:5} And a voice from the throne came out, saying, Praise our God, all his servants, and they fearing him, also small and great.
{19:6} And I heard as the voice of the vast multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of powerful thunders, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, reigned.
{19:7} Let us rejoice, and be transported with joy, and let us give glory to him: for the marriage of the Lamb came, and his wife prepared herself.
{19:8} And it was given her that she put on fine linen, pure and shining: for fine linen is the justification of the holy.
{19:9} And he says to me, Write, Happy they called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he says to me, These are the true words of God.
{19:10} And I fell before his feet to worship him. And he says to me, See, not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren having the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
{19:11} And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he sitting upon him called Faithful and True, and in justice he judges and makes war.
{19:12} And his eyes as a flame of fire, and upon his head many diadems; having a name written, which no one knows, except himself.
{19:13} And surrounded with a garment dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
{19:14} And the armies in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
{19:15} And out of his mouth went forth a sharp sword, that with it he might strike the nations: and he shall rule them with an iron rod: and he treads the winepress of the wine of the wrath and anger of God, the Omnipotent Ruler.
{19:16} And he has upon the garment and upon his thigh the name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
{19:17} And I saw one angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a great voice, saying to all the birds flying in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves to the supper of the great God;
{19:18} That ye might eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains of thousands, and the flesh of the strong, and the flesh of horses, and of them sitting upon them, and the flesh of all, free and servants, and of small and great.
{19:19} And I saw the wild beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to war with him sitting upon the horse, and with his army.
{19:20} And the wild beast was seized, and with him the false prophet having done signs before him, with which he deceived them having received the stamp of the wild beast, and them worshipping his image. Living, were they two cast into the lake of fire burning with sulphur.
{19:21} And the rest were killed by the sword of him sitting upon the horse, coming out of his mouth: and all birds were satiated from their flesh.
{20:1} And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand.
{20:2} And he seized the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
{20:3} And he cast him into the abyss, and shut him up, and affixed a seal above him, that he should no more deceive the nations, until the thousand years be finished: and after these things he must be loosed a little time.
{20:4} And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given them: and the souls of them beheaded with an axe for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and who worshipped not the wild beast, nor his image, and took not the stamp upon their foreheads, and upon their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
{20:5} And the rest of the dead returned not again to life even till the thousand years be finished. This the first rising up.
{20:6} Happy and holy he having a part in the first rising up: over these has the second death no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and they shall reign with him a thousand years.
{20:7} And when the thousand years should be finished, Satan shall be loosed from his prison,
{20:8} And he shall go forth to deceive the nations that in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for war: whose number as the sand of the sea.
{20:9} And they went up upon the breadth of the earth, and they surrounded the camp of the holy, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
{20:10} And the devil deceiving them was cast into the lake of fire and sulphur, where are the wild beast and false prophet, and they shall be tortured day and night for ever and ever.
{20:11} And I saw a great white throne, and him sitting upon it, from the face of whom the earth and the heaven fled; and there was found no place for them.
{20:12} And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is of life: and the dead were judged from the things written in the books, according to their works.
{20:13} And the sea gave the dead in it; and death and hades gave the dead in them: and they were judged each one according to their works.
{20:14} And death and hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
{20:15} And if any was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.
{21:1} And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and first earth passed away; and the sea was no more.
{21:2} And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
{21:3} And I heard a great voice from heaven saying, Behold the tent of God with men, and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, their God.
{21:4} And God shall wipe out every tear from their eyes; and death be no more, neither grief, neither crying, nor trouble shall be more: for the first things departed.
{21:5} And he sitting upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he says to me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
{21:6} And he said to me, It has been. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him thirsting of the fountain of the water of life gratuitously.
{21:7} He conquering shall inherit all things; and I will be God to him, and he shall be son to me.
{21:8} But to the cowardly, and unbelieving, and to the abominable, and murderers, and to fornicators, and charmers, and to idolaters, and to all the lying, their part in the lake burning with fire and sulphur: which is the second death,
{21:9} And there came to me one of the seven angels having the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and he spake with me, saying, Come, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.
{21:10} And he brought me away in the spirit upon a mountain great and high, and showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
{21:11} Having the glory of God: and her luminary like a most precious stone, as jasper stone, shining like crystal;
{21:12} And having a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and the names inscribed, which are of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel:
{21:13} From the sunrising three gates; from the north three gates; from the south three gates; and from the sun-setting three gates.
{21:14} And the wall of the city having twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve sent of the Lamb.
{21:15} And he speaking with me had a golden reed that he might measure the city, and her gates, and her wall.
{21:16} And the city lies quadrangular, and her length is so large, such also the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, at twelve thousand stadia. Her length, breadth, and height are equal.
{21:17} And he measured her wall, an hundred forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, which is the angel.
{21:18} And the interior construction of her wall was a jasper: and the city pure gold, like pure crystal.
{21:19} And the foundations of the wall of the city adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation a jasper; the second, a sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth an emerald:
{21:20} The fifth, a sardonyx; the sixth, a sardius; the seventh, a chrysolyte; the eighth, a beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a hyacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.
{21:21} And the twelve gates twelve pearls; each one of the gates was of one pearl: and the broad way of the city pure gold, as transparent amber.
{21:22} And a temple saw I not in her: for the Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, is the temple and the Lamb.
{21:23} And the city has no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they shine in her: for the glory of God enlightened her, and her light the Lamb.
{21:24} And the nations of the saved shall walk about in her light: and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honour into her.
{21:25} And her gates should not be shut by day: for no night shall be there.
{21:26} And they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into her.
{21:27} And there came not into her anything common, and any doing abomination, and a lie: but they written in the book of life of the Lamb.
{22:1} And he showed me the pure river of the water of life, shining as crystal, going out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
{22:2} In the midst of her broad way and of the river, hence and thence, the tree of life, making twelve fruits, in a month each one returning its fruit: and the leaves of the tree for the cure of the nations.
{22:3} And there shall be no more curse: and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in her; and his servants shall serve him:
{22:4} And they shall see his face; and his name upon their foreheads.
{22:5} And night shall not be there; and they have no need of a lamp, and the light of the sun; for the Lord God shall enlighten them: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
{22:6} And he said to me, These words faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants what must be with speed.
{22:7} Behold, I come quickly: happy he keeping the words of the prophecy of this book.
{22:8} And I John seeing these things, and hearing. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel pointing out to me these things.
{22:9} And he says to me, See, not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them keeping the words of the prophecy of this book; worship God.
{22:10} And he says to me, Thou mayest not seal the words of the prophecy of this book: for the time is near.
{22:11} He being unjust, let him be unjust yet: and he being filthy, let him be filthy yet: and the just, let him do justice yet: and the holy, let him be holy yet.
{22:12} And behold, I come swiftly; and my reward with me, to give back to each as shall be his work.
{22:13} I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
{22:14} Happy they doing his commands, that their power shall be in the tree of life, and they might come in at the gates to the city.
{22:15} And without, dogs, and charmers and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and every one loving and doing a lie.
{22:16} I Jesus sent mine angel to testify these things to you, to the churches. I am the root and stock of David, the shining and morning star.
{22:17} And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him hearing say, Come. And let him thirsting come. And let him wishing, take the water of life freely.
{22:18} For I testify to every one hearing the words of the prophecy of this book, If any add to these things, God will add to him the blows written in this book:
{22:19} And if any take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the book of life, and from the holy city, and from the things written in this book.
{22:20} He testifying says, Yes, I come swiftly. Amen. Yes, come, Lord Jesus.
{22:21} The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen.
