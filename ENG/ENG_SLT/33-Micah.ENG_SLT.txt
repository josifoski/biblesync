{1:1} The word of Jehovah which was to Micah the Morasthite, in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, who saw upon Shomeron and Jerusalem.
{1:2} Hear, all ye peoples; attend, O earth, and its fulness, and the Lord Jehovah shall be among you for a witness, Jehovah from his holy temple.
{1:3} For behold, Jehovah will come forth from his place, and come down and tread upon the heights of the earth.
{1:4} And the mountains melted under him, and the valleys shall be cleft as wax from the face of the fire, as waters cast down in a descent.
{1:5} For the transgression of Jacob all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel What the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Shomeron? And what the heights of Judah? Are they not Jerusalem?
{1:6} And I set Shomeron for the rubbish of the field, for the plantings of a vineyard: and I poured down its stones into the valley, and I will uncover its foundations.
{1:7} And all her carved images shall be beaten down, and all her gifts shall be burnt in fire, and all her images I will set a desolation: for she gathered from the gift of a harlot, and they shall turn back even to the gift of a harlot.
{1:8} For this I will lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked: I will make wailing as jackals, and mourning as the daughters of the ostrich.
{1:9} For her blow is incurable, for it came even to Judah; he touched even to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
{1:10} Ye shall not announce in Gath; weeping, ye shall not weep: in the house of dust roll thyself in dust.
{1:11} Pass away for you, thou fair one inhabiting the nakedness of shame: she inhabiting the place of flocks shall not go forth to the wailing of the house of firm root; he shall take from you his standing.
{1:12} For she dwelling in bitterness was anxious for good: but evil came down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem.
{1:13} Make fast the chariot to the steed, thou inhabitress of the smitten: she the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion: for in thee were found the transgressions of Israel.
{1:14} For this thou shalt give a sending forth upon the possession of Gath: the houses of falsehood are for falsehood to the kings of Israel.
{1:15} Yet I will bring to thee him possessing, O inhabitress at the head: he shall come even to Adullam, the glory of Israel.
{1:16} Make bald, and shave for the sons of thy delights; increase thy baldness as the eagle; for they were carried away captive from thee.
{2:1} Wo to them purposing vanity, and working evil upon their beds! In the light of the morning they will do it because it is to the strength of their hand.
{2:2} And they desired fields, and they took by force; and houses, and they took away: and they oppressed a man and his house, and a man and his inheritance.
{2:3} For this, thus said Jehovah: Behold me purposing evil against this family, which ye shall not remove your necks from thence; and ye shall not go loftily: for it is an evil time.
{2:4} In that day a parable shall be lifted up against you, and a wailing of a wailing was wailed, saying, Being laid waste, we shall be laid waste: he will exchange a portion of my people: how he will remove to me; for turning away, he will divide our fields.
{2:5} For this there shall not be to thee any casting a cord by lot in the convocation of Jehovah.
{2:6} Ye shall not let fall in drops; they shall let fall in drops; they shall not let fall in drops for these; shame shall not be removed.
{2:7} Causing the house of Jacob to say, Was the spirit of Jehovah shortened? if these his doings? shall not my words do good to a people going straight?
{2:8} Aforetime my people for the enemy: he will raise them up from before the garment; ye will put off the wide cloak from those passing by with confidence, turning back the war.
{2:9} The women of my people ye will thrust out from the house of her delights; from her children ye will take my majesty forever.
{2:10} Arise ye, and go, for this is not the rest: because it was defiled it will destroy, and with a sore destruction.
{2:11} If a man going in the spirit and falsehood, lying, I will drop to thee for wine and for strong drink; and he was the dropping of this people.
{2:12} Gathering, O Jacob, I will gather all of thee; collecting, I will collect the remnant of Israel; together I will set them as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their pasture they shall make noise from man.
{2:13} He breaking forth came up before them: they broke forth and they will pass through the gate, they will go forth by it; and their king will pass through before them and Jehovah at their head.
{3:1} And saying, Hear now, ye heads of Jacob, and ye judges of the house of Israel: Is it not for you to know judgment?
{3:2} Hating the good and loving the evil; plucking off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones.
{3:3} And who ate the flesh of my people, and they stripped off their skin from off them; and they brake their bones in pieces, and separated as for the pot, and as flesh in the midst of the kettle.
{3:4} Then shall they cry to Jehovah and he will not answer them, and he will hide his face from them in that time, as their doings were evil.
{3:5} Thus said Jehovah for the prophets causing my people to wander, and biting with their teeth, and they called, Peace; and who will not give upon their mouth and they consecrated war against him:
{3:6} For this, night to you from a vision, and darkness to you from divining; and the sun went down upon the prophets, and the day was dark upon them.
{3:7} And they seeing were ashamed, and they divining were disgraced, and they covered over their lip, all of them; for no answer of God.
{3:8} But I was filled with power, with the spirit of Jehovah, and judgment and strength to announce to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
{3:9} Hear now this, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and judges of the house of Israel abhorring judgment, and they will pervert all uprightness.
{3:10} Building Zion with bloods and Jerusalem with iniquity.
{3:11} Her heads will judge for a gift, and her priests will teach for hire, and her prophets will divine for silver: and they will lean upon Jehovah, saying, Is not Jehovah in the midst of us? he will not bring evil upon us.
{3:12} For this, on account of you Zion shall be ploughed a field, and Jerusalem shall be ruins, and the mountain of the house for the heights of the forest.
{4:1} And it was in the last of the days the mountain of the house of Jehovah will be prepared upon the head of the mountains, and it was lifted up above the hills, and peoples flowed to it.
{4:2} And many nations went and said, Come, and we will go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us from his ways, and we will go in his paths: from Zion will instruction go forth, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.
{4:3} And he judged between many peoples, and he admonished to strong nations even to far off; and they beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning-knives: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, and they shall no more learn war.
{4:4} And they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and none terrifying: for the mouth of Jehovah of armies spake.
{4:5} For all peoples shall go each in the name of his God, and will go in the name of Jehovah our God for ever and ever.
{4:6} In that day, says Jehovah, I will assemble her halting, and I will gather her thrust out, and whom I broke in pieces.
{4:7} And I set her halting for a remnant, and her far removed, for a strong nation: and Jehovah reigning over them in mount Zion from now and even to forever.
{4:8} And thou, O tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, even to thee shall it come, and the first dominion: came the kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem.
{4:9} Now wherefore wilt thou cry out with an outcry? is no king in thee? or thy counselor perished? for pain laid hold of thee as she bringing forth.
{4:10} Be in pain and bring forth, O daughter of Zion, as she bringing forth: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and dwell in the field, and going even to Babel; there shalt thou be delivered; there Jehovah will redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.
{4:11} And now many nations were gathered against thee, saying, She shall be defiled, and our eyes shall look upon Zion.
{4:12} And they knew not the purposes of Jehovah, and they understood not his counsel for he gathered them as sheaves of the threshing-floor.
{4:13} Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will set thy horn iron, and thy hoofs of brass: and thou didst crush many peoples: and I devoted their plunder to Jehovah, and their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.
{5:1} Now thou shalt crowd thyself together, O daughter of a troop: besieging there against us; with a rod they will strike the judge of Israel upon the cheek.
{5:2} And thou, house of bread, of Ephratah, for being small among the thousands of Judah, out of thee shall come forth to me he being ruler in Israel; and his goings forth from of old from the days of eternity.
{5:3} For this he will give them up even till the time she bearing will bring forth: and the remainder of his brethren shall turn back to the sons of Israel.
{5:4} And he stood and fed in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of Jehovah his God; and they shall dwell: for now shall he be magnified to the ends of the earth.
{5:5} And this was peace, for Assur shall come up into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces and we raised against him seven shepherds, and eight anointed men.
{5:6} And they ruled the land of Assur with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in its openings: and he delivered from Assur when he shall come in to our land, and when he shall tread in our bound.
{5:7} And the remnant of Jacob was in the midst of many peoples as the dew from Jehovah, as showers upon the green herb, which will not wait for man and will not delay for the sons of man.
{5:8} And the remnant of Jacob was among the nations in the midst of many peoples as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he passed through, and he trod down and pulled in pieces, and none delivering.
{5:9} Thy hand shall be raised up against thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.
{5:10} And it was in that day, says Jehovah, and I cut off thy horses from the midst of thee, and I destroyed thy chariots.
{5:11} And I cut off the cities of thy land, and I battled down all thy fortresses:
{5:12} And I cut off sorceries from thy hand, and they practicing magic shall not be to thee.
{5:13} And I cut off thy carved images and thy statues from the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands.
{5:14} And I tore up thine images from the midst of thee, and I destroyed thy cities.
{5:15} And I did vengeance in anger and in wrath with the nations, which they heard not.
{6:1} Hear ye now what Jehovah said: Arise, contend thou with the mountains, and the hills shall hear thy voice.
{6:2} Hear ye mountains the contention of Jehovah, and ye perpetual foundations of the earth: for a contention to Jehovah with his people, and he will dispute with Israel.
{6:3} My people, what did I to thee? and in what did I weary thee? answer to me.
{6:4} For I brought thee up from the land of Egypt, and from the house of servants I redeemed thee; and I shall send before thy face, Moses, Aaron and, Miriam.
{6:5} O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab counseled, and what Balaam son of Beor answered him from the acacias even to Gilgal; in order to know the justice of Jehovah.
{6:6} With what shall I come before Jehovah? I will bow to the high God; shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves, the sons of a year?
{6:7} Will Jehovah delight in thousands of rams, in ten thousands of torrents of oil? shall I give my first-born my transgression? the fruit of my belly, the sin of my soul?
{6:8} He announced to thee, O man, what was good; and what did Jehovah require of thee but to do judgment and to love mercy, and being humbled, to go with thy God?
{6:9} The voice of Jehovah will call to the city, and wisdom feared thy name: hear ye the rod, and who appointed it.
{6:10} Are there yet treasures of injustice in the house of the unjust, and the ephah of leanness being cursed?
{6:11} Shall I make clean with the balances of injustice, and with the bag of stones of deceit?
{6:12} For her rich ones were full of violence, and her inhabitants spake falsehood, and their tongue of deceit in their mouth.
{6:13} And also I made sick, striking thee, making desolate for thy sins.
{6:14} Thou shalt eat and not be satisfied; and thine emptiness in the midst of thee; and thou shalt remove and shalt not deliver; and what thou shalt save I will give to the sword.
{6:15} Thou shalt sow and thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olive and thou shalt not anoint thyself with oil; and new wine, and thou shalt not drink wine.
{6:16} The laws of Omri will be observed, and all the work of the house of Ahab, and ye will go in their counsels; so that I shall give thee for a desolation, and her inhabitants for hissing, and ye shall bear the reproach of my People.
{7:1} Wo to me! for I was as the gatherings of the fruit harvest, as the gleanings of the vintage, no cluster to eat: my soul desired the first ripe fig.
{7:2} The merciful one perished from the earth, and none upright among men: they all will lie in wait for bloods; they will hunt each his brother with a net.
{7:3} For doing evil with the hands to do well, the chief asking, and the judge, for peace; and the great one, he spake the mischief of his soul: and they will entangle it.
{7:4} Their good as the thorn, the upright more than the thorn-hedge: the day of thy watchings and thy reviewings came; now shall be their perplexity.
{7:5} Ye shall not trust in a companion, ye shall not confide in a friend: watch the doors of thy mouth from her lying in thy bosom.
{7:6} For the son despising the father, the daughter rising up against her mother, the bride against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies the men of his house.
{7:7} I will look about for Jehovah, I will wait for God my deliverer; my God will hear me.
{7:8} Thou shalt not rejoice against me, O mine enemy: if I fell I arose: if I shall sit in darkness, Jehovah a light to me.
{7:9} The anger of Jehovah I will bear, for I sinned against him till he shall maintain my contention, and do my judgment: he will bring me forth to the light, I shall look upon his justice.
{7:10} And mine enemy shall see, and shame shall cover her saying to me, Where Jehovah thy God? Mine eyes shall look upon her: now shall she be for treading down as the mire of the streets.
{7:11} The day for the building of thy walls, that day shall the law be removed far off.
{7:12} That day he shall come even to thee from Assur and the fortified cities, and from the fortress and even to the river, and from sea to sea, and mountain to mountain.
{7:13} And the land was for a desolation upon its inhabitants from the fruit of their doings.
{7:14} Feed my people with thy rod, the sheep of thine inheritance dwelling by themselves in the forest, in the midst of Carmel: they shall feed Bashan and Gilead as the days of old.
{7:15} According to the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt I will cause him to see wonderful things.
{7:16} The nations shall see and be ashamed from all their strength: they shall put the hand upon the mouth, their ears shall be deaf.
{7:17} They shall lick the dust as the serpent, as crawlers of the earth they shall move out of their close places: for Jehovah our God they shall tremble and they shall fear from thee.
{7:18} Who is God as thee, lifting up iniquity and passing by transgression to the remnant of his inheritance? he held not his anger forever for he delighted in mercy.
{7:19} He will turn back, he will compassionate us: he will subdue our iniquities, and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
{7:20} Thou wilt give truth to Jacob, mercy to Abraham, which thou didst swear to our fathers from the days of old.
