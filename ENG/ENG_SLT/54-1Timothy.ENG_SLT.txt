{1:1} Paul, the sent of Jesus Christ according to the command of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, our hope;
{1:2} To Timothy, genuine child in the faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God our Father, and Jesus Christ our Lord.
{1:3} As I besought thee to remain in Ephesus, going into Macedonia, that thou mightest proclaim to some not to teach another doctrine,
{1:4} Neither hold to fictions and endless genealogies, which offer questions, rather than the arrangement of God in the faith:
{1:5} (And the end of the proclamation is love out of a pure heart, and a good consciousness, and unfeigned faith:
{1:6} Which some having missed turned away to vain discourse.
{1:7} Wishing to be teachers of the law; neither understanding what they say, nor of certain things they are assured.
{1:8} And we know the law good, if any use it lawfully;
{1:9} Knowing this, that the law is laid down not for the just one, but for the lawless and disorderly, for the profane and sinful, for the wicked and unholy, for the patricides and matricides, for manslayers,
{1:10} For fornicators, unchaste, manstealers, liars, the perjured, and if there be any other thing opposed to sound doctrine;
{1:11} According to the good news of the glory of the blessed God, with which I was entrusted.
{1:12} And I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, having strengthened me, for he deemed me faithful, having set me in the service;
{1:13} Being before slandering, expelling, and an abuser: but I was commiserated, because I did, not knowing, in unbelief.
{1:14} And the grace of our Lord superabounded with faith and love in Christ Jesus.
{1:15} Faithful the word, and worthy of all acceptance, for Christ Jesus came into the world to save the sinful; of whom I am first.
{1:16} But for this was I commiserated, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering, for a model to them about to believe on him to eternal life.
{1:17} And to the King of times, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, honour and glory for the times of times. Amen.)
{1:18} This proclamation I set before thee, child Timothy, according to the gifts of prophecy led before upon thee, that thou in them mightest war the good warfare;
{1:19} Having faith, and a good consciousness; which some having rejected concerning faith suffered shipwreck:
{1:20} Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they should not be taught to blaspheme.
{2:1} I Beseech therefore, first of all, supplications to be made, prayers, entreaties, thanks, for all men;
{2:2} For kings, and all them being in eminence; that we may lead a gentle and quiet life, in all devotion and gravity.
{2:3} For this good and acceptable before our Saviour God;
{2:4} Who wills all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
{2:5} For one God, and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
{2:6} Having given himself a ransom for all, a testimony in his own time.
{2:7} For which I was placed a herald, and the sent, (I speak truth in Christ, I lie not;) a teacher of the nations in faith and truth.
{2:8} I will therefore men shall pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without anger and reasoning.
{2:9} And likewise the women in well arranged simplicity, with modesty and discretion, arrange themselves; not in tresses, or gold, or pearls, or expensive clothing;
{2:10} But (what become women professing religious worship) with good works.
{2:11} Let the woman, in freedom from care, learn in all subjection.
{2:12} And I trust not the woman to teach, neither to exercise authority over the man, but to be in freedom from care.
{2:13} For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
{2:14} And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, was in the transgression.
{2:15} And she shall be saved through the bringing forth children, if they remain in faith and love and consecration with discretion.
{3:1} Faithful the word, If any strive for superintendence, he eagerly desires a good work.
{3:2} Therefore an overseer must be irreprehensible, husband of one wife, sober, of sound mind, well arranged, hospitable, giving instruction;
{3:3} Not intoxicated, not a quarrelsome person, not occupied in sordid gain; but equitable, without fighting, exempt from avarice;
{3:4} Presiding well over his own house, having the children in subjection with all gravity;
{3:5} (And if any know not to preside over his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
{3:6} Not newly planted, lest rendered proud he fall into condemnation of the accuser.
{3:7} And he must also have good testimony from them without;lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the accuser.
{3:8} Deacons likewise grave, not speaking equivocally, not holding to much wine, not occupied in sordid gain;
{3:9} Having the mystery of faith in pure consciousness.
{3:10} And let these also first be tried; then let them perform the office of footman, being blameless.
{3:11} Wives also grave, not accusers, sober, faithful in all things.
{3:12} Let the deacons be husbands of one wife, presiding well over the children and their own houses.
{3:13} For they having served well, acquire to themselves a good step, and much freedom of speech in the faith which in Christ Jesus.
{3:14} These I write to thee, hoping to come to thee quickly:
{3:15} And if I delay, that thou shouldest know how thou must be occupied in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.
{3:16} And manifestly great is the mystery of devotion: God was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed in the nations, was believed on in the world, was received up in glory.
{4:1} And the Spirit says expressly, that in later times some shall be removed from the faith, holding to deceitful spirits, and doctrines of evil spirits;
{4:2} In the hypocrisy of speaking falsely; burned with a hot iron in their own consciousness;
{4:3} Hindering to marry, to keep from victuals which God created for participation, with thanks, for the faithful and them knowing the truth.
{4:4} For every created thing of God good, and nothing thrown away, received with thanks:
{4:5} For it is consecrated by the word of God and entreaty.
{4:6} These having laid down to the brethren, thou shalt be a good servant of Jesus Christ, brought up in the words of faith and good doctrine, which thou hast closely followed.
{4:7} And profane and old women's fictions reject, and exercise thyself in devotion.
{4:8} For bodily exercise is profitable, to little: but devotion is profitable to all things, having promise of life now, and that about to be.
{4:9} Faithful the word, and worthy of all acceptance.
{4:10} For, for this also we are wearied and reproached, that we have hoped in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, chiefly of the faithful.
{4:11} Proclaim and teach these things.
{4:12} Let none despise thy youth; but be thou a type of the faithful, in word, in intercourse, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
{4:13} Till I come, hold to reading loud, to entreaty, to doctrine.
{4:14} Neglect not the power which in thee, which was given thee by the gift of prophecy, with the putting on of hands of the council of elders.
{4:15} Bestow diligent care upon these things; be in them; that thy progress may be manifest in all things.
{4:16} Take heed to thyself, and to the doctrine; remain in them: for doing this, and thou shalt save thyself, and them hearing thee.
{5:1} An elder shouldest thou not reprove, but beseech as a father; the younger as brethren;
{5:2} The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.
{5:3} Honour widows, truly widows.
{5:4} And if any widow have children or descendants, let them learn first to be pious to their own house, and to return recompenses to their progenitors: for this is good and acceptable before God.
{5:5} And she truly a widow, and forsaken, has hoped in God, and remains in supplications and prayers night and day.
{5:6} And she living luxuriously is dead, living.
{5:7} And these things proclaim, that they might be irreprehensible.
{5:8} And if any for his own, and chiefly for his own household provide not, he has denied the faith, and is worse than the unbelieving.
{5:9} Let not a widow be chosen less than sixty years, having been wife of one man,
{5:10} Testified of in good works; if she have brought up children, if she lodged strangers, if she washed the feet of the holy, if she relieved the pressed, if she followed every good work.
{5:11} And the younger widows reject: for when they conduct themselves arrogantly against Christ, they wish to marry:
{5:12} Having judgment, for they put away the first faith.
{5:13} And at the same time also they learn to be idle, going round about the houses; and not only idle, but also indulging in idle talk, and occupied with unnecessary things, speaking things not becoming.
{5:14} I wish therefore the younger to marry, to bear children, to rule the house, to give no occasion to him opposing for reproach.
{5:15} For already have some turned aside after Satan.
{5:16} If any man or woman faithful have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be loaded; that it may relieve the truly widows.
{5:17} Let the elders having presided well be deemed worthy of double honour, chiefly they being wearied in word and doctrine.
{5:18} For the writing says, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox grinding. And, The laborer worthy of his hire.
{5:19} Against an elder receive not an accusation from without, except from two or three witnesses.
{5:20} Them having sinned rebuke before all, that the rest also have fear.
{5:21} I call to witness before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the chosen angels, that thou watch these things without preference, doing nothing by bending.
{5:22} Put hands swiftly upon none, nor participate in others' sins: keep thyself pure.
{5:23} Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach and thy frequent weaknesses.
{5:24} Some men's sins are manifest, going before to judgment; and also to some they follow in the train.
{5:25} Likewise also the good works of some are manifest; and having these otherwise, it cannot be hid.
{6:1} Let as many servants as are under the yoke deem their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and the doctrines be not defamed.
{6:2} And let them having faithful masters not despise, for they are brethren; but rather let them serve, because they are faithful and dearly beloved, they having mutually received of the beneficence. These things teach and beseech.
{6:3} If any teach otherwise, and come not up to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine according to devotion;
{6:4} He has been proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and disputes of words, of which is envy, strife, slanders, evil conjectures,
{6:5} Unprofitable occupations of men corrupted in mind, and deprived of the truth, thinking gain to be devotion: be separated from such.
{6:6} But devotion with contentment is great gain.
{6:7} For we brought nothing into the world, it is manifest that neither are we able to carry anything out.
{6:8} And having sustenance and covering, with these let us be contented.
{6:9} And they wishing to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and many eager desires, unwise and hurtful, which sink men into ruin and perdition.
{6:10} For the root of all evils is the love of money: which some striving for, have been led astray from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many pains.
{6:11} And thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow justice, devotion, faith, love, patience, meekness.
{6:12} Contend earnestly the good contest of faith, take hold upon eternal life, into which thou wert also called, and hast confessed the good confession before many witnesses.
{6:13} I beseech thee before God, making all things alive, and Christ Jesus, he having witnessed to Pontius Pilate the good confession;
{6:14} For thee to keep the command spotless, irreprehensible, until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ:
{6:15} Which the blessed and only sovereign shall show in his own times, the King of those reigning, and Lord of those ruling;
{6:16} Who only having immortality, inhabiting inaccessible light; which none of men saw, nor can see; to whom honour and might forever. Amen.
{6:17} To the rich now in this life, proclaim not to be highminded, nor to be hoping upon the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, offering us all things richly for profit;
{6:18} To do good, to be rich in good works, to be liberal, qualified for participation;
{6:19} Treasuring up to themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold upon eternal life.
{6:20} O Timothy, watch that which holds firm, turning aside from profane, idle talk, and oppositions of knowledge, bearing a false name:
{6:21} Which some proclaiming have missed their aim concerning the faith. Grace with thee. Amen.
