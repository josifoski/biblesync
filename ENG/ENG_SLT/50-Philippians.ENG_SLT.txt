{1:1} Paul and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the holy in Christ Jesus at Philippi, with the overseers and servants:
{1:2} Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
{1:3} I return thanks to my God for all your remembrance,
{1:4} Always in all my prayer for you all with joy making prayer,
{1:5} For your mutual participation in the good news from the first day until now;
{1:6} Confident of this same, that he having begun a good work in you will complete till the day of Jesus Christ:
{1:7} As it is just for me to think this concerning you all, for my having you in the heart; both in my bonds, and in the justification and confirmation of the good news, ye all being partakers of grace with me.
{1:8} For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
{1:9} And this I prey, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all intelligence;
{1:10} For you to try things differing; that ye may be pure and not stumbling to the day of Christ;
{1:11} Filled with the fruits of justice, by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
{1:12} And I wish you to know, brethren, that the things concerning me have rather gone to the advancement of the good news;
{1:13} So that my bonds in Christ were manifest in the whole pretorium, and to all the rest;
{1:14} And many of the brethren in the Lord, having trusted to my bonds, more abundantly dared to speak the word fearlessly.
{1:15} And some truly by envy and strife, and some also by kindness of disposition, proclaim Christ.
{1:16} Some truly of hired labor announce Christ, not purely, thinking to bring pressure upon my bonds:
{1:17} And some of love, knowing that I am placed for justification of the good news:
{1:18} For what? but in any manner, whether in pretence, or truth, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice, and certainly I will rejoice.
{1:19} For I know that this shall be turned to me for salvation by your prayer, and the furnishing more of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
{1:20} According to my anxious expectation, and hope, that in nothing shall I be ashamed, but in all freedom of speech, as always, and now shall Christ be Magnified in my body, whether by life, whether by death.
{1:21} For me to live is Christ, and to die gain.
{1:22} And if to live in the flesh, this to me the fruit of work: and whether I shall be taken away I know not.
{1:23} For I am pressed together from two, having one eager desire to be loosed, and be with Christ (rather much better:)
{1:24} And to tarry yet longer in the flesh is more necessary for you.
{1:25} And confident in this, I know that I shall remain, and shall remain near together with you all for your advancement and joy of faith:
{1:26} That your boasting may abound in Jesus Christ in me, for my coming again to you.
{1:27} Only live as citizens worthy of the good news of Christ: that whether coming and seeing you, whether being absent, I shall bear the things concerning you, that ye stand in one spirit, one soul, fighting together in faith of the good news;
{1:28} And terrified in nothing by them being hostile to you: which to them is truly an indication of destruction, and to you of salvation, and this from God.
{1:29} For upon you was it conferred as a favor for Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him;
{1:30} Having the same struggle which ye saw in me, and now hear in me.
{2:1} If therefore any consolation in Christ, if any encouragement of love, if any mutual participation of the Spirit, if any compassions and mercies,
{2:2} Fill ye up my joy, that ye may have the same in mind, having the same love, unanimous, being one in mind.
{2:3} Nothing by hired labor, or vainglory; but in lowliness the leaders hold each other above themselves.
{2:4} Look ye each not on the things of themselves, but also each the things of others.
{2:5} For let this be in mind among you, which also in Christ Jesus;
{2:6} Who, being in the form of God, thought not robbery to be equal to God.
{2:7} But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, born in the likeness of men:
{2:8} And found in fashion as man, he humbled himself, being obedient until death, and the death of the cross.
{2:9} Wherefore God has also exceedingly exalted him, and favored him as a gift with a name above every name:
{2:10} That in the name of Jesus every knee should bend, of the heavenlies, and of terrestrial things, and things under earth
{2:11} And every tongue should avow that the Lord is Jesus Christ, to the glory of the Father.
{2:12} Therefore, my beloved, as ye have always listened, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, with fear and tremor effect your own salvation.
{2:13} For God is working in you also to will and to work by benevolence.
{2:14} Do ye all things without murmurings and discussions:
{2:15} That ye be complete and pure, children of God, blameless in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom ye appear as luminaries in the world;
{2:16} Holding on to the word of life; for boasting to me in the day of Christ, for I ran not in vain, nor was I wearied in vain.
{2:17} But if also I am poured out upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice together with you all.
{2:18} And do ye also rejoice at the same, and rejoice together with me.
{2:19} And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy quickly to you, that I also be courageous, having known the things concerning you.
{2:20} For I have none having a like soul, who naturally will have care for the things concerning you.
{2:21} For they all seek the things of themselves, and not the things of Christ Jesus.
{2:22} And ye know his proof, that, as a child to a father, he served with me in the good news.
{2:23} Him therefore I truly hope to send, whenever I shall see from it the things concerning me.
{2:24} And I have trusted in the Lord that I myself also shall come quickly.
{2:25} And I thought necessary Epaphroditus, my brother, and cooperator, and fellow-soldier, and your sent, and workman of my necessity, be sent to you.
{2:26} Since he was longing for you all, and harassed because ye heard that he was sick.
{2:27} For also he was sick near to death: but God compassionated him; and not him only, but also me, lest I should have grief upon grief.
{2:28} Therefore I sent him the more earnestly, that, seeing him, ye might again rejoice, and I be more free from sorrow.
{2:29} Therefore receive him in the Lord with all joy; and hold such esteemed.
{2:30} Because for the work of Christ he drew near to death, having exposed the soul to danger, that he might fill up your want of service to me.
{3:1} As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me is not slothful, and to you safe.
{3:2} Look out for dogs, look out for evil workmen, look out for the incision.
{3:3} For we are the circumcision, serving God in spirit, and boasting in Christ Jesus, and not trusting in the flesh.
{3:4} Although I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other think to have confidence in the flesh, I more:
{3:5} Circumcision done the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;
{3:6} For zeal, driving out the church; for justice in the law, not to be found fault with.
{3:7} But what things were gain to me, these I have thought loss for Christ.
{3:8} But surely, I also think all things to be loss for the superiority of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have been made to lose all things, and I think to be offscourings, that I shall gain Christ,
{3:9} And be found in him, not having my justice, that of the law, but that by faith of Christ, the justice from God by faith:
{3:10} To know him, and the power of his rising up, and the mutual participation of his sufferings, being rendered conformable to his death;
{3:11} If somehow I shall arrive at the rising up of the dead.
{3:12} Not that I have already attained or have been already perfected: and I pursue, if I also may overtake, for which also I was overtaken by Christ Jesus.
{3:13} Brethren, I reckon not myself to have been overtaken: but one, truly forgetting things behind, and stretching still farther to things before,
{3:14} I pursue toward the scope for the prize of combat of the calling above of God in Christ Jesus.
{3:15} Therefore, as many as are completed, let us have this in mind; and if in any thing ye think otherwise, God will also reveal this to you.
{3:16} But, at what we before arrived, to walk by the same rule, to think the same.
{3:17} Be ye imitators together of me, brethren, and observe narrowly those walking thus, as ye have us for a type.
{3:18} (For many walk, of whom I said to you often, and now also say weeping, the enemies of the cross of Christ:
{3:19} Whose end destruction, whose God the belly, and their glory in shame, having in mind earthly things.)
{3:20} For our citizenship is in the heavens; from whence we also expect the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
{3:21} Who will change the body of our humiliation, for it to be conformable to the body of his glory, according to the operation by which he is able to place all things under himself.
{4:1} Therefore, my brethren, dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, thus stand ye in the Lord, dearly beloved.
{4:2} I beseech Euodias, and I beseech Syntyche, to think the same in the Lord.
{4:3} And I also ask thee, worthy yoke fellow, aid those women who fought in company with me in the good news, and with Clement, and the rest of my co-workers, whose names in the book of life.
{4:4} Rejoice in the Lord always: again say I, Do ye rejoice.
{4:5} Let your fitness be known to all men. The Lord is near.
{4:6} Rave anxiety about nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with gratitude let your desires be made known to God.
{4:7} And the peace of God, surpassing all understanding, shall watch your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
{4:8} As to the rest, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever venerable, whatever just, whatever pure, whatever lovely, whatever prosperous; if any ability, and if any praise, reckon up these things.
{4:9} And what things ye learned, and received, and heard, and saw in me, these do; and the God of peace shall be with you.
{4:10} And I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that once already ye recovered new vigor; for thinking of me, upon whom ye were thinking, and ye had not time.
{4:11} Not that I speak concerning want; for I have learned, among whom I am, to be satisfied with my condition.
{4:12} And I know how to be humble, and I know how to abound in every thing: and in all I am instructed also to be full and to hunger, and to abound and to be in want.
{4:13} I am strong for all things in Christ strengthening me.
{4:14} But ye did well, participating together in my pressure.
{4:15} And ye also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the good news, when I went out from Macedonia, no church participated with me in the word of donation and accepting, except ye alone.
{4:16} For also in Thessalonica, and once, and twice, ye sent to my necessity.
{4:17} Not that I covet a gift: but I covet fruit abounding to your word.
{4:18} And I have all, and abound: I have been filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things from you, a smell of sweet odor, a sacrifice acceptable, pleasing to God.
{4:19} And God will fill up all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
{4:20} And to God and our Father the glory for the times of times. Amen.
{4:21} Greet ye every one holy in Christ Jesus. The brethren with me greet you.
{4:22} All the holy greet you, and chiefly they from Caesar's house.
{4:23} The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen.
