{1:1} Paul, servant of Jesus Christ, called sent, separated to the good news of God,
{1:2} (Which he before promised by his prophets in the holy writings,)
{1:3} Concerning his Son born of the seed of David according to the flesh.
{1:4} Determined the Son of God in power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the rising up of the dead of Jesus Christ our Lord:
{1:5} By whom we received grace and sending forth, to the obedience of faith in all nations for his name:
{1:6} In whom are ye also, the called of Jesus Christ:
{1:7} To all being in Rome, beloved of God, called holy: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
{1:8} First, I return thanks to my God by Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is announced in the whole world.
{1:9} For my witness is God, whom I serve in my spirit in the good news of his Son, so that continually I make mention of you, always supplicating in my prayers;
{1:10} If in any way I shall be prospered on my way in the will of God to come to you.
{1:11} For I long to see you, That I might impart to you some spiritual grace, in order for you to be firm;
{1:12} And this is, to be comforted together in you by the faith in one another both of you and of me.
{1:13} And I would not ye should be ignorant, brethren, that many times I proposed to come to you, (and I was hindered till this time,) that I might have some fruit also in you, and in the rest of the nations.
{1:14} Both to Greeks, and foreigners; both to wise and unwise, I am debtor.
{1:15} So that for my part being zealous, also to you that in Rome, to announce the good news.
{1:16} For I am not ashamed of the good news of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to all believing; both to the Jew first, and the Greek.
{1:17} For the justice of God in it is revealed from faith to faith: as has been written, And the just shall live by faith.
{1:18} For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all profanation and injustice of men, of those detaining the truth in injustice;
{1:19} Wherefore that known of God is manifest in them; for God manifested to them.
{1:20} For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world, being understood by things made, are inspected, truly both his eternal power and divinity; so that they are inexcusable:
{1:21} Wherefore having known God, not as God did they honour or return thanks; but were rendered vain in their conversations, and their heart without understanding was darkened.
{1:22} Declaring themselves to be wise, they were fools,
{1:23} And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of flying things, and of creeping things, and of quadrupeds.
{1:24} Wherefore God delivered them in the eager desire of their hearts to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies in themselves:
{1:25} Who changed the truth of God into a falsehood, and reverenced and served the creation above him creating, who is praised forever. Amen.
{1:26} Therefore God delivered them to the suffering of ignominy: for also their females changed the natural use into that against generation:
{1:27} Likewise also males, leaving the natural use of the female, were set on fire in their longing for one another; males with males working deformity, and the retribution which was needed receiving in themselves for their erring.
{1:28} And as they chose not to have God in knowledge, God delivered them to an adulterated purpose, to do things not fitting;
{1:29} Having been filled with all injustice, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, badness; full of envy, slaughter, strife, deceit, malignity,
{1:30} Whisperers, slanderers, odious to God, abusers of power, proud, tumultuous, inventors of injuries, disobedient to parents,
{1:31} Destitute of understanding, unsteady, devoid of natural affection, implacable, merciless:
{1:32} Who knowing the justice of God, that they doing such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but also approve those doing.
{2:1} Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, every one judging: for in what thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou judging doest the same.
{2:2} And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon them doing such things.
{2:3} And thinkest thou this, O man, judging them doing such things, and doing the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
{2:4} Or the abundance of his goodness and forbearance and long suffering dost thou despise; not knowing that the goodness of God brings thee to repentance?
{2:5} And according to thy hardness and impenitent heart thou treasurest up to thyself anger in the day of anger and revelation of the just judgment of God;
{2:6} Who will give back to each according to his works:
{2:7} To them truly by perseverance of the good work they seek glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
{2:8} But to them of intrigue, and are truly disobedient to the truth, and yielding to injustice, anger and wrath,
{2:9} Affliction and distress, upon every soul of man working evil, both of the Jew first, and of the Greek;
{2:10} But glory, and honour, and peace, to every one working good, both to the Jew first, and to the Greek:
{2:11} For there is no distinction of persons with God.
{2:12} For as many as sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
{2:13} (For not hearers of the law just with God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
{2:14} For when nations, not having the things of the law, by nature do the things of the law, these, not having the law, are law to themselves:
{2:15} Which show the work of the law Written in their hearts, their consciousness testifying together, and between one another thoughts accusing or also excusing;)
{2:16} In the day when God shall judge the concealed things of men according to my good news by Jesus Christ.
{2:17} Behold, thou art named a Jew, and restest upon the law, and boastest thyself in God,
{2:18} And knowest the will, and triest things differing, being sounded out of the law;
{2:19} And art persuaded thou thyself to be a guide of the blind, a light of them in darkness,
{2:20} An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the inexperienced, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.
{2:21} Therefore teaching another, teachest thou not thyself proclaiming not to steal, stealest thou?
{2:22} Speaking not to commit adultery, committest thou adultery? abhorring images, committest thou sacrilege?
{2:23} Thou who boastest in the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest thou God?
{2:24} For the name of God by you is blasphemed in the nations, as it has been written.
{2:25} For truly circumcision profits, if thou do the law: and if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision has become uncircumcision.
{2:26} Therefore if uncircumcision watch the justification of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision?
{2:27} And shall not uncircumcision by nature, completing the law, judge thee, which by letter and circumcision a transgressor of the law?
{2:28} For he in appearance, is not a Jew; neither circumcision, in appearance in the flesh:
{2:29} But he in concealment, a Jew; and circumcision of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose approbation not of man, but of God.
{3:1} What then the superiority of the Jew or what the advantage of circumcision?
{3:2} Much according to every manner: for truly first were they trusted with the oracles of God.
{3:3} For what if some disbelieved? their unbelief will not leave inactive the faith of God.
{3:4} It may not be: and let God be true, and every man a liar; as has been written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, and mightest conquer in thy being judged.
{3:5} And if our injustice shall recommend the justice of God, what shall we say God not unjust bringing in anger? (I speak as man).
{3:6} It may not be: for how shall God judge the world.
{3:7} For if the truth of God in my lying abounded to his glory; why yet am I judged as sinful?
{3:8} And not, (as we are defamed, and some have declared us to say,) That we should do evil things, that good things might come: whose judgment is just.
{3:9} What advantage therefore have we? Not in any way: for we before accused both Jews and Greeks, all to be under sin.
{3:10} As has been written, That there is no just one, not one:
{3:11} There is none understanding, there is none seeking God.
{3:12} All have bent aside, together have they become unprofitable: there is none doing good, there is not even one.
{3:13} Their throat an opened tomb; with their tongues have they used deceit; the poison of asps under their lips:
{3:14} Whose mouth is full of cursing and harshness:
{3:15} Their feet active to pour out blood:
{3:16} Bruising and grievous toil in their ways:
{3:17} And the way of peace they knew not:
{3:18} The fear of God is not before their eyes.
{3:19} And we know that whatever says the law, it speaks to them in the law: that every mouth be shut, and all the world be culpable to God.
{3:20} Therefore from the works of the law shall no flesh be justified before him: for by the law the knowledge of sin.
{3:21} But now without law the justice of God has been made apparent, being testified by the law and by the prophets;
{3:22} And the justice of God by faith of Jesus Christ to all and upon all believing: for there is no distinction:
{3:23} For all have sinned, and failed of the glory of God;
{3:24} Being justified as a gift by his grace by the redemption which is in Christ Jesus:
{3:25} Whom God had set before a propitiatory by faith in his blood, for a manifestation of his justice by passing over of sins before existing, in the sufferance of God;
{3:26} For the manifestation of his justice now in time: for him to be just, and justifying him of the faith of Jesus.
{3:27} Where then boasting? It was excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.
{3:28} We reckon then man to be justified by faith without the works of the law.
{3:29} Or only the God of the Jews? and not also of the nations? Yes, also of the nations:
{3:30} Since one God, who will justify circumcision of faith, and uncircumcision by faith.
{3:31} Therefore shall we leave the law inactive by faith It may not be: but we should establish the law.
{4:1} What then shall we say Abraham our father to have found, according to the flesh?
{4:2} For if Abraham was justified by works, he has boasting; but not toward God.
{4:3} For what says the writing? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for justice.
{4:4} And to him working, the reward is not reckoned according to favor, but according to debt.
{4:5} And to him not working, and believing upon him justifying the impious, his faith is reckoned for justice.
{4:6} As also David speaks the happiness of the man, to whom God reckons justice without works,
{4:7} Happy they whose iniquities were remitted, and whose sins were covered.
{4:8} A happy man to whom the Lord should not reckon sin.
{4:9} This happiness then upon circumcision, or upon uncircumcision? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for justice.
{4:10} How then was it reckoned? to him being in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
{4:11} And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith which in uncircumcision: for him to be father of all believing through uncircumcision; for justice also to be reckoned to them:
{4:12} And father of circumcision to them not of circumcision only, but also to them, walking in order in the tracks of the uncircumcision, of the faith of our father Abraham.
{4:13} For not by the law, the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, for him to be heir of the world, but by the justice of faith.
{4:14} For if they of the law, heirs, faith was made void, and the promise left inactive:
{4:15} For the law works wrath: for where is no law, no transgression.
{4:16} Therefore of faith, that according to grace; the promise to be firm to all the seed; not to that of the law only, but also to that of the faith of Abraham; who is father of us all,
{4:17} (As it has been written, That have set thee father of many nations,) over against him who believed God, making alive the dead, and calling things not being as being.
{4:18} Who against hope believed upon hope, for him to become father of many nations, according to that said, So shall thy seed be.
{4:19} And not having been weak in faith, he observed not his own body already having been dead, being about a hundred years, and the death of Sarah's womb:
{4:20} And for the promise of God he was not separated by unbelief; but was strengthened in faith, having given glory to God;
{4:21} And made perfectly certain that, what was promised, he is able to do.
{4:22} And therefore it was reckoned to him for justice.
{4:23} And it was not written for him alone, that it was reckoned to him;
{4:24} But also for us, to whom it is about to be reckoned, to them believing upon him having raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
{4:25} Who was delivered up for our faults, and raised up for our justification.
{5:1} Justified therefore of faith we have peace with God by our Lord Jesus Christ:
{5:2} By whom also we have had access by faith into this grace in which we have stood, and we boast upon hope of the glory of God.
{5:3} And not only, but also we boast in affliction: knowing that affliction works perseverance;
{5:4} And perseverance, proof; and proof, hope.
{5:5} And hope shames not; for the love of God has been poured in our hearts by the Holy Spirit given us.
{5:6} For yet Christ, we being weak, Recording to the time died for the impious.
{5:7} For scarcely for the just will any one die: yet for the good perhaps some also would venture to die.
{5:8} And God recommends his own love to us, that we yet being sinful, Christ died for us.
{5:9} Much more then, justified now in his blood, we shall be saved by him from wrath.
{5:10} For if, being enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, reconciled, we shall be saved in his life.
{5:11} And not only, but also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.
{5:12} Therefore, as by one man sin came into the world, and by sin death; and so death passed upon all men, in that all have sinned:
{5:13} (For until the law sin was in the world: and sin is not charged, being no law.
{5:14} But death reigned from Adam to Moses, and upon them not having sinned upon the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is the type of him about to be.
{5:15} But not as the fall, so also the favor. For if for the fall of one many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift in grace, of one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.
{5:16} And not as by one having sinned, the gift: for truly the judgment of one to condemnation, but the favor of many falls to justification.
{5:17} For if by the fall of one, death reigned by one; much more they receiving the abundance of grace and the gift of justice in life shall reign by one, Jesus Christ.)
{5:18} Therefore as by the fall of one for all men to condemnation; so also by the justification of one for all men to justification of life.
{5:19} For as by one man's disobedience many were constituted sinful, so also by the obedience of one shall many be constituted just.
{5:20} And the law entered, that the fall might abound. And where sin abounded, grace superabounded:
{5:21} That as sin reigned in death, so grace might reign by justice to life eternal, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
{6:1} What then shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, that grace might abound.
{6:2} It may not be. We who died to sin, shall we yet live in it?
{6:3} Or know ye not, that as many of us as were immersed in Christ Jesus, we were immersed into his death?
{6:4} Therefore were we buried with him by immersion into death: that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so also we should walk in newness of life.
{6:5} For if grown together we have been in the likeness of his death, but also shall we be of the resurrection:
{6:6} Knowing this, that our old man was crucified together, that the body of sin might be left inactive, for us no more to serve sin.
{6:7} For he having died was justified from sin.
{6:8} And if we died with Christ, we believe we shall also live with him:
{6:9} Knowing that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more; death has no more power over him.
{6:10} For he who died, died to sin once: but he who lives, lives to God.
{6:11} So also ye reckon yourselves truly to be dead to sin, and living to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
{6:12} Therefore let not sin reign in your mortal body, to listen to it in its passions.
{6:13} Neither present ye your members weapons of injustice to sin: but present yourselves to God, as living from the dead, and your members weapons of justice to God.
{6:14} For sin shall not rule over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.
{6:15} What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace It may not be.
{6:16} Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves servants for obedience, ye are servants to whom ye listen; either of sin to death, or of obedience to justice?
{6:17} And grace to God, that ye were servants of sin, but ye listened from the heart to the type of teaching in which ye were delivered.
{6:18} And freed from sin, ye were subdued to justice.
{6:19} (I speak as man through the weakness of your flesh:) for as ye presented your members to uncleanness and iniquity; so now present ye your members servants to justice for consecration.
{6:20} For when ye were servants to sin, ye were free to justice.
{6:21} Therefore what fruit had ye then of what ye are now ashamed? for the end of these, death.
{6:22} And now freed from sin, and subdued to God, ye have your fruit to consecration, and the end life eternal.
{6:23} For the purchasing the provisions of sin, death; and the grace of God, life eternal in Christ Jesus our Lord.
{7:1} Know ye not brethren, (for I speak to them knowing law,) that law rules over man as much time as he lives?
{7:2} For a married woman is bound by the law to a living husband; and if the husband die, she is left inactive from the law of the husband.
{7:3} Wherefore, the husband living, she shall be called adulteress if she be to another man: but if the man die, she is free from the law; not to be an adulteress, being to another man.
{7:4} Therefore, my brethren, ye also were dead to the law by the body of Christ; for you not to be to another, but to him raised from the dead, that we bring forth fruit to God.
{7:5} For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins, those by the law, were energetic in our members to bring forth fruit to death.
{7:6} And now we were left inactive from the law, having died in what we were held; so that we serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.
{7:7} What then shall we say? The law sin? It may not be. But I knew not sin except by the law: for I knew not lust, if the law said not, Thou shalt not eagerly desire.
{7:8} And sin, having taken occasion by the command, wrought in me every lust. For without law sin dead.
{7:9} And I was living without law once: and the command having come, sin came back to life, and I died.
{7:10} And the command was found to me which for life, this for death.
{7:11} For sin having taken occasion by the command, deceived me completely, and by it killed me.
{7:12} Therefore truly the law holy, and the command holy, and just, and good.
{7:13} Was then good death to me? It may not be. But sin, that it might appear sin, by the good working death in me; that sin might be sinful to excess by the command.
{7:14} For we know that the law is spiritual: and I am fleshly, sold under sin.
{7:15} For what I work I know not: for what I would not, this I do; but what I hate, this I do.
{7:16} And if what I would not this I do, I consent to the law that it is good.
{7:17} And now I no more wish it, but sin dwelling in me.
{7:18} For I know that in me dwells no good, (that is, in my flesh:) for to will lies near me; but to work good I find not.
{7:19} For not what good I would, do I; but the evil I would not, this I do.
{7:20} And if what I would not, this I do, I no more work it, but sin dwelling in me.
{7:21} I find therefore a law to me, wishing to do good, that evil lies near me.
{7:22} For I rejoice in the law of God, according to the man within:
{7:23} And I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind, and taking me captive to the law of sin being in my members.
{7:24} I an oppressed man: who shall save me from the body of this death?
{7:25} I return thanks to God by Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore truly with the mind I serve the law of God; and with the flesh the law of sin.
{8:1} Therefore now no condemnation to them in Christ Jesus, walking not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
{8:2} For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus freed me from the law of sin and death.
{8:3} For the impossibility of the law, in that it was weak by the flesh, God having sent his own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
{8:4} That the justification of the law be filled up in us, not walking according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
{8:5} For they being according to the flesh mind things of the flesh; and they according to the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
{8:6} For the thought of the flesh, death; and the thought of the Spirit, life and peace.
{8:7} Wherefore the thought of the flesh enmity to God: for it is not subject to the law of God, for it cannot be.
{8:8} And they being in the flesh cannot please God.
{8:9} But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwell in you. And if any have not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.
{8:10} And if Christ in you, truly the body dead by sin; and the Spirit life by justice.
{8:11} And if the Spirit of him having raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he having raised up Christ from the dead will make alive also your mortal bodies by his Spirit dwelling in you.
{8:12} Therefore, brethren, we are not debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
{8:13} For if ye live according to the flesh, ye shall die: and if by the Spirit ye kill the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
{8:14} For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.
{8:15} For ye have not received the Spirit of servitude again for fear; but have received the Spirit of adoption as a son, in which we cry, Abba, Father.
{8:16} The Spirit itself testifies with our spirit, that we are children of God:
{8:17} And if children, also heirs; truly heirs of God, and coheirs of Christ; if indeed we suffer together, that we may be also glorified together.
{8:18} For I reckon that the sufferings of the time now not worthy of the glory about to be revealed in us.
{8:19} For the anxious expectation of the creation awaits the revelation of the sons of God.
{8:20} For the creation was subject to vanity, not voluntarily, but by him having subjected in hope,
{8:21} That also the creation itself be freed from servitude of corruption to the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
{8:22} For we know that all creation groans together and travails together until now.
{8:23} And not only, but also they having the first fruits of the Spirit, and we ourselves groan in ourselves, waiting for the adoption as a son, the redemption of our body.
{8:24} For by hope were we saved: but hope being seen is not hope: for what any one sees, why does he also hope?
{8:25} And if what we see not, we hope for, by patience we wait.
{8:26} And likewise also the Spirit takes hold together, and assists our weaknesses: for what we would pray for as we ought, we know not, but the Spirit itself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.
{8:27} And he searching hearts knows what the thought of the Spirit, for according to God he supplicates for the holy ones.
{8:28} And we know that to them loving God, all things work together for good, to them being called according to the setting up.
{8:29} For whom he before knew, he also before determined of the form of the image of his Son, for him to be first born in many brethren.
{8:30} And whom he before determined, these he also called: and whom he called, these he also justified: and whom he justified, these he also glorified.
{8:31} What then shall we say to these? if God with us, who against us?
{8:32} Who truly spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, and how not with him will he freely give us all?
{8:33} Who shall demand payment for the chosen of God? God justifying.
{8:34} Who, he condemning Christ having died, and rather also raised again, who is at the right hand of God, and who intercedes for us.
{8:35} Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? pressure, or perplexity, or expulsion, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
{8:36} As has been written, That for thy sake we are killed the whole day; we were reckoned as sheep for slaughter.
{8:37} But in all these we obtain a complete victory by him having loved us.
{8:38} For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor beginnings, nor powers, nor things having stood, nor things about to be,
{8:39} Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creation, shall be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
{9:1} I Speak truth in Christ, I lie not, my consciousness bearing witness to me in the Holy Spirit,
{9:2} That there is great grief to me and continued pain in my heart.
{9:3} For I myself was praying to be anathema from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
{9:4} Who are Israelites; whose the adoption as a son, and the glory, and covenants, and legislation, and divine worship, and solemn promises;
{9:5} Whose the fathers, and from whom Christ according to the flesh, who being God over all, praised forever. Amen.
{9:6} And not as that the word of God has fallen through. For not they all of Israel, they which of Israel:
{9:7} Neither that the seed of Abraham, are all children: but, In Isaac shall the seed be called to thee.
{9:8} That is, The children of the flesh, these not the children of God: but the children of the solemn promise are reckoned for seed.
{9:9} For this the word of solemn promise, According to this time will I come, and there shall be a son to Sarah.
{9:10} And not only; but also Rebecca, having coition of one, Isaac our father;
{9:11} (For not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that according to choice the purpose of God might remain, not of works, but of him calling;)
{9:12} It was said to her, That the greater shall serve the less.
{9:13} As has been written, Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated.
{9:14} What then shall we say is injustice with God? It may not be.
{9:15} I will commiserate whomsoever I commiserate, and I will have compassion upon whomsoever I have compassion.
{9:16} Surely then, not of him willing, nor of him running, but of God commiserating.
{9:17} For the writing says to Pharaoh, That for this same have I raised thee up, so that I might show in thee my power, and so that my name might be announced in all the earth.
{9:18} Surely then, whom he will he commiserates, and whom he will he hardens.
{9:19} Thou wilt then say to me, Why does he yet blame For who has withstood his will?
{9:20} Surely, O man, who art thou replying against God? Shall the formation say to him having formed, Why hast thou made me so.
{9:21} Or has not the potter power over the clay, of the same mixture truly to make one vessel for honour, and one for dishonour.
{9:22} And if God, willing anger to be shown, and his power to be made known, endured in much long suffering the vessels of anger put in proper order for destruction:
{9:23} And that he might make known the riches of his glory upon the vessels of mercy, which he before prepared for glory.
{9:24} Whom he also called us, not only from the Jews, but also of the nations?
{9:25} As also he says in Hosea, I will call not my people my people; and the not loved, loved.
{9:26} And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them, Ye not my people; there shall they be called the sons of the living God.
{9:27} And Esaias cries for Israel, If the number of the sons of Israel as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved:
{9:28} For finishing and cutting short the word in justice: for the Lord will make the word cut short upon the earth.
{9:29} And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us seed, as Sodom had we been, and as Gomorrha had we been likened.
{9:30} What then shall we say? That the nations, not following justice, overtook justice, and the justice of faith.
{9:31} And Israel following the law of justice, reached not the law of justice.
{9:32} Wherefore? Because not of faith, but as of the works of the law. For they stumbled at the stumblingstone;
{9:33} As has been written, Behold I set in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offence: and every one believing on him shall not be ashamed.
{10:1} Brethren, truly my heart's delight and prayer to God for Israel is for salvation.
{10:2} For I testify for them that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
{10:3} For not knowing the justice of God, and seeking to establish their own justice, they have not been subjected to the justice of God.
{10:4} For Christ the end of the law for justice to every one believing.
{10:5} For Moses writes the justice of the law, That the man having done these things shall live in them.
{10:6} And the justice of faith says thus, Thou shouldest not say in thy heart, Who shall go up to heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down:)
{10:7} Or, Who shall go down to the abyss? (that is, to bring up Christ from the dead.)
{10:8} But what does it say? The word is near thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we proclaim;
{10:9} For if thou confess in thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
{10:10} For with the heart is believed for justice: and with the mouth is confessed for salvation.
{10:11} For the writing says, Every one believing upon him shall not be ashamed.
{10:12} For no distinction is of the Jew and also of the Greek: for the same Lord of all being rich to all calling upon him.
{10:13} For every one whoever should call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
{10:14} How then shall they call upon whom they believed not? and how shall they believe whom they heard not? and how shall they hear without him proclaiming?
{10:15} And how shall they proclaim, except they be sent? as has been written, How beautiful the feet of them announcing good news, peace, of them announcing good things!
{10:16} But not all listened to the good news. For Esaias says, Lord, who believed our report?
{10:17} Therefore faith, from the report, and report by the word of God.
{10:18} But I say, Have they not heard? Surely, in all the earth went out their sound, and their words to the end of the habitable globe.
{10:19} But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses says, I will make you jealous of not a nation, and by a shortsighted nation will I anger you.
{10:20} And Esaias is very confident, and says, I was found of them not seeking me; I was manifested to them not asking for me.
{10:21} And to Israel he says, The whole day have I unfolded my hands to an unbelieving and contradicting people.
{11:1} I say then, Has God rejected his people It may not be. For I also am an Israelite, of Abraham's seed, of the tribe of Benjamin.
{11:2} God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Or know ye not in Elias, what says the writing? how he addresses God against Israel, saying,
{11:3} Lord, thy prophets have they killed, and dug down thine altars; and I alone was left, and they seek my soul.
{11:4} But what say to him the intimations of divine will I have left to myself seven thousand men, who bent not the knee to Baal.
{11:5} So then also in the time now has been a remnant according to the election of grace.
{11:6} And if to grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. And if of works, it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
{11:7} What then What Israel seeks for, this be attained not; but the selection attained, and the rest were hardened.
{11:8} (As has been written, God gave them the spirit of mortal pain, eyes not to see, and earn not to hear;) even to this day.
{11:9} And David says, Let their table be for a snare, and for booty, and for a stumblingblock, and for a retribution to them:
{11:10} Let their eyes be darkened not to see, and let them bend their back always.
{11:11} I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? It may not be: but by their fall salvation to the nations, to make them jealous.
{11:12} And if their fall the riches of the world, and their disaster the riches of the nations; how much more their fulness?
{11:13} (For I speak to you the nations, inasmuch as truly I am the sent of the nations, I highly value my service:
{11:14} If in some way I might make jealous my flesh, and I might save some of them.)
{11:15} For if their rejection the reconciliation of the world, what the reception, but life from the dead?
{11:16} And if the first fruit holy, also the mixture: and if the root holy, also the young shoots.
{11:17} And if certain of the young shoots were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in them, and wert a partaker of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
{11:18} Act not proudly to the young shoots. And if thou boastest, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
{11:19} Thou wilt say then, That the young shoots were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
{11:20} Well; for unbelief were they broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but do thou fear:
{11:21} For if God spared not the young shoots according to nature, how will he either spare thee.
{11:22} Behold then the goodness and severity of God: truly upon the fallen, severity; and upon thee, goodness, if thou continue in goodness: otherwise shalt thou also be cut off.
{11:23} And they also, if they continue not in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
{11:24} For if thou according to nature wert cut out of the wild olive tree, and against nature wert grafted into the cultivated olive tree: how much more these, according to nature, shall be grafted into their own olive tree.
{11:25} For I will not ye should not know, brethren, this mystery, lest ye be wise with yourselves; for hardness from part has been to Israel, till the filling up of the nations come in.
{11:26} And so all Israel shall be saved: as has been written, The Deliverer shall come out of Sion, and turn away profanation from Jacob.
{11:27} And this the covenant to them with me, when I take away their sins.
{11:28} Truly concerning the good news, enemies for you: and concerning the selection, beloved for the fathers.
{11:29} For the favors and calling of God not causing repentance.
{11:30} For as also ye, when ye were disobedient to God, but now ye have been commiserated by the unbelief of these:
{11:31} So they now also were disobedient, by your mercy that they also be commiserated.
{11:32} For God shut them all up together in unbelief, that he might commiserate all.
{11:33} O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! His judgments how unsearchable, and his ways not traced out!
{11:34} For who knew the mind of the Lord? or who was his counsel?
{11:35} Or who first gave to him, and it shall be given back to him?
{11:36} For of him, and by him, and to him, all things: to him the glory forever Amen.
{12:1} I Beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing to God, your reasonable service.
{12:2} And be ye not conformed to this life, but be transformed by the renovation of your mind, for you to prove what the good, and the pleasing, and the perfected will of God.
{12:3} For I say, by the race given me, to every one being with you, not to entertain a high opinion of one's self above what is fitting to think: but to think to be discreet, as God has divided the measure of faith to each.
{12:4} For as in one body we have many members, and all members have not the same action:
{12:5} So we, the many, are one body in Christ, and the members for one another.
{12:6} And having gifts different according to the grace given us, whether prophecy, according to the due proportion of faith;
{12:7} Whether service, in service: whether he teaching, in instruction;
{12:8} Whether he beseeching, in supplication: he imparting, in simplicity; he placed before, in earnestness; he compassionating, in cheerfulness.
{12:9} Love unfeigned. Hating evil; fastened to good.
{12:10} In brotherly love, being kindly affectioned to one another; in honour preceding one another.
{12:11} In study not slothful; boiling in the spirit; serving the Lord;
{12:12} Rejoicing in hope; holding out under pressure; persevering in prayer;
{12:13} Participating in the necessities of the holy ones; pursuing hospitality.
{12:14} Praise them driving you out: praise ye, and curse not.
{12:15} To rejoice with the rejoicing, and weep with the weeping.
{12:16} Thinking the same towards one another. Not thinking high things but being led by humble things. Be not wise with yourselves.
{12:17} Giving hack evil for evil to none. Providing good things before all men.
{12:18} If possible of you, living peaceably with all men.
{12:19} Avenging not yourselves, beloved, but give ye place to anger: for it has been written, Vengeance to me; I will repay, says the Lord.
{12:20} If therefore thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for doing this, thou shalt heap up coals of fire on his head.
{12:21} Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
{13:1} Let every soul be placed under the protecting powers. For there is no power except from God: and the powers being, were ordered by God.
{13:2} So he opposing the power, has resisted the arrangement of God: and they having resisted shall receive to themselves judgment.
{13:3} For rulers are not the terror of good works, but of evil. And wilt thou not fear the power do good, and thou shalt have approbation of it:
{13:4} For he is servant of God to thee for good. And if thou do evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword without order: for he is servant of God, avenging for anger to him doing evil.
{13:5} Wherefore necessity to be placed under, not only for anger, but also for consciousness.
{13:6} For this also pay ye taxes: for they are workmen of God, persevering in this same.
{13:7} Therefore restore debts to all; to whom tribute, tribute; to whom recompense, recompense; to whom fear, fear; to whom honour, honour.
{13:8} Owe ye nothing to none, except to love one another: for he loving another has completed the law.
{13:9} For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false testimony, Thou shalt not covet; and if any other command in this word it is summed up, in it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
{13:10} Love works no evil to the neighbor: love therefore the completion of the law.
{13:11} And this, knowing the time, that already the hour ye should be awakened out of sleep: for now our salvation nearer than when we believed.
{13:12} The night has advanced, and the day has drawn near: therefore let us lay down the works of darkness, and put on the weapons of light.
{13:13} As in the day, let us walk becomingly; not in revelries and drunkenness, not in coition and licentiousness, not in strife and envy.
{13:14} But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not consideration for the flesh, for the passions.
{14:1} Him being weak in faith receive ye, not to judgments of conversations.
{14:2} One truly believes to eat all things: and he being weak eats vegetables.
{14:3} Let not him eating despise him not eating: and let not him not eating judge him eating: for God has received him.
{14:4} Who art thou judging another's servant? to his own lord he stands or falls. And he shall be made to stand: for God is powerful to make him stand.
{14:5} For one truly judges day above day: and one judges every day. Let each one be perfectly certain in his own mind.
{14:6} He minding the day, minds to the Lord; and he not minding the day, to the Lord he minds not. He eating, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he not eating, to the Lord he eats not, and he gives thanks to God.
{14:7} For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.
{14:8} For whether we live, to the Lord we live: and whether we die, to the Lord we die: therefore whether we live, and whether we die, we are of the Lord.
{14:9} For, for this Christ also died, and also arose, and returned again to life, that he might also reign over the dead and the living.
{14:10} And why judgest thou thy brother? or why also despisest thou thy brother? for we shall all stand at the judgment seat of Christ.
{14:11} For it has been written, I live, says the Lord, for to me shall every knee bend, and every tongue acknowledge to God.
{14:12} So therefore shall each of us give word for himself to God.
{14:13} Then let us no more judge one another: but rather judge ye this, not to put a stumble or offence to thy brother.
{14:14} I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing common by itself; except to any one reckoning to be common, to that one it is common.
{14:15} And if by food thy brother is grieved, thou no more walkest by love. Not by thy food destroy him, for whom Christ died.
{14:16} Therefore let not your good be defamed.
{14:17} For the kingdom of God is not food and drink; but justice, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
{14:18} For he in these serving Christ, pleasing to God, and acceptable to men.
{14:19} So therefore, let us pursue the things of peace, and the things for the building up for one another.
{14:20} Not for sake of food destroy thou the work of God. Truly all things clean; but evil to the man eating by offence.
{14:21} Good not to eat flesh, nor drink wine, nor in what thy brother stumbles, or is offended, or is weak.
{14:22} Thou has faith; have to thyself before God. Happy he judging not himself in what he proves.
{14:23} And he being judged if he eat, has been condemned for not of faith; and everything not of faith is sin.
{15:1} And we the able ought to bear the weaknesses of the unable and not please ourselves.
{15:2} For let each of us please the neighbor for good to the building.
{15:3} For Christ also pleased not himself, but as has been written, The reproaches of them reproaching thee fell upon me.
{15:4} For whatever before was written before are for our instruction was before written that by patience and consolation able of the writings we might have hope.
{15:5} And may the God of patience and his consolation give you to mind the same in one another according to Christ Jesus:
{15:6} That unanimously in one mouth ye should glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
{15:7} Wherefore receive ye one another, as also Christ received us to the glory of God.
{15:8} And I say Jesus Christ has become the servant of circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises of the fathers:
{15:9} And the nations to glorify God for mercies; as has been written, For this will I acknowledge to thee in the nations; and I will play on, the harp to thy name.
{15:10} And again he says, Rejoice, ye nations, with his people.
{15:11} And again, Praise the Lord, all ye nations; and land him all ye people.
{15:12} And again Esaias says, The root shall be of Jesse, and he having risen to rule over the nations; upon him shall the nations hope.
{15:13} And may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, for you to abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.
{15:14} And I am persuaded my brethren, and I myself for you, that ye yourselves also are full of goodness, tilled with all knowledge, being able also to remind one another.
{15:15} And I wrote to you more boldly, brethren, from part as reminding you, by the grace given me by God,
{15:16} For me to be the, workman of Jesus Christ to the nations, offering in sacrifice the good news of God, that the bringing forward of the nations be acceptable, consecrated in the Holy Spirit.
{15:17} I have therefore boasting in Christ Jesus the things toward God.
{15:18} For I shall dare to speak nothing that Christ has not brought about by me, for the obedience of the nations, by word and by work,
{15:19} By power of signs and wonders, by power of the Spirit of God, so that I from Jerusalem, and round about even to Illyricum, have completed the good news of Christ.
{15:20} And so seeking the honour to announce the good news, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon a strange foundation:
{15:21} But as has been written, to whom it was not announced of him, they shall see: and they who have not heard shall understand.
{15:22} Wherefore also I was hindered in many things from coming to you.
{15:23} And now having no more place in these climes, and having an anxious desire to come to you from many years.
{15:24} Whenever I go into Spain, I will come to you, for I hope passing through to see you: and by you to be sent forward there, if first from part I might be filled with you.
{15:25} And now I go to Jerusalem serving the holy ones.
{15:26} For Macedonia and Achaia were contented a certain mutual participation be made for the poor of the holy ones in Jerusalem.
{15:27} For they were contented; and they are their debtors. For if the nations have participated in their spiritual things, they ought also to serve them in things pertaining to the flesh.
{15:28} Therefore having completed this, and sealed to them this fruit, I will come away by you to Spain.
{15:29} And I know that, coming to you, I shall come in the completion of the praise of the good news of Christ.
{15:30} And I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by love of the Spirit, to fight together with me in prayers for me to God;
{15:31} That I might be saved from the unbelieving in Judea; and that my service for Jerusalem be acceptable to the holy ones;
{15:32} That in joy I might come to you by the will of God, and rest with you.
{15:33} And the God of peace with you all. Amen.
{16:1} And I place with you Phebe our sister, being servant of the church in Cenchrea:
{16:2} That ye receive her in the Lord, worthy of the holy ones, and encourage her in whatever thing she have need of you: for she also has been the rule of many, and of myself.
{16:3} Embrace Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:
{16:4} Who for my soul have laid down their own necks: to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the nations.
{16:5} And the church in their house. Embrace my beloved Epenetus, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ.
{16:6} Embrace Mary, who wearied for us.
{16:7} Embrace Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are distinguished among the sent, who also have been in Christ before me.
{16:8} Embrace ye Amplias my beloved in the Lord.
{16:9} Embrace Urban, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
{16:10} Embrace Apelles acceptable in Christ. Embrace them of Aristobulus.
{16:11} Embrace Herodion my kinsman. Embrace them of Narcissus, them being in the Lord.
{16:12} Embrace Tryphen a and Tryphosa, wearied in the Lord. Embrace Persis the beloved, who was much wearied in the Lord.
{16:13} Embrace Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
{16:14} Embrace Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren with them.
{16:15} Embrace Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the holy ones with them.
{16:16} Embrace one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ embrace you.
{16:17} And I beseech you, brethren, to observe narrowly them having made divisions and scandals against the teaching which ye learned; and bend away from them.
{16:18} For such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by specious language and praise completely deceive the hearts of the innocent.
{16:19} For your obedience has come to all. Therefore I rejoice for you: and I wish you truly to be wise to good, and pure to evil.
{16:20} And the God of peace will rub together Satan under your feet swiftly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you.
{16:21} Timotheus my helper, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, embrace you.
{16:22} I Tertius embrace you, having written the epistle in the Lord.
{16:23} Gains my guest, and of the whole church, embraces you. Erastus steward of the city embraces you, and Quartus the brother.
{16:24} The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen.
{16:25} And to him being able to support you according to my good news, and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery kept silent from eternal times,
{16:26} And now made manifest, also by the prophetic writings according to the command of the eternal God, for the obedience of faith made known to all nations:
{16:27} To the only wise God, by Jesus Christ, to whom glory forever. Amen.
