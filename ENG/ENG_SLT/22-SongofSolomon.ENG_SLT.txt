{1:1} The song of songs which is to Solomon.
{1:2} He shall kiss me from the kisses of his mouth: for thy good breasts are above wine.
{1:3} To the odor of the good ointments thy name shall be poured forth an ointment; for this, the maidens loved thee.
{1:4} Draw me, we will run after thee: the king brought me to his chambers: we will exult and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy breasts above wine: the upright loved thee.
{1:5} I am black and beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
{1:6} Thou shalt not see me, I am black; the sun searched me: my mother's sons were angry with me; they set me to watch the vineyards; my vineyard I watched not for me.
{1:7} Announce to me, thou whom my soul loved, where thou wilt feed, where thou wilt lie down at noon: wherefore shall I be as he covered by the herds of thy companions.
{1:8} If thou shalt not know for thyself, O fair one among women, come forth for thyself at the heels of the flock, and feed thy kids by the shepherds tents.
{1:9} To my mares in Pharaoh's chariots I likened thee, O my neighbor.
{1:10} Thy cheeks were beautiful with with rows, thy neck with strings of pearls.
{1:11} We will make for thee rows of gold, with marks of silver.
{1:12} The king yet in his divan, my spikenard gave its odor.
{1:13} A bundle of myrrh my beloved to me; he shall lodge between my breasts.
{1:14} A cluster of cypress my beloved to me in the vineyards of the kids fountain.
{1:15} Behold thee fair, my friend; behold thee beautiful; thine eyes are doves'.
{1:16} Behold thee beautiful, my beloved, also pleasant: also our bed is green.
{1:17} The walls of our houses cedars, our carved ceilings, cypresses.
{2:1} I am the flower of the plain, the lily of the valleys.
{2:2} As the lily between thorns, so is my friend between the daughters.
{2:3} As the apple among the trees of the forest, so my beloved between the sons. In his shadow I delighted, and I sat down, and his fruit was sweet to my palate.
{2:4} He brought me to the house of wine, and his banner over me was love.
{2:5} Sustain me with cakes, and refresh me with apples, for I am pierced of love.
{2:6} His left hand is under my head, and his right shall embrace me.
{2:7} I adjured you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, if ye shall awake and if ye shall arouse love till he shall desire.
{2:8} The voice of my beloved I behold him coming leaping upon the mountains, springing upon the hills.
{2:9} My beloved is like to the roe or to the fawn of the hinds: behold him standing behind our wall looking forth from the windows, glancing from the lattices.
{2:10} My beloved answered and said to me, Rise up for thyself, my friend, my beautiful one, and go for thyself.
{2:11} For behold, the winter passed away, the rain glided away; it went for itself.
{2:12} The flowers were seen in the earth; the time of pruning came, and the voice of the turtle-dove was heard in our land.
{2:13} The fig tree ripened its unripe figs, and the vines are in blossom; they gave an odor. Rise up, my friend, my beautiful one, and go for thyself.
{2:14} My dove in the refuges of the rock, in the biding of the steep mountain: cause me to see thy form, cause me to hear thy voice; for thy voice is sweet and thy form becoming.
{2:15} Seize for us the foxes, the little foxes destroying the vineyards: and our vineyards are in blossom.
{2:16} My beloved to me, and I to him: he feeding among the lilies.
{2:17} Until the day shall breathe and the shadows fled away, turn, thou, it being likened to thee, my beloved, to the roe, or to the fawn of the hind upon the mountains of section.
{3:1} Upon my bed in the night I sought him whom my soul loved: I sought him, and I found him not.
{3:2} I will arise now, and I will go round about in the city; in the streets, and in the broad places I will seek him whom my soul loved. I sought him, and I found him not.
{3:3} They watching going about in the city, found me: Saw ye him that my soul loved?
{3:4} As a little I passed from them till I found him my soul loved: I held him fast, and I shall not let him go till I brought him into my mother's house, and to the chamber of her conceiving me.
{3:5} I adjured you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, if ye shall awake and if ye shall arouse love till he shall desire.
{3:6} Who is this coming up from the desert as columns of smoke of burning incense, of myrrh and frankincense from all the powder of the trader.
{3:7} Behold his bed of Solomon: sixty strong ones round about it from the strong ones of Israel.
{3:8} All of them holding the sword, being trained to war: each his sword upon his thigh from terror in the night.
{3:9} King Solomon made for himself a litter from the woods of Lebanon.
{3:10} Its pillars he made silver, its support gold, its seat reddish purple, its midst tesselated with love from the daughters of Jerusalem.
{3:11} Go forth, ye daughters of Zion, and look upon king Solomon; upon the crown his mother crowned to him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
{4:1} Behold thee beautiful, my friend, behold thee beautiful; thine eyes doves from behind to thy veil: thy hair as a herd of goats which lay down from mount Gilead.
{4:2} Thy teeth as a herd of the shorn which came up from the washing; all of them bearing twins, and none barren among them.
{4:3} As a scarlet thread thy lips, and thy speech becoming: as a piece of pomegranate, thy temples from behind thy veil.
{4:4} As the tower of David thy neck, built for the weapons; a thousand shields hung upon it, all shields of the powerful.
{4:5} Thy two breasts as two fawns, twins of the roe deer feeding among the lilies.
{4:6} Till the day shall breathe, and the shadows fled away, I will go for myself to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of Lebanon.
{4:7} All of thee beautiful, my friend, and no blemish in thee.
{4:8} Thou shalt come with me from Lebanon, O bride, with me from Lebanon: thou shalt go round about from the head of faith, from the head of Shenir and Hermon, from the dwellings of lions, from the mountains of panthers.
{4:9} Thou didst rob me of the heart, my sister, O bride; thou didst rob me of the heart with one of thine eyes, with one necklace of thy neck.
{4:10} How beautiful were thy breasts, my sister, O bride! how good were thy breasts above wine, and the odor of thine ointments above all spices.
{4:11} Thy lips will drop honey droppings, O bride: honey and milk under thy tongue, and the odor of thy garments as the odor of Lebanon.
{4:12} A garden shut up, my sister, O bride; a reservoir shut up, a fountain sealed.
{4:13} Thy sendings forth a park of pomegranates, with most precious fruits, cypresses with spikenards,
{4:14} Spikenard and saffron; the reed and cinnamon, with all the woods of Lebanon; myrrh and aloes, with all the heads of spices.
{4:15} A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters and flowings from Lebanon.
{4:16} Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south, blow upon my garden; its spices shall flow out. My beloved shall come to his garden, and he shall eat his most precious fruits.
{5:1} I Came to my garden, my sister, O spouse: I gathered my myrrh with my spices; I ate my droppings with my honey; I drank my wine with my milk: Eat, O friends; drink ye, and drink to the full, O beloved ones.
{5:2} I slept and my heart waked: the voice of my beloved knocks at the door; Open to me, my sister, my friend, my dove, my perfect one: my head was filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.
{5:3} I put off my tunic, and how shall I put it on? I washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
{5:4} My beloved sent his hand from the hole, and my bowels were disquieted for him.
{5:5} I arose to open to my beloved, and my hands dropped myrrh, and my fingers, myrrh overflowing upon the hands of the bolt.
{5:6} I opened to my beloved, and my beloved turned about, he passed away: my soul went forth in his speaking: I sought and I found him not; I called him and he answered me not.
{5:7} They watching going round about in the city, found me; they struck me, they wounded me: they watching the wall took away my veil from me.
{5:8} I adjured you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye shall find my beloved, what ye shall announce to him: I am pierced by love.
{5:9} What is thy beloved above the beloved, O beautiful one among women? What thy beloved above the beloved, that thou didst thus adjure us?
{5:10} My beloved is white and ruddy, bearing the standard of ten thousand.
{5:11} His head purified gold, his locks waving branches, black as a raven.
{5:12} His eyes as doves upon channels of waters washed with milk, sitting upon fulness.
{5:13} His cheeks as beds of spices, towers of aromatic herbs: his lips lilies, dropping overflowing myrrh.
{5:14} His hands rings of gold completed in Tarshish: his bowels wrought ivory covered over with sapphires.
{5:15} His legs bases of white marble, founded upon of pure gold: his aspect as Lebanon, choice as the cedars.
{5:16} His palate, sweetness: he is all loveliness. This my beloved, and this my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
{6:1} Where went thy beloved, O beautiful one among women? where turned away thy beloved, and we will seek him with thee.
{6:2} My beloved went down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
{6:3} I to my beloved, and my beloved to me: he feeding among the lilies.
{6:4} Thou art beautiful my friend, as delight; becoming as Jerusalem, a terror as those being furnished with banners.
{6:5} Turn away thine eyes from before me; they enlarged me: thy hair as a herd of goats which lay down from Gilead.
{6:6} Thy teeth as a herd of sheep which went up from the washing, all of them bearing twins, and none barren among them.
{6:7} As a piece of pomegranate thy temples from behind thy veil.
{6:8} They are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and maidens no number.
{6:9} She is one, my dove, my perfect one; she is one to her mother, she is the chosen to her bearing her. The daughters saw her and pronounced her happy; the queens and the concubines, and they will praise her.
{6:10} Who this looking forth as the morning, beautiful as the moon, clear as the sun, a terror as those being furnished with banners?
{6:11} I went down into the garden of nuts to look upon the greens of the valley, to see whether the vine was fruitful, whether the pomegranates blossomed.
{6:12} I knew not my soul set me the chariots of my willing people.
{6:13} Turn back, turn back, thou Shulamite; turn back, turn back, and we will look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As the stringed instrument of the camps.
{7:1} How beautiful were thy steps with shoes, O daughter of a noble! the circuits of thy thighs a necklace, the work of the hands of an artist.
{7:2} Thy navel a bowl of roundness, it will not want mixed wine; thy belly a heap of wheat enclosed with lilies.
{7:3} Thy two breasts as two fawns, twins of the roe-deer.
{7:4} Thy neck as a tower of ivory; thine eyes pools in Heshbon, by the gate of the daughter of many: thy nose as the tower of Lebanon viewing the face of Damascus.
{7:5} Thy head upon thee as Carmel, and the locks of thy head as purple; the King being bound in curls.
{7:6} How beautiful and how pleasant thou wert, O love, in delights!
{7:7} This thy height was like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters.
{7:8} I said, I will go up upon the palm tree, I will hold fast upon its branches: and now thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the odor of thy nose as apples.
{7:9} And thy palate as good wine going to my beloved for uprightness, causing the lips of the sleeping to flow softly.
{7:10} I to my beloved, and upon me his desire.
{7:11} Come, my beloved, we will go forth to the field; we will lodge in the villages.
{7:12} We will rise early to the vineyards; we will see if the vine was fruitful, the vine blossoms opened, the pomegranates blossomed: there will I give my beloved to thee.
{7:13} The mandrakes gave an odor, and upon our entrances all precious things, new also old, my beloved, I laid up for thee.
{8:1} Who will give thee as a brother to me, sucking the breasts of my mother? I shall find thee without, I shall kiss thee; also they shall not despise me.
{8:2} I will lead thee, I will bring thee to the house of my mother; thou wilt teach me: I will give thee to drink from spiced wine from the new wine of my pomegranate.
{8:3} His left hand under my head, and his right shall embrace me.
{8:4} I adjured you, O daughters of Jerusalem, why will ye awake, and why will ye rouse love till he shall desire?
{8:5} Who this coming up from the desert, leaning herself upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I aroused thee: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she bearing thee, brought forth.
{8:6} Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love was strong as death; jealousy hard as hades: its flames, flames of fire, flames of Jehovah.
{8:7} Many waters shall not be able to quench love, and rivers shall not overwhelm it: if a man shall give all the riches of his house for love, despising, they shall be despised for him.
{8:8} A little sister to us, and no breasts to her: what shall we do for our sister in the day it shall be spoken for her?
{8:9} If she be a wall, we will build upon her a fortress of silver: and if she is a door we will bind upon her a tablet of cedar.
{8:10} I am a wall, and my breasts as towers: then was I in his eyes as finding peace.
{8:11} A vineyard was to Solomon in the place of a multitude; he gave the vineyards to those watching; each shall bring in its fruit a thousand of silver.
{8:12} My vineyard to me before me: a thousand to thee, O Solomon, and two hundred to those watching its fruit.
{8:13} Thou sitting in the gardens, the companions attending to thy voice: cause thou me to hear.
{8:14} Flee, my beloved, and be it likened to thee to the roe or to the fawn of the hinds upon the mountains of spices.
