{1:2} And Ahaziah will fall through the lattice in his upper chamber which was in Shomeron, and he will be sick: and he will send messengers, and say to them, Go seek in Baal the fly god of Ekron, if I shall live from this disease.
{1:3} And the messenger of Jehovah spake to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to the meeting of the messengers of the king of Shomeron, and speak to them, Is it because there is no God in Israel ye go to seek in Baal the fly god of Ekron?
{1:4} And for this, thus said Jehovah, The bed where thou wentest up there, thou shalt not come down from it, but dying, thou shalt die, and Elijah will go.
{1:5} And the messengers will turn back to him, and he will say to them, Why this ye turned back?
{1:6} And they will say to him, A man came up to our meeting, and he will say to us, Go, turn back to the king who sent you, and speak to him, Thus said Jehovah, Is it because there is no God in Israel thou sentest to seek in Baal the fly god of Ekron? for this the bed where thou wentest up there, thou shalt not come down from it, for dying, thou shalt die.
{1:7} And he will speak to them, What the judgment of the man who came up to your meeting, and he will speak to you these words?
{1:8} And they will say to him, A man possessing hair, girded with a girdle of skin upon his loins. And he will say, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
{1:9} And he will send to him a chief of fifty and his fifty. And he will go Up to him; and behold, he sat upon the head of the mountain. And he will speak to him. Thou man of God, the king spake, Come down.
{1:10} And Elijah will answer and speak to the captain of fifty, If I a man of God, fire shall come down out of the heavens and consume thee and thy fifty. And fire will come down from the heavens and consume him and his fifty.
{1:11} And he will turn back and send to him another captain of fifty and his fifty. And he will answer and speak to him, O man of God, thus said the king, Come down quickly.
{1:12} And Elijah will answer and speak to them, If I a man of God, fire shall come down from the heavens and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God will come down from the heavens and consume him and his fifty.
{1:13} And he will turn back and send a captain of the third fifty and his fifty. And the captain of the third fifty will go up and come and bend upon his knees before Elijah, and make supplication to him, and speak to him, O man of God, shall my soul now be precious, and the soul of these fifty, thy servants, in thine eyes?
{1:14} Behold, fire will come down from heaven and consume the two first captains and their fifties: and now shall my soul be precious in thine eyes?
{1:15} And the messenger of Jehovah will speak to Elijah, Go down with him: thou shalt not be afraid of his face. And he will rise and go down with him to the king.
{1:16} And he will speak to him, Thus said Jehovah, Because thou didst send messengers to seek in Baal the fly god of Ekron, Is it because there is no God in Israel to seek in his word? for this, the bed where thou wentest up there, thou shalt not come down from it, for dying, thou shalt die.
{1:17} And he will die according to the word of Jehovah which Elijah spoke. And Jehoram will reign in his stead in the second year to Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; for there was no son to him.
{1:18} And the rest of the words of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Israel?
{2:1} And it will be in Jehovah bringing up Elijah in a tempest to the heavens, and Elijah went up, and Elisha, from Gilgal.
{2:2} And Elijah will say to Elisha, Sit now, here; for Jehovah sent me even to the house of God. And Elisha will say to him, Jehovah lives, and thy soul lives, if I shall forsake thee. And they will go down to the house of God.
{2:3} And the sons of the prophets that were in the house of God will come forth to Elisha and say to him, Knewest thou that this day Jehovah takes thy lord from above thy head? And he will say, I also knew; be silent.

{2:7} And fifty men from the sons of the prophets went, and they will stand from opposite from afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.
{2:8} And Elijah will take his wide cloak and roll together, and strike the waters, and they will be divided hence and thence, and they two will pass through into the desert.
{2:9} And it will be as they passed through and Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee before I shall be taken from thee. And Elisha will say, Now shall the mouth of two in thy spirit be to me.
{2:10} And he will say, Thou wert hard to ask: if thou shalt see me taken from thee, it shall be thus to thee; and if not, it shall not be.
{2:11} And it will be they went, going speaking, and behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire, and they will separate between them two; and Elijah will up in a tempest to the heavens.
{2:12} And Elisha saw, and he crying, My father, my father! the chariot of Israel and his horsemen! and he saw him no more: and he will lay hold upon his garments and rend them into two rents.
{2:13} And he will lift, up the wide cloak of Elijah which fell from above him, and he will turn back and stand by the lip of Jordan.
{2:14} And he will take the wide cloak of Elijah which fell from off him and strike the waters, and say, Where is Jehovah the God of Elijah, even he? And he will strike the waters and they will divide hence and thence, and Elisha will pass through.
{2:15} And the sons of the prophets who were opposite in Jericho will see, and they will say, The spirit of Elijah rested upon Elisha. And they will come to meet him, and they will worship to him to the earth.
{2:16} And they will say to him, Behold now, there is with thy servants fifty men, sons of strength: they shall go now and seek thy lord, lest the spirit of Jehovah lifted him up, and it will cast him upon one of the mountains or into one of the valleys. And he will say, Ye shall not send.
{2:17} And they will press upon him till he was ashamed, and he will say, Send. And they will send fifty men; and they will seek three days, and they found not.
{2:18} And they will turn back to him, and he sitting in Jericho; and he will say to them, Did I not say to you, Ye shall not send?
{2:19} And the men of the city will say to Elisha, Behold the situation of the city good, as my lord sees: and the waters evil and the land barren.
{2:20} And he will say, Take to me a new dish, and put salt there. And they will take to him.
{2:21} And he will go forth to the going forth of the waters, and he will cast salt there, and be will say, Thus said Jehovah, I healed these waters; there shall be no more from thence death and barren.

{2:25} And he will go from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he turned back to Shomeron.
{3:1} And Jehoram son of Ahab reigned over Israel in Shomeron in the eighteenth year to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he will reign twelve years.
{3:2} And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, but not as his father and; as his mother; and he will remove the statue of Baal which his father made.
{3:3} But in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, he adhered; he departed not from them.
{3:4} And Misha king of Moab was a shepherd, and he turned back to the king of Israel a hundred; thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams, with the fleece.
{3:5} And it wilt be as Ahab died; and the king of Moab will break with the king of Israel.
{3:6} And king Jehoram will go forth in that day out of Shomeron, and he will review all Israel.
{3:7} And he will go and send to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab broke with me; go with me against Moab to war. And he will say, I will go: as me, as thee; as my people as thy people; as my horses as thy horses.
{3:8} And he will say, Where the way we shall go up? And he will say, The way of the desert of Edom.
{3:9} And the king of Israel will go and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom and they will encompass a way seven days; and there was no water for the camp, and for tire cattle which:were at their feet.

{3:11} And Jehoshaphat will say, Is there not here a prophet to Jehovah, and we will seek Jehovah from him? And one of the servants of the king of Israel will answer and say, Here is Elisha, son of Shaphat, who poured water upon, the hands of Elijah.
{3:12} And Jehoshaphat will say the word of Jehovah is with him, and the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom will come down to him.
{3:13} And Elisha will say to the king of Israel, What to me; and to thee go to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel will say to him, Nay for Jehovah called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.

{3:15} And now take to me a player on an instrument And it was when the player played, and the hand of Jehovah will be upon him.
{3:16} And he will say, Thus said Jehovah, Make this torrent, pits, pit.
{3:17} For thus said Jehovah, Ye shall not see wind, and ye shall not see rain; and that torrent shall be full of water, and ye drunk, and your possessions, and your cattle.
{3:18} And: this was light in the eyes of Jehovah, and he gave Moab into your hand.
{3:19} And strike ye every fortified city and every chosen city, and every good tree ye shall cause it to fall, and all the fountains of water ye shall shut up, and every good part ye shall mar with stones.
{3:20} And it will be in the morning when the gift went up, and behold, water coming from the way of Edom, and the earth will be filled with waters.

{3:23} And they will say, This the blood of the sword; the kings were destroyed, and they will strike a man his neighbor: and now to the spoil, Moab.

{4:3} And he will say, Go ask for thyself vessels from without from all thine dwelling near; empty vessels; thou shalt not be little.
{4:4} And come in and shut the door after thee and after thy sons, and thou shalt pour into all these vessels, and the full thou shalt remove.
{4:5} And she will go from him and shut the door after her and after her sons, they bringing near to her, and she pouring out.

{4:9} And she will say to her husband, Behold now, I knew that he is a holy man of God, passing by us continually.
{4:10} Now we will make a little wall chamber and put for him there a bed and a table, and a throne and a candlestick; and being in his coming to us he will turn aside there.

{4:28} And she will say, Did I ask a son from my lord? said I not, Thou shalt not deceive me?
{4:29} And he will say to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins and take my prop in thy hand, and go: If thou shalt find a man, thou shalt not praise him; and if a man shall praise thee, thou shalt not answer him: and put my prop upon the face of the boy.
{4:30} And the mother of the boy will say, Jehovah lives and thy soul lives, I will not leave thee. And he will rise and go after her.
{4:31} And Gehazi passed over before them, and he will put the prop upon the face of the boy, and no voice and no attention. And he will turn back to meet him; and he will announce to him, saying, The boy awaked not.

{6:3} And one will say, Be content, now, and go with thy servants And he will say, I will go.
{6:4} And he will go with them; and they will come to Jordan, and they will cut woods.
{6:5} And one will be felling the beam, and the iron fell into the water: and he will cry out and say, Alas, my lord! and it was borrowed.
{6:6} And the man of God will say, Where fell it? And he will cause him to see the place. And he will cut down wood and cast there; and the iron will overflow.

{6:10} And the king of Israel will send to the place which the man of God said to him and warned of it, and he watched himself there, not once, and not twice.
{6:11} And the heart of the king of Aram will be agitated for this word; and he will call to his servants and say to them, Will ye not announce to me who is leading us astray to the king of Israel?
{6:12} And one of his servants will say, No, my lord the king; but Elisha the prophet, who is in Israel, will announce to the king of Israel the words which thou wilt speak in thy bed-chamber.
{6:13} And he will say, Go, and see where he is, and I will send and take him. And it will be announced to him, saying, Behold, in Dothan.

{6:16} And he will say, Thou shalt not fear: for the many which are with us are more than with them.
{6:17} And Elisha will pray, and say, Jehovah open now his eyes, and he shall see. And Jehovah will open the boy's eyes, and he will see: and behold, the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
{6:18} And they will come down to him, and Elisha will pray to Jehovah, and say, Strike now, this nation with blindness. And he will strike them with blindness, according to the word of Elisha.
{6:19} And Elisha will say to them, This not the way, and this not the city: go ye after me, and I will take you to the man whom ye will seek. And he will cause them to go to Shomeron.
{6:20} And it will be when they came to Shomeron, and Elisha will say to Jehovah, Open the eyes of these, and they shall see. And Jehovah will open their eyes, and they will see; and behold, in the midst of Shomeron.
{6:21} And the king of Israel will say to Elisha when he saw them, Shall I strike? shall I strike, my father?
{6:22} And he will say, Thou shalt not strike: whom thou tookest captive with thy sword and with thy bow; strikest thou? set bread and water before them, and they shall eat and drink and go to their lord.
{6:23} And he will purchase for them a great purchase: and they will eat and drink, and he will send them, and they will go to their lord. And the troops of Aram will add no more to come into the land of Israel.

{8:13} And Hamel will say, For what! thy servant, the dog, that he will do this great word? and Elisha will say, Jehovah caused me to see thee king over Aram.

{17:33} They were fearing Jehovah, and were serving their gods according to the judgment of the nations who carried them into exile from thence,
{17:34} Even to this day they are doing according to the former judgments: they not fearing Jehovah, and not doing according to their laws and according to their judgments and according to the instruction and according to the command which Jehovah commanded the sons of Jacob, whom he set his name Israel.
{17:35} And Jehovah cut out a covenant with them, and he commanded them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, and ye shall not worship to them, and ye shall not serve them, and ye shall not sacrifice to them.
{17:36} But Jehovah who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an extended arm, him shall ye fear, and to him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye sacrifice.
{17:37} And the laws and the judgments, and the instruction and command which he wrote for you, ye shall watch to do all the days; and ye shall not fear other gods.
{17:38} And the covenant which I cut out with you ye shall not forget; and ye shall not fear other gods.
{17:39} But Jehovah your God ye shall fear, and he shall deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.
{17:40} And they did not hearken, but! they were doing according to their former judgments.

{18:4} He removed the heights, and he brake in pieces the statues, and he cut off the image, and he beat down the serpent of brass which Moses made: for till those days the sons of Israel were burning incense to it and they called it brass.
{18:5} And he trusted in Jehovah the God of Israel; and after him was not like him among all the kings of Judah, and who were before him.
{18:6} And he will cleave upon Jehovah he turned not away from after him, and he will watch his commands which Jehovah commanded Moses.
{18:7} And Jehovah was with him: in all which he will go forth he will prosper; and he will rebel against the king of Assur, and not serve him.
{18:8} He struck the rovers even to Azzah, and her bounds from the tower of those watching to the fortified city.

{18:11} And the king of Assur will carry Israel into exile to Assur, and put them in Halah and Habor, the river of Gihon, and the cities of the Medes:
{18:12} Because they heard not to the voice of Jehovah their God, and they will pass by his covenant, all which Moses commanded, the servant of Jehovah, and they heard not and did not.
{18:13} And in the fourteenth year to Hezekiah, Senherib, king of Assur, came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and he will seize them.
{18:14} And Hezekiah king of Judah will send to the king of Assur to Lachish, saying, I sinned; turn back from me: what thou givest upon me I will bear. And the king of Assur will put upon Hezekiah three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold.
{18:15} And Hezekiah will give all the silver found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king's house.
{18:16} In that time Hezekiah broke off the doors of the temple of Jehovah, and the supporters which Hezekiah king of Judah overlaid, and he will give them to the king of Assur.
{18:17} And the king of Assur will send Tartan, Rab-Saris, and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah, with weighty strength to Jerusalem; and they will go up and come to Jerusalem: and they will go up and come and stand by the aqueduct of the highest pool in the highway of the field of the fuller.
{18:18} And they will call for the king, and there will go forth to them Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph reminding.
{18:19} And Rabshakeh will say to them, Say now to Hezekiah, Thus said the great king, the king of Assur, What this confidence in which thou trustedst?
{18:20} Thou saidst (but a word of the lips) Counsel and strength for war Now upon whom didst thou trust that thou rebelledst against me?
{18:21} Now behold, thou trustedst to thyself, upon the stay of this broken reed, upon Egypt, which a man shall lean upon it and it will go into his hand and bore it; thus Pharaoh king of Egypt to all trusting upon him.
{18:22} And if ye shall say to me, We trusted to Jehovah our God: is it not he of whom Hezekiah turned away his heights and his altars, and he will say to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
{18:23} And now become surety to my lord the king of Assur, and I will give to thee two thousand horses if thou shalt be able to give to thyself riders upon them.
{18:24} And how wilt thou turn back the face of one prefect of my lord's servants of the least, and wilt thou trust to thyself upon Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
{18:25} Now came I up without Jehovah upon this place to destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.
{18:26} And Eliakim son of Hilkiah, will say, and Shebna, and Joah, to Rabshakeh, Speak now to thy servants in Syriac; for we hear: and thou shalt not speak with us in Judaic in the ears of the people who are upon the wall.
{18:27} And Rabshakeh will say to them, To thy lord and to thee did my lord send me to speak these words? is it not to the men sitting upon the wall to eat their dung and to drink their piss with you?
{18:28} And Rabshakeh will stand and call with a great voice in Judaic, and speak and say, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assur:
{18:29} Thus said the king, Hezekiah shall not be lifted up to you: for he shall not be able to deliver you from my hand:
{18:30} And Hezekiah shall cause you to trust to Jehovah, saying, Delivering, Jehovah will deliver us, and this same city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assur.
{18:31} Ye shall not hear to Hezekiah: for thus said the king of Assur, Make me a gift, and come forth to me, and eat ye a man his vine and a man his fig tree, and drink ye a man water of his well,
{18:32} Till my coming and I took you to a land as your land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and honey; and live ye, and ye shall not die: and ye shall not hear to Hezekiah, for he will seduce you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us.
{18:33} Delivering, did the gods of the nations deliver each his hand out of the hand of the king of Assur?
{18:34} Where the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? for did they deliver Shomemn out of my hand?
{18:35} Who of all the gods of the lands who delivered their land out of my hand, that Jehovah shall deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
{18:36} And the people were silent and answered him not a word: for it was the command of the king, saying, Ye shall not answer.
{18:37} And there came Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph reminding, to Hezekiah, their garments rent; and they will announce to him the words of Rabshakeh.
{19:1} And it will be when King Hezekiah heard and he will rend his garments and cover himself with sackcloth, and go into the house of Jehovah.
{19:2} And he will send Eliakim who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the old men of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amos.
{19:3} And they will say to him, Thus said Hezekiah, A day of straits and chastisement and reproach this day: for the sons came to the breaking forth, and no strength to her bringing forth.
{19:4} Perhaps Jehovah thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh which the king of Assur his lord sent him to reproach the living God; and he will decide upon the words which Jehovah thy God beard: and lift thou up a prayer for the remnant being found.
{19:5} And the servants of the king Hezekiah will come to Isaiah.
{19:6} And Isaiah will say to them, Thus shall ye say to your lord, Thus said Jehovah, Thou shalt not be afraid from before the words which thou heardest with which the boys of the king of Assur reviled me.
{19:7} Behold me giving upon him a spirit, and he heard a hearing, and he turned back to his land; and I caused him to fall by the sword in his land.
{19:8} And Rabshakeh will turn back and find the king of Assur warring against Libnah: for he heard that he removed from Lachish.
{19:9} And he will hear Tirhakah king of Cush, saying, Behold, he came forth to war with thee: and he will turn back and send messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
{19:10} Thus shall ye say to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Thy God will not lift thee up whom thou trustest in him, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assur.
{19:11} Behold, thou heardest what the kings of Assur did to all lands to destroy them: and shalt thou be delivered?
{19:12} Did the gods of the nations deliver them which my fathers destroyed Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden who were in Thelasar?
{19:13} Where the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king to the city of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivah?
{19:14} And Hezekiah will receive the letters from the hand of the messengers, and read them: and he will go up to the house of Jehovah, and Hezekiah will spread it out before Jehovah.
{19:15} And Hezekiah will pray before Jehovah, and say, O Jehovah God of Israel, dwelling upon the cherubim; thou God himself alone to all the kingdoms of the earth; thou madest the heavens and the earth.
{19:16} O Jehovah, incline thine ear and hear; O Jehovah open thine eyes and see: and hear the words of Senherib, which sent him to reproach the living God.
{19:17} Indeed, O Jehovah, the kings of Assur laid waste the nations and their land.
{19:18} And they gave their gods into fire, for they were not gods, but the work of the hands of man, wood and stone: and they will destroy them.
{19:19} And now, O Jehovah our God, save us now out of his hand, and all the kingdoms of the earth shall know that thou Jehovah art God alone.
{19:20} And Isaiah son of Amos will send to Hezekiah, saying, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, What thou hast prayed to me against Senherib king of Assur, I heard.
{19:21} This the word which Jehovah spake concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion despised, she derided thee; after thee the daughter of Jerusalem shook her head.
{19:22} Whom didst thou reproach and revile? and against whom didst thou lift up the voice, and thou wilt lift up thine eyes on high against the holy one of Israel?
{19:23} By the hand of thy messengers thou didst reproach Jehovah, and thou wilt say, With the chariot of my horseman I came up upon the height of the mountains of the sides of Lebanon, and I said, I will cut off the height of the cedars and the chosen of its cypresses: and I will go in to the lodging-place of the extremity of the forest of its Carmel.
{19:24} I dug and drank the waters of strangers, and I will dry up with the sole of my foot all the rivers of the fortress.
{19:25} Didst thou not hear from remoteness I made it from days before and I formed it? and now I brought it in, and thou wilt be to set fortified cities for desolate ruins.
{19:26} And the inhabitants were short of hand, they were terrified and they were ashamed; they were the grass of the field and the green herbage, and the grass of the roofs, and blasted before it rose up.
{19:27} And thy sitting and thy going out and thy coming in I knew, and thy wrath against me.
{19:28} Because thy wrath against me, and thine arrogance came up into mine ears, and I put my hook in thy nose and my bit into thy lips, and I turned thee back in the way which thou camest in it.
{19:29} And this the sign to thee, to eat this year things growing spontaneously, and in the second year, things springing up, and the third year, sow ye and reap, and plant vineyards and eat their fruits.
{19:30} And the escaping of the house of Judah being left shall add a root downward, and make fruit above.
{19:31} For from Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and an escaping from mount Zion: the zeal of Jehovah will do this.
{19:32} Therefore, thus said Jehovah to the king of Assur, He shall not come into this city, and he shall not shoot an arrow there, and a shield shall not come before it, and he shall not cast a mound against it.
{19:33} In the way in which be shall come in it he shall turn back, and to this city he shall not come in, says Jehovah.
{19:34} And I protected this city, to save it for my sake and for sake of David my servant.
{19:35} And it will be in that night the messenger of Jehovah will strike in the camp of Assur, a hundred eighty and five thousand; and they will rise early in the morning, and behold, all of them dead corpses.
{19:36} And Senherib king of Assur will turn away and go and turn back and dwell in Nineveh.
{19:37} And he will be worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, and Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword: and they escaped to the land of Ararat: and Esarhaddon his son will reign in his stead.
{20:1} In those days Hezekiah was sick to death; and Isaiah son of Amos the prophet will come in to him, and he will say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Command to thy house, for thou art dying, and thou shalt not live.
{20:2} And he will turn his face to the wall and pray, saying,
{20:3} O Jehovah, remember now how I went before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and I did the good in thine eyes. And Hezekiah will weep a great weeping.
{20:4} And it will be Isaiah went not forth to the city of the middle, and the word of Jehovah was to him, saying,
{20:5} Turn back and say to Hezekiah the leader of my people, Thus said Jehovah, God of David thy father, I heard thy prayer, I saw thy tears: behold me healing thee: in the third day thou shalt go up to the house of Jehovah.
{20:6} And I added to thy days fifteen years; and from the hand of the king of Assur I will deliver thee and this city; and I protected this city for my sake, and for sake of David my servant.
{20:7} And Isaiah will say, Take a round mass of figs. And they will take and put upon the burning sore, and he will live.
{20:8} And Hezekiah will say to Isaiah, What the sign that Jehovah will heal me, and I went up in the third day to the house of Jehovah?
{20:9} And Isaiah will say, This the sign to thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do the word which he spake: the shadow going ten steps, or shall it turn back ten steps?
{20:10} And Hezekiah will say, A light thing to the shadow to bow ten steps: nay, for the shadow shall turn backwards ten steps.
{20:11} And Isaiah the prophet will call to Jehovah, and he will turn back the shadow in the steps which went down, in the steps of Ahaz, backwards ten degrees.
{20:12} In that time Berodach-Baladan son of Baladan, king of Babel, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah was sick.
{20:13} And Hezekiah will hear to them, and caused them to see all the house of his spices, the silver and the gold, and the spices and the good oil, and all the house of his vessels, and all which was found in his treasures: and there was not a word which Hezekiah caused them not to see in his house, and in all his dominion.
{20:14} And Isaiah the prophet will come to king Hezekiah and say to him, What said these men? and from whence will they come to thee? and Hezekiah will say to him, From a land far off came they, from Babel.
{20:15} And he will say, What saw they in thy house? And Hezekiah will say, All which is in the house they saw; there was not a word which I caused them not to see in my treasures.
{20:16} And Isaiah will say to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah.
{20:17} Behold, the days coming, and there was lifted up all which was in thy house, and what thy fathers treasured up, even to this day, to Babel: not a word shall be left, said Jehovah.
{20:18} And from thy sons which shall go forth from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall be taken; and they were eunuchs in the temple of the king of Babel.
{20:19} And Hezekiah will say to Isaiah, Good the word of Jehovah which thou spakest And he will say, Shall not peace and truth be in my days?
{20:20} And the rest of the words of Hezekiah, and all his powers, and how he made the pool and the aqueduct, and he will bring waters to the city, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?
{20:21} And Hezekiah will lie down with his fathers, and Manasseh his son will reign in his stead.
{21:1} Manasseh the son of twelve years in his reigning, and fifty and five years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Hephzibah.
{21:2} And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to the abominations of the nations which Jehovah dispossessed from the face of the sons of Israel.
{21:3} And he will turn back and build the heights which Hezekiah his father destroyed; and he will raise up altars to Baal, and make a statue as did Ahab king of Israel; and he will worship to all the army of the heavens, and serve them.
{21:4} And he built altars in the house of Jehovah where Jehovah said, In Jerusalem I will put my name.
{21:5} And he will build altars to all the army of the heavens in the two enclosures of the house of Jehovah.
{21:6} And he caused his sons to pass through in fire, and he practiced magic, and took auguries, and made necromancy and a wizard spirit: he multiplied to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah to irritate.
{21:7} And he will set up a carved thing of the image which he made in the house, of which Jehovah said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house and in Jerusalem which I chose from all the tribes of Israel, I will set my name forever:
{21:8} And I will not add to move the foot of Israel from the land which I gave to their fathers; only if they will watch to do according to all I commanded them, and for all the instructions which Moses my servant commanded them.
{21:9} But they heard not, and Manasseh will cause them to go astray to do evil more than the nations which Jehovah destroyed from the face of the sons of Israel.
{21:10} And Jehovah will speak by the hand of his servants the prophets, saying,
{21:11} Because Manasseh king of Judah did these abominations, doing evil above all which the Amorites did that were before him, and he will also cause Judah to sin with his blocks:
{21:12} For this, thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, Behold me bringing evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, which all hearing it, his two ears shall tingle.
{21:13} And I stretched over Jerusalem the cord of Shomeron, and the weight of the house of Ahab: and I wiped off Jerusalem as one will wipe dishes, wiping, and turning upon its face.
{21:14} And I thrust out the remainder of my inheritance, and I gave them into the hand of their enemies; and they were for plunder and for a prey to all their enemies.
{21:15} Because they did evil in mine eyes, and they will be irritating me from the day which their fathers came forth out of Egypt, and even to this day.
{21:16} And also Manasseh poured out innocent blood exceeding much, till he filled Jerusalem mouth to mouth; besides his sins which he caused Judah to sin to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
{21:17} And the rest of the words of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sins which he sinned, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?
{21:18} And Manasseh will lie down with his fathers, and will be buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzzah: and Amon his son will reign in his stead.
{21:19} The son of twenty and two years was Amon in his reigning, and two years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Meshullemeth, daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
{21:20} And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah as did Manasseh his father.
{21:21} And he will go in all the ways which his father went, and he will serve the blocks which his father served, and he will worship to them.
{21:22} And he will forsake Jehovah the God of his fathers, and he went not in the way of Jehovah.
{21:23} And the servants of Amon will conspire against him, and they will kill the king in his house.
{21:24} And the people of the land will strike all those conspiring against king Amon; and the people of the land will make Josiah his son king in his stead.
{21:25} And the rest of the words of Amon which he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?
{21:26} And he will be buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzzah; and Josiah his son will reign in his stead.
{22:1} The son of eight years was Josiah in his reigning, and thirty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Jedidah, daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.
{22:2} And he will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah, and go in all the way of David his father, and he turned not aside to the right or the left.
{22:3} And it will be in the eighteenth year to king Josiah, the king sent Shaphen son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the scribe of the house of Jehovah, saying,
{22:4} Go up to Hilkiah the great priest, and he shall complete the silver being brought to the house of Jehovah, which the watchers of the threshold gathered from the people.
{22:5} And they shall give it into the hand of those appointed in the house of Jehovah: and they shall give it to those doing the work which is in the house of Jehovah to strengthen the breach of the house.
{22:6} To the artificers, and to the builders and the wall builders, and to buy woods and stones hewn to strengthen the house.
{22:7} But the silver given into their hand will not be reckoned with them, for they do in faith.
{22:8} And Hilkiah the great priest will say to Shaphan the scribe, I found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah, and Hilkiah will give the book to Shaphan and he will read it.
{22:9} And Shaphan the scribe will come to the king, and he will turn the king back word, and he will say, Thy servants melted the silver found in the house, and they will give it into the hand of those doing the work being appointed in the house of Jehovah.
{22:10} And Shaphan the scribe will announce to the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest gave to me a book, and Shaphan will read it before the king.
{22:11} And it will be when the king heard the words of the book of the law, and he will rend his garments.
{22:12} And the king will command Hilkiah the priest and Ahikam son of Shaphan, and Achbor, son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah the king's servant, saying,
{22:13} Go ye, seek Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all Judah concerning the words of this book being found: for great the anger of Jehovah burning upon us because that our fathers heard not to the words of this book to do according to all written concerning us.
{22:14} And Hilkiah the priest went, and Ahikam and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, to Huldah the prophetess wife of Shallum, son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, watching the garments; (and she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second rank;) and they will speak to her.
{22:15} And she will say to them, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Say ye to the man who sent you to me.
{22:16} Thus said Jehovah, Behold me bringing evil to this place, and upon its inhabitants all the words of the book which the king of Judah read.
{22:17} Because they forsook me, and they will burn incense to other gods to irritate me in all the work of their hands; and my wrath burnt upon this place and it shall not be quenched.
{22:18} To the king of Judah sending you to seek Jehovah, thus shalt thou say to him, Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, The words which thou heardest;
{22:19} Because thy heart was tender and thou wilt be humble from before Jehovah in thy hearing what I spake against this place, and against its inhabitants to be for desolation, and for a curse, and thou wilt rend thy garments and weep before me; and I also heard, says Jehovah.
{22:20} For this, behold me gathering thee to thy fathers, and thou wert gathered to thy tomb in peace; and thine eyes shall not look upon all the evil which I bring upon this place. And they will turn back the king word.
{23:1} And the king will send and gather to him all the old men of Judah and Jerusalem.
{23:2} And the king will go up to the house of Jehovah and all the men of Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests and the prophets, and all the people to the small, and even to the great: and he will read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant found in the house of Jehovah.
{23:3} And the king will stand by the pillar, and he will cut out a covenant before Jehovah to go after Jehovah, and to watch his commands and his testimonies and his laws, with all the heart and with all the soul, and to raise up the words of this covenant written upon this book. And all the people will stand in the covenant.
{23:4} And the king will command Hilkiah the great priest and the priests of the second rank, and the watchers of the threshold to bring forth out of the temple of Jehovah all the vessels being made for Baal and for the image, and for all the army of the heavens: and they will burn them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and he lifted up their dust to the house of God.
{23:5} And he caused the obscurations to cease which the kings of Judah gave, and he will burn incense in the heights in the cities of Judah, and those being round about Jerusalem, and those burning incense to Baal, to the sun and to the moon and to the constellations and to all the army of the heavens.
{23:6} And he will bring forth the image from the house of Jehovah from without Jerusalem to the torrent Kidron, and he will burn it by the torrent Kidron, and he will beat small to dust and cast the dust upon the grave of the sons of the people.
{23:7} And he will break down the houses of the holy places, which were in the house of Jehovah, where the women wove there houses for the image.
{23:8} And he will bring all the priests out of the cities of Judah and defile the heights where the priests burnt incense there from the hill even to the Well of the Oath, and he brake down the heights of the gates which were at the door of the gate of Joshua chief of the city which were at the left of a man in the gate of the city.
{23:9} But the priests of the heights will not come up to the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but they ate the unleavened in the midst of their brethren.
{23:10} And he defiled Topheth in the valley of the sons of Hinnom, for a man not to cause his son and his daughter to pass through in fire to the king.
{23:11} And he will take away the horses which the kings of Judah gave to the sun at the going in of the house of Jehovah into the chamber the king gave the eunuch which was in the open portico, and he burnt the chariots of the sun in fire.
{23:12} And the altars which were upon the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz which the kings of Judah made, and the altars which Manasseh made in the two enclosures of the house of Jehovah, the king broke down, and he will break in pieces from thence, and cast their dust into the torrent Kidron.
{23:13} And the heights which were before Jerusalem which were from the right to the mount of destruction which Solomon king of Israel built to Ashtaroth the abomination of the Sidonians, and to Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and to Milcom the abomination of the sons of Ammon the king defiled.
{23:14} He brake in pieces the statues and he will cut off the images, and fill their places with bones of man.
{23:15} And also the altar which was in the house of God, the height which Jeroboam son of Nebat who caused Israel to sin, made, also that altar and height he broke down and he will burn the height, and he beat small to dust, and he burnt the image.
{23:16} And Josiah will turn and see the tombs which were there in the mount, and he will send and take the bones from the tombs and burn upon the altar, and he will defile it according to the word of Jehovah which the man of God called who called these words.
{23:17} And he will say, What this pillar which I see? And the man of the city will say to him, The tomb of the man of God who came from Judah, and he will call these words which thou didst upon the altar of the house of God.
{23:18} And he will say, Give rest to him; a man shall not move his bones; and they will let escape his bones and the bones of the prophet who came from Shomeron.
{23:19} And also all the houses of the heights which were in the cities of Shomeron which the kings of Israel made to irritate, Josiah turned away, and he will do to them according to all the doings which he did in the house of God.
{23:20} And he will sacrifice all the priests of the heights which were there upon the altars, and he will burn the bones of man upon them, and he will turn back to Jerusalem.
{23:21} And the king will command all the people, saying, Do the passover to Jehovah your God, according to the writing upon the book of this covenant.
{23:22} For there was not done according to this passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel and all the days of the kings of Israel, and the kings of Judah.
{23:23} But in the eighteenth year to king Josiah was done this passover to Jehovah in Jerusalem.
{23:24} And also the necromancers, and the wizards and the family gods, and the blocks, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, Josiah took away in order to set up the words of the law written upon the book which Hilkiah the priest found in the house of Jehovah.
{23:25} And like him was there not a king before him who turned back to Jehovah with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; and after him there arose not like him.
{23:26} But Jehovah turned not back from the burning of his great anger, his anger which kindled against Judah because of all the provocations with which Manasseh irritated him.
{23:27} And Jehovah will say, I will also turn away Judah from my face, as I turned away Israel, and I rejected this city which I chose, Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
{23:28} And the rest of the words of Josiah, and all which he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?
{23:29} In his days Pharaoh-Necho, king of Egypt, came up against the king of Assur, upon the river Phrath, and king Josiah will go up to his meeting, and he will kill him at Megiddo when he saw him.
{23:30} And his servants will cause him to ride dead from Megiddo, and bring him to Jerusalem and bury him in his tomb. And the people of the land will take Jehoahaz son of Josiah, and they will anoint him and make him king instead of his father.
{23:31} The son of twenty and three years was Jehoahaz in his reigning; and three months he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.
{23:32} And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah according to all which his fathers did.
{23:33} And Pharaoh-Necho will bind him in Riblah in the land of Hamath, in reigning in Jerusalem; and he will give a fine upon the land, a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
{23:34} And Pharaoh-Necho will make Eliakim son of Josiah, king, instead of Josiah his father, and he will turn his name to Jehoiakim, and he took Jehoahaz: and he will come to Egypt and die there.
{23:35} And the silver and the gold Jehoiakim gave to Pharaoh; but he estimated the land to give the silver at the mouth of Pharaoh; a man according to his estimation, he exacted the silver and the gold with the people of the land to give to Pharaoh-Necho.
{23:36} The son of twenty and five years was Jehoiakim in his reigning, and eleven years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Zebudah, daughter of Pedaiah of Ramah.
{23:37} And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah according to all which his fathers did.
