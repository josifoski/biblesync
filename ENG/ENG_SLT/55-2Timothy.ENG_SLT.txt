{1:1} Paul, the sent of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,
{1:2} To Timothy, dearly beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
{1:3} I have grace to God, whom I serve from the forefathers in pure consciousness, as I have continual remembrance concerning thee in my prayers night and day;
{1:4} Desiring earnestly to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
{1:5} Receiving the report of unfeigned faith in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.
{1:6} By which I remind thee of the cause to light up the favor of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.
{1:7} For God gave not to us the spirit of timidity; but of power, and love, and of soundness of mind.
{1:8} Therefore shouldest thou not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his imprisoned: but partake of afflictions with the good news according to the power of God;
{1:9} Who having saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, given us in Christ Jesus before eternal times,
{1:10} And now made manifest by the appearance of our Saviour Jesus Christ, having truly left death unemployed, and having brought life and immortality to light by the good news:
{1:11} To which I was set a herald, and sent, teacher of the nations.
{1:12} By which cause I also suffer these things: but I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and have been persuaded that he is able to watch my deposits to that day.
{1:13} Hold the model of sound words, which thou didst hear of me, in the faith and love which in Christ Jesus.
{1:14} Watch the good deposit by the Holy Spirit dwelling in us.
{1:15} Thou knowest this, that all they dwelling in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
{1:16} May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for many times he refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my perplexity:
{1:17} But, being in Rome, he sought me very diligently, and found.
{1:18} (May, the Lord give to him to find mercy of the Lord in that day:) and in how many things he served in Ephesus, thou knowest better.
{2:1} Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.
{2:2} And what thou hast heard from me by many witnesses, these things lay by for faithful men, who will be sufficient to teach others also.
{2:3} Thou therefore suffer ill treatment, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
{2:4} None making war is entangled with the affairs of life: that he may please him having enlisted him.
{2:5} And also if any contend for a prize, he is not crowned, except he contend for a prize lawfully.
{2:6} The farmer toiling must first participate in the fruits.
{2:7} Observe what I say; for may the Lord give to thee understanding in all things.
{2:8} Remember Jesus Christ raised from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news:
{2:9} In which I suffer ill treatment, to bonds, as an evil doer; but the word of God has not been bound.
{2:10} For this I endure all things for the chosen, that they also might attain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
{2:11} Faithful the word: For if we died together, we shall also live together:
{2:12} If we endure, we shall also reign together: if we deny, he will also deny us:
{2:13} If we believe not, he remains faithful: he cannot deny himself.
{2:14} Put these things in mind, calling to witness before the Lord not to wrangle for nothing useful, to the subversion of them hearing.
{2:15} Be earnest to present thyself acceptable to God, a worker without shame, dividing rightly the word of truth.
{2:16} And avoid profane, empty discourses: for they will proceed to more of profanation.
{2:17} And this word as a gangrene, will have an eating ulcer: of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus;
{2:18} Who concerning the truth missed their aim, saying the rising up has already been; and they subvert the faith of some.
{2:19} Truly the firm foundation of God has stood, having this seal, The Lord knows them being his. And, Let every one naming the name of Christ remove from iniquity.
{2:20} And in a great house there is not only gold and silver vessels, but also wood and earthen; and some truly for honour, and some for dishonour.
{2:21} If therefore any cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel for honour, consecrated, and useful for the master, prepared for every good work.
{2:22} And flee youthful, eager desires: and follow justice, faith, love, peace, with them calling upon the Lord from a pure heart.
{2:23} And silly and ignorant questions refuse, knowing that they produce strifes.
{2:24} And the servant of the Lord must not contend; but be gentle to all, giving instruction, enduring evil,
{2:25} In meekness instructing them being in a contrary state; lest perhaps God may give them repentance to the acknowledgment of the truth;
{2:26} That they may return to a state of sobriety from the snare of the devil, being taken alive by him at his will.
{3:1} And this know, that in the last days difficult times shall interpose.
{3:2} For men shall be self-lovers, lovers of money, boastful, proud, slandering, disobedient to parents, unthankful, wicked,
{3:3} Devoid of natural affection, not observing treaties, accusers, ungoverned, wild, not loving the good,
{3:4} Traitors, rash, haughty, devoted to pleasure more than loving God;
{3:5} Having a form of devotion, and having denied its power: and these renounce.
{3:6} For of these are they going into houses, and taking captive little women heaped up with sins, led away with various eager desires,
{3:7} Always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
{3:8} And as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so also these have withstood the truth: men corrupted in mind, not tried concerning the faith.
{3:9} But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest to all, as theirs also was.
{3:10} And thou hast closely followed my doctrine, mode of life, purpose, faith, long suffering, love, patience,
{3:11} Expulsions, sufferings, which were to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what expulsions I endured: and the Lord delivered me from all.
{3:12} And all wishing to live devotedly in Christ Jesus shall be driven out.
{3:13} And evil men and impostors shall proceed to worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
{3:14} And remain thou in what things thou hast learned and hast been convinced of, knowing of whom thou hast learned;
{3:15} And that from infancy thou hast known the holy letters, able to render thee wise to salvation by faith which in Christ Jesus.
{3:16} All writing divinely inspired, and profitable for doctrine, for refutation, for correction, for instruction in justice:
{3:17} That the man of God might be perfect, finished for every good work.
{4:1} I call to witness before God there fore, and the Lord Jesus Christ, being about to judge the living and the dead according to his appearance and his kingdom;
{4:2} Proclaim the word; keep fixed seasonably, and unseasonably; refute, censure, beseech, in all longsuffering and teaching.
{4:3} For the time will be when they will not hear sound doctrine; but according to their own eager desires they will heap up to themselves teachers, feeling itchings for a report;
{4:4} And truly from the truth will they turn away the hearing, and be turned aside to fictions.
{4:5} And thou be sober in all things, suffer ill treatment, do the work of the bearer of good news, render thy service perfectly certain.
{4:6} For I am already poured out, and the time of my deliverance has been fixed.
{4:7} I have contended earnestly the good contest, I have completed the course, I have kept the faith:
{4:8} As to the rest, the crown of justice is laid up for me, which the Lord will assign to me in that day, the just judge: and not only to me, but also to all them having loved his appearance.
{4:9} Be earnest to come to me quickly.
{4:10} For Demas has forsaken me, having loved the time now, and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
{4:11} Luke alone is with me. Having taken Mark, bring with thyself: for he is useful for the service.
{4:12} And Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.
{4:13} The cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, coming, bring, and the books, chiefly the parchments.
{4:14} Alexander the coppersmith showed me much evil: (may the Lord give back to him according to his works:)
{4:15} Whom watch thou also; for he greatly withstood our words.
{4:16} In my first defence none was present with me, but all forsook me; (may it not be reckoned to them.)
{4:17} But the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the promulgation might be rendered perfectly certain, and all the nations might hear: and I was delivered out of the lion's mouth.
{4:18} And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and save for his heavenly kingdom: to whom the glory for the times of times. Amen.
{4:19} Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
{4:20} Erastus remained in Corinth: and Trophimus I left in Miletum sick.
{4:21} Be earnest to come before winter Eubulus greets thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
{4:22} The Lord Jesus Christ with thy Spirit. Grace with you. Amen.
