{1:1} Paul, sent of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy the brother,
{1:2} To the holy among the Colossians, and the faithful brethren in Christ: Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
{1:3} We return thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
{1:4} Having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and love to all the holy,
{1:5} By the hope laid up for you in the heavens, which ye heard before in the word of the truth of the good news;
{1:6} Being present to you as also in all the world; and is bearing fruit, as also in you, from the day which ye heard and knew the grace of God in truth:
{1:7} As also ye learned from Epaphras our beloved fellowservant, who is a faithful servant of Christ for you;
{1:8} He also having manifested to us your love in the Spirit.
{1:9} For this also we, from the day which we heard, ceased not praying for you, and asking that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
{1:10} For you to walk worthy of the Lord in all pleasing behavior, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
{1:11} In all power being able according to the strength of his glory, in all patience and longsuffering with joy.
{1:12} Returning thanks to the Father, having rendered us fitting for the portion of the lot of the holy in light:
{1:13} Who saved us from the power of darkness, and transferred into the kingdom of the Son of his love:
{1:14} In whom we have redemption by his blood, the remission of sins:
{1:15} Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation:
{1:16} For by him were all things created, things in the heavens, and things upon earth, things visible and invisible, whether thrones, whether dominions, whether beginnings, whether authorities: all were created by him, and for him:
{1:17} And he is before all, and all things have been established by him.
{1:18} And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that he might be the first in all.
{1:19} For in him was he pleased that all fulness should dwell:
{1:20} And by him to reconcile all things anew to himself; having made peace by the blood of his cross, by him, whether things upon earth, whether things in the heavens.
{1:21} And you, once being alienated and enemies in mind by evil works, and now has he reconciled.
{1:22} In the body of his flesh by death, to present you holy, and blameless, and irreproachable before him:
{1:23} If indeed ye remain in the faith, founded and firmly fixed, and not moved aside from the hope of the good news, which ye heard, being proclaimed in all creation under heaven; of which I Paul was a servant;
{1:24} Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill again the necessities of the pressures of Christ in my flesh for his body, which is the church.
{1:25} Of which I was a servant, according to the stewardship of God, given to me for you, to complete the word of God;
{1:26} The mystery hid from times immemorial, and from generations, and now has been manifested to his holy ones:
{1:27} To whom God would make known what the riches of the glory of this mystery in the nations; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:
{1:28} Whom we announce, reminding every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfected in Christ Jesus:
{1:29} For which also I am wearied, struggling according to his operation, working in me in power.
{2:1} For I wish you to know how great contest I have for you, and them in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
{2:2} That their hearts might be comforted, being joined together in love, and to all the riches of the complete certainty of the understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and the Father, and of Christ;
{2:3} In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
{2:4} And this I say, lest any mislead you with persuasive arguments.
{2:5} For if also I am away in the flesh but in the Spirit am I with you, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the firmness of your faith in Christ.
{2:6} Therefore as ye received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in him:
{2:7} Being rooted and built up in him, and rendered firm in the faith, as ye were taught, abounding in it with gratitude.
{2:8} See ye lest any be carrying you off by philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.
{2:9} For in him dwells all the completion of divinity bodily.
{2:10} And ye are completed in him, who is the head of all beginning and power:
{2:11} In whom also were ye circumcised with the circumcision not made by hands, in the putting off the body of the sins of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ;
{2:12} Buried together with him in immersion, in which also were ye risen together by the faith of the operation of God, having raised him from the dead.
{2:13} And you, being dead in faults and uncircumcision of the flesh, he made alive together with him, having propitiated to you all faults;
{2:14} Having wiped out the handwriting against us in enactments, which was opposed to us, and he has taken it from the midst, having nailed it to his cross.
{2:15} Having stripped off beginnings and powers, he made an example in freedom of speech, having led them in triumph in it.
{2:16} Therefore let not any judge you in food, or in drink, or in turn of festival, or of the new moon, or of sabbaths:
{2:17} Which are a shadow of things about to be; and the body of Christ.
{2:18} Let none condemn you being willing in humility and religious worship of angels, going into what he has not seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh,
{2:19} And not having power over the Head, from whom all the body, by all the senses of touch and connections furnished and joined together, increases with the increase of God.
{2:20} If therefore ye died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as living in the world, do ye dogmatize,
{2:21} (Touch not; neither taste; neither shouldest thou handle;
{2:22} Which are all for corruption in the using;) according to the commands and doctrines of men?
{2:23} Which things truly are having the word of wisdom in worship according to one's will, and humility, and prodigality of the body; not in any honour to satisfying the flesh.
{3:1} If therefore ye be risen with Christ, seek things above, where Christ is sitting on the right hand of God.
{3:2} Think of things above, and not upon those upon the earth.
{3:3} For ye died, and your life has been hid with Christ in God.
{3:4} When Christ shall be manifested, our life, then also ye with him shall be made manifest in glory.
{3:5} Therefore kill your members that are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry:
{3:6} For these comes the Wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience:
{3:7} In which also ye then walked, when ye lived in them.
{3:8} And now ye also put them all away; anger, wrath, badness, slander, shameful language out of your mouth.
{3:9} Lie not to one another, having put off the old man with big deeds;
{3:10} And having put on the new, being renewed in knowledge according to the image of him having created him:
{3:11} Where no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, servant, free: but Christ all things, and in all.
{3:12} Put on therefore, as the chosen of God, holy and beloved, bowels of compassions, kindnesses, humility, meekness, longsuffering;
{3:13} (Bearing one another, propitiating one another, if any have a complaint against any: as also Christ propitiated for you, so also ye.)
{3:14} And over all these, love, which is the bond of completion.
{3:15} And let the peace of God act as umpire in your hearts, to which also, ye were called in one body: and be grateful.
{3:16} Let the word of Christ dwell in, you richly; teaching and reminding one another in all wisdom, playing with harps, and songs, and spiritual odes, with grace singing in your hearts to the Lord.
{3:17} And all whatever you do in word and in work, all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.
{3:18} Women, place yourselves under your own husbands, as was permitted in the Lord.
{3:19} Men, love ye the wives, and be not embittered against them.
{3:20} Children, listen to parents in all things: for this is pleasing to the Lord.
{3:21} Fathers, irritate not your children, lest they be discouraged.
{3:22} Servants, listen ye in all things to lords according to the flesh; not in eyeservice as pleasing men; but in simplicity of heart, fearing God:
{3:23} And all, whatever ye do, work ye from the soul, as to the Lord, and not to men;
{3:24} Knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the reward of inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
{3:25} And he acting with injustice shall be taken care of for what he did unjustly: and there is no distinction of persons.
{4:1} Lords, render ye to servants Justice and equality; knowing that ye also have a Lord in the heavens.
{4:2} In prayer persevere, watching in it in gratitude.
{4:3} Praying together also for us, that God would open to us a door of the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, by which also I was bound;
{4:4} That I might manifest, as is fitting for me to speak.
{4:5} In wisdom walk toward them without, purchasing the time.
{4:6} Your word always in grace, Seasoned with salt, to know how it is fitting for you to answer one another.
{4:7} All things concerning me shall Tychicus make known to you, a dearly beloved brother, and a faithful servant and fellowservant in the Lord:
{4:8} Whom I sent to you for this same, that he might know the things concerning you, and comfort your hearts;
{4:9} With Onesimus, the faithful and dearly beloved brother, who is of you. They shall make known to you all the thing here.
{4:10} Aristarchus my fellowcaptive greets you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (for whom ye received commands: if he come to you, receive him;)
{4:11} And Jesus, called Justus, they being of the circumcision. These only fellow workers in the kingdom of God, which were a consolation to me.
{4:12} Epaphras, who of you, greets you, a servant of Christ, always contending for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfected and completed in all the will of God.
{4:13} For I bear testimony to him, that he has much zeal for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis.
{4:14} Luke, the dearly beloved physician, greets you, and Demas.
{4:15} Greet the brethren in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church in his house.
{4:16} And when the epistle shall be read among you, make that also it be read to the church in Laodicea; and that ye also read that from Laodicea.
{4:17} And say to Archippus, Look out for the service which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fill it.
{4:18} The greeting of Paul by my hand. Remember my bonds. Grace with you. Amen.
