{1:1} The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
{1:2} As it has been written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
{1:3} A voice of him crying in the desert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make his beaten paths straight.
{1:4} John was immersing in the desert, and proclaiming the immersion of repentance for the remission of sins.
{1:5} And the Judean country, and the Jerusalemites, were going out to him, and all were being immersed by him in the river Jordan, acknowledging their sins.
{1:6} And John was dressed in camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and eating locusts and wild honey;
{1:7} And he proclaimed, saying, The stronger than I comes after me, of whom I am not sufficient, having bent the head, to loose the strings of his shoes.
{1:8} I truly immersed you in water: but he shall immerse you with the Holy Spirit.
{1:9} And it was in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was immersed by John in Jordan.
{1:10} And quickly coming up from the water, he saw the heavens cleft asunder, and the Spirit, as a dove, descending upon him:
{1:11} And a voice was from the heavens; Thou art my dearly beloved Son, in whom I was contented.
{1:12} And directly the Spirit casts him, out into the desert.
{1:13} And he was there in the desert forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with wild beasts; and messengers were serving him.
{1:14} And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God,
{1:15} And saying, That the time has been completed, and the kingdom of God has drawn near: repent ye, and believe in the good news.
{1:16} And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting a large sweep-net in the sea: for they were fishermen.
{1:17} And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you to become fishermen of men.
{1:18} And quickly having left their nets, they followed him.
{1:19} And having moved forward a little from thence, he saw James of Zebedee, and John his brother, and they in the ship adjusting their nets.
{1:20} And quickly he called them: and having left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hirelings; they went after him.
{1:21} And they go into Capernaum; and quickly in the sabbaths, having entered into the synagogue, he taught.
{1:22} And they were struck with amazement at his teaching; for he was teaching them as having power, and not as the scribes?
{1:23} And there was in the synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, saying,
{1:24} Let alone; what to us and thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy of God.
{1:25} And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him.
{1:26} And the unclean spirit having torn him, and having cried with a great voice, came out of him.
{1:27} And all were amazed, so as to seek out with themselves, saying, What is this? what new teaching this? for with power also he commands the unclean spirits, and they listen to him.
{1:28} And a report of him went out quickly in the whole country about Galilee.
{1:29} And quickly, having come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
{1:30} And Simon's mother-in-law was laid down, affected with fever: and quickly they speak to him concerning her.
{1:31} And having come, he raised her, having held her hand; and the fever quickly left her, and she served them.
{1:32} And evening having come, when the sun set, they brought to him all being afflicted, and the possessed with a demon.
{1:33} And the whole city was gathered together at the door.
{1:34} And be cured many afflicted with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and permitted not the devils to speak, for they knew him.
{1:35} And early, having risen far in the night, he went out, and departed into a deserted place, and there prayed.
{1:36} And Simon, and they with him, followed him.
{1:37} And having found him, they say to him, That all seek thee.
{1:38} And he says to them, We should lead into the next small cities, that I might proclaim there also: for, for this have I come forth.
{1:39} And he was proclaiming in their synagogues in the whole of Galilee, and casting out demons.
{1:40} And a leprous one came to him, beseeching him, and supplicating him on his knees, and saying to him, That if thou wouldst, thou canst cleanse me.
{1:41} And Jesus, having felt compassion, having stretched out the hand, touched him, and says to him, I will: be thou cleansed.
{1:42} And he having spoken, quickly the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
{1:43} And having threatened him violently, quickly he cast him forth:
{1:44} And says to him, See thou say nothing to any one: but retire, shew thyself to the priest, and bring forward for thy cleansing what things Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
{1:45} And he, having gone forth, began to proclaim many things, and to spread the word a report, so that he could no more openly enter the city, but was without in desert places: and they come to him from every quarter.
{2:1} And again he went into Capernaum after the days; and it was heard that he is in the house.
{2:2} And quickly many were gathered together, so as no more to have room, neither at the door: and he spake the word to them.
{2:3} And they come to him, bringing a paralytic, lifted up by four.
{2:4} And not being able to draw near to him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was and having excavated, they let down his couch upon which the paralytic was laid.
{2:5} And Jesus having seen their faith, says to the paralytic, Child, thy sins have been remitted to thee.
{2:6} And certain of the scribes were sitting there, and discussing in their hearts,
{2:7} Why does this thus speak blasphemies? who can remit sins but the one God.
{2:8} And Jesus quickly having known that they discuss in themselves, says to them, Why discuss ye these things in your hearts.
{2:9} Why is it easier to say to the paralytic, Sins have been remitted to thee? or to say, Arise, lift up thy couch, and walk?
{2:10} And that ye might know that the Son of man has power to remit sins upon earth, (he says to the paralytic)
{2:11} I say to thee, Arise, and lift up thy couch, and retire to thy house.
{2:12} And he was quickly raised up; and having lifted up the couch, he went forth before all, so that all were affected in mind, and praised God, saying, That we never saw it thus.
{2:13} And he went out again by the sea; and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.
{2:14} And passing by, he saw Levi, him of Alpheus, sitting by the customhouse, and he says to him, Follow me. And having risen, he followed him.
{2:15} And it was in his reclining at table in his house, and many publicans and sinful reclined together with Jesus and his disciples: for they were many, and they followed him.
{2:16} And the scribes and Pharisees having seen him eating with publicans and sinful, said to his disciples, Why does he eat and drink with publicans and sinful?
{2:17} And Jesus having heard, says to them, They being strong have no need of a physician, but those being affected: I came not to call the just, but the sinful to repentance.
{2:18} And the disciples of John, and of the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John, and of the Pharisees fast, and the disciples to thee fast not?
{2:19} And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the nuptial chamber, in which the bridegroom is with them, fast? as much time as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
{2:20} And the days shall come when the bridegroom should he taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
{2:21} And none sews a piece of uncombed fragment upon an old garment; and lest its new filling up take away from the old, and the splitting be worse.
{2:22} And none puts new wine in old wine-skins: and lest the new wine rend the wine-skins, and the wine be poured out, and the wine-skins perish; but they put new wine in new wine-skins.
{2:23} And it was he passed by through the standing corn in the sabbaths: and his disciples began to make the way, picking out the ears of corn.
{2:24} And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they in the sabbaths what is not lawful.
{2:25} And he said to them, Did ye never read what David did, when he had need, and hungered, himself, and those with him?
{2:26} How he went into the house of God to Abiathar the chief priest, and ate the loaves of setting up, which is not lawful to eat but for priests, and gave to those being with him?
{2:27} And he said to them, The sabbath was for man, and not man for the sabbath:
{2:28} Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
{3:1} And he went again into the synagogue; and a man was there having the hand dried up.
{3:2} And they were observing him narrowly, if in the sabbaths he will heal him; that they might accuse him.
{3:3} And he says to the man having the hand dried up, Rise in the midst.
{3:4} And he says to them, Is it lawful in the sabbaths to do good, or to do evil? to save a soul, or to kill? And they were silent.
{3:5} And having looked round upon them with anger, grieved for the hardness of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
{3:6} And the Pharisees having come out, quickly with the Herodians were making counsel against him, that they might destroy him.
{3:7} And Jesus withdrew with, his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea,
{3:8} And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard what he did, came to him.
{3:9} And he said to his disciples, that a small vessel should remain for him, on account of the crowd, that they might not press him.
{3:10} For he cured many; so as to fall upon him that they might touch him, as many as had plagues.
{3:11} And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell before him, and cried, saying, That thou art the Son of God.
{3:12} And he censured them much, lest they should make him manifest.
{3:13} And he goes up to a mountain, and calls whom he would: and they came to him.
{3:14} And he made the twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to proclaim,
{3:15} And have power to cure diseases, and cast out demons:
{3:16} And he set to Simon the name Peter;
{3:17} And James, him of Zebedee, and John brother of James; and he set to them names Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:
{3:18} And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James him of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
{3:19} And Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up.
{3:20} And they came into the house; and again came the crowd together, so that they could not even eat bread.
{3:21} And they with him, having heard, came forth to take hold of him: for they said, That he is affected in mind.
{3:22} And the scribes, they having come down from Jerusalem, said, That he has Beelzeboul, and that by the ruler of demons he casts out demons.
{3:23} And having called them, in parables spake he to them, How can Satan cast out Satan.
{3:24} And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
{3:25} And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
{3:26} And if Satan rise up against himself, and has been divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.
{3:27} None can plunder the vessels of the strong, having entered his house, except he first bind the strong; then he will plunder his house.
{3:28} Truly I say to you, That all sins shall be remitted to the sons of men, and defamations whatever they defame:
{3:29} And whoever should defame against the Holy Spirit has no remission forever, but he is liable to the penalty of eternal condemnation.
{3:30} For they said, He has an unclean spirit.
{3:31} Then came his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, they sent to him, calling him.
{3:32} And the crowd sat about him, and they said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek thee.
{3:33} And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, and my brethren?
{3:34} And having looked round upon those sitting round about him, he says, Behold my mother and my brethren!
{3:35} For whoever should do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
{4:1} And again he began to teach by the sea: and a great crowd was gathered together to him, so that he, having gone into the ship, sat in the sea; and all the crowd was by the sea upon land.
{4:2} And he taught them in parables many things, and said to them in his teaching,
{4:3} Hear ye; behold, he sowing went out to sow:
{4:4} And it was in sowing some truly fell by the way, and the flying things of heaven came and ate it down.
{4:5} And other fell upon stony places, where it had not much earth; and quickly it sprang forth, for it had no deepness of earth:
{4:6} And the sun having risen, it was parched up; and because it had no root, it was dried up.
{4:7} And other fell in thorns, and the thorns came up, and choked it, and it gave no fruit.
{4:8} And other fell in good earth, and gave fruit coming up and increasing; and one brought thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.
{4:9} And he said to them, He having ears to hear, let him hear.
{4:10} And when he was alone, they about him with the twelve asked him of the parable.
{4:11} And he said to them, To you has it been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to those without, all are in parables:
{4:12} That seeing they might see, and not know; and hearing they might hear, and not understand; lest they turn back, and their sins be remitted to them.
{4:13} And he says to them, Know ye not this parable? and how will ye know all parables?
{4:14} He sowing sows the word.
{4:15} And these are they by the way, where the word is sown; and when they hear, quickly comes Satan, and takes away the word sown in their hearts.
{4:16} And these are likewise they sown upon stony places; who, when they hear, quickly with joy receive it;
{4:17} And have no root in themselves, but are temporary; then pressure having been or expulsion for the word, quickly are they scandalized.
{4:18} And these are they sown in thorns; these are they hearing the word.
{4:19} And the cares of this time, and the deceit of riches, and eager desires about remaining things, coming in, choke the word, and it is unfruitful.
{4:20} And these are they sown on good earth; who hear the word, and receive, and bear fruit, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.
{4:21} And he said to them, Much less the light comes that it be set under a bushel, or under a bed; that it be not set upon a candlestick.
{4:22} For not anything is hid, which should not be manifested; neither was concealed, but that it should come clear.
{4:23} Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.
{4:24} And he said to them, See ye how ye hear: with what measure ye measure, shall be measured to you: and to you hearing, shall be added.
{4:25} For whoever should have, to him shall be given: and whoever has not, also what he has shall be taken away from him.
{4:26} And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;
{4:27} And he sleep, and should rise night and day, and the seed should sprout, and be raised; how, he knows not.
{4:28} For the earth bears fruit spontaneously; first the grass, then the ear, then the full wheat in the ear.
{4:29} But when the fruit should yield, quickly he sends the sickle, for the harvest is brought forward.
{4:30} And he said, To what should we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable should we hold it forth?
{4:31} As a kernel of mustard, which, when it be sown in the earth, is smaller than all seeds upon the earth:
{4:32} And when it be sown, it comes up and is greater than all vegetables, and makes great young shoots; so that the flying things of heaven can encamp under its shadow.
{4:33} And with many such parables spake he the word to them, as they were able to hear.
{4:34} And without a parable spake he not to them: and apart, he solved all to his disciples.
{4:35} And he says to them in that day, being evening, Let us go beyond.
{4:36} And having let the crowd go, they receive him as he was in the ship. And there were also other small vessels with him.
{4:37} And there is a great hurricane of wind, and the waves struck against the ship, so that it was already filled.
{4:38} And he was upon the back part of the ship, sleeping upon a pillow: and they aroused him, and say to him, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?
{4:39} And having risen, he censured the wind, and said to the sea, Be silent, be constricted. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
{4:40} And he said to them, Why are ye so timorous? how have ye not faith?
{4:41} And they feared a great fear, and said to one another, Who is this, that also the wind and sea listen to him.
{5:1} And they went beyond the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes.
{5:2} And to him coming out of the ship, quickly a man met him from the monuments with an unclean spirit,
{5:3} Who had a dwelling among the monuments; and neither with chains could any one bind him:
{5:4} For he had been bound many times with fetters and chains, and the chains were torn asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: and none could tame him.
{5:5} And always, night and day, was he in the mountains, and among the monuments, crying, and mangling himself with stones.
{5:6} And having seen Jesus from afar, he ran and worshipped him.
{5:7} And having cried with a great voice, he said, What to me and thee, Jesus, O Son of God most high I adjure thee by God, that thou torture me not.
{5:8} For he said to him, Come forth out of the man, thou unclean spirit.
{5:9} And he asked him, What the name to thee? And he answered, saying, My name, Legion: for we are many.
{5:10} And he besought him much that he would not send them out of the country.
{5:11} And a great herd of swine was feeding there near the mountains.
{5:12} And all the demons besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we might enter into them.
{5:13} And quickly Jesus permitted them. And the evil spirits having come forth, entered into the swine: and the herd rushed through the precipice into the sea, (and they were about two thousand;) and they were choked in the sea.
{5:14} And those feeding the swine fled, and they announced in the city, and in the fields. And they came forth to see what is it that was done.
{5:15} And they come to Jesus, and they see him possessed with the demon, sitting down, and being clothed, and of sound mind: and they were afraid.
{5:16} And they having seen, recounted to them how it was to him possessed with the demon, and concerning the swine.
{5:17} And they began to beseech him to depart out of their bounds.
{5:18} And he having gone into the ship, he having been possessed with a demon besought him that he might be with him.
{5:19} And Jesus permitted him not; but he says to him, Retire to thy house, to thine own, and announce to them what things the Lord did to thee, and he pitied thee.
{5:20} And he went away, and began to proclaim in Decapolis what Jesus did to him: and all were wondering.
{5:21} And Jesus having passed over again in the ship on the other side, a great crowd was gathered together to him: and he was by the sea.
{5:22} And, behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue comes, Jairus by name; and having seen him, he fell at his feet,
{5:23} And he besought him much, saying, That my little daughter is at the last extremity: that, having come, thou Mightest put the hands upon her, so that she might be saved; and she shall live.
{5:24} And he went away with him; and a great crowd followed him, and they pressed him.
{5:25} And a certain woman, being in a flowing of blood twelve years,
{5:26} And having suffered many things by many physicians, and having expended all of her own, and not having been benefited, but having come rather to the worse,
{5:27} Having heard concerning Jesus, having come in the crowd behind, she touched his garment.
{5:28} For she said, That if I touch his garment, I shall be saved.
{5:29} And quickly the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she knew in the body that she is healed from the plague.
{5:30} And Jesus, having quickly known in himself the power having gone out of him, having turned round in the crowd, he said, Who has touched my garments?
{5:31} And his disciples said to him, Seest thou the crowd pressing thee, and sayest thou, Who has touched me?
{5:32} And he looked round about to see her having done this.
{5:33} And the woman, afraid and trembling, having known what bad been upon her, came and fell down before him, and spake all the truth to him.
{5:34} And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith has saved thee; retire in peace, and be whole from thy plague.
{5:35} He yet speaking, they come from the ruler of the synagogue, saying, That thy daughter is dead: why yet dost thou importune the Teacher?
{5:36} And Jesus having quickly heard the word spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe.
{5:37} And he permitted not any to follow him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
{5:38} And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sees an uproar, they weeping and wailing much.
{5:39} And having time in, he says to them, Why make ye an uproar, and weep? the young child is not dead, but sleeps.
{5:40} And they laughed at him. And he, having cast them all out, takes the father and mother of the young child, and those with him, and goes where the young child was lying.
{5:41} And having taken the hand of the young child, he says to her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Little girl, I say to thee, arise.
{5:42} And the little girl arose quickly, and walked; for she was of twelve years. And they were affected in mind with great amazement.
{5:43} And he charged them much that none should know this thing; and he spake to give her to eat.
{6:1} And he came out thence, and came to his native land; and his disciples follow him.
{6:2} And sabbath having come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing were struck with amazement, saying, Whence to this one these things? and what this wisdom given to him, that such powers are done by his hands?
{6:3} Is not this the carpenter, son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Jude, and Simon and are not his sisters here with us? And they were scandalized in him.
{6:4} And Jesus said to them, That a prophet Is not unhonoured, except in his native land, and in kinsmen, and in his house.
{6:5} And he could do no power there, except having laid his hands upon a few sick, he cured.
{6:6} And he wondered for their unbelief. And he went about the towns teaching.
{6:7} And he calls the twelve, and began to send them, two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;
{6:8} And enjoined them, that they take nothing for the way, except a rod only; no traveling-sack, no bread, no brass in the purse:
{6:9} But bound with sandals; and not clothed with two coats.
{6:10} And he said to them, Wherever ye come into a house, there remain ye even till ye should come forth thence.
{6:11} And as many as receive you not, nor hear you, going out thence, shake off the heap of dust under your feet for testimony to them. Truly I say to you, It shall be more supportable for the Sodomites or Gomorrhites in the day of judgment, than that city.
{6:12} And having gone out, they proclaimed that they repent.
{6:13} And they cast out many demons, and anointed many sick with oil, and they were cured.
{6:14} And king Herod heard his name; (for it was manifest:) and said, That John the Immerser was raised from the dead, and for this the powers were energetic in him.
{6:15} Others amid, That he is Elias. And others said, That he is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
{6:16} And Herod, having heard, said, That John whom I beheaded, this is he; he was raised from the dead.
{6:17} For this Herod, having sent, took John, and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife: for he married her.
{6:18} For John said to Herod, That it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.
{6:19} And Herodias had a grudge against him, and desired to kill him; and could not:
{6:20} For Herod feared John, knowing him a just and holy man, and he observed him: and having heard him, did many things, and heard him cheerfully.
{6:21} And a convenient day having come, when Herod in the festivities of his birthday made a supper to his leading persons, and to the captains of thousands, and to the first of Galilee;
{6:22} And the daughter of this Herodias, having come in, and danced, and pleased Herod and those reclining together at table, the king said to the little girl, Ask me whatever thou wishest, and I will give thee.
{6:23} And he swore to her, That whatever thou shouldest ask, I will give thee, even to half my kingdom.
{6:24} And she having come out, said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Immerser.
{6:25} And having come quickly with haste to the king, she asked, saying, I wish that thou wouldest give me by itself, upon a board, the head of John the Immerser.
{6:26} And the king having been sorely grieved on account of the oaths and those reclining at table together, wished not to refuse her.
{6:27} And quickly the king, having sent a scout, commanded his head to be brought:
{6:28} And he having departed, beheaded him in prison, and brought his head upon a board, and gave it to the little girl: and the little girl gave it to her mother.
{6:29} And his disciples, having heard, came and took up his corpse, and put it in a tomb.
{6:30} And the sent are gathered to Jesus, and announced to him all things, whatever they did, and whatever they taught.
{6:31} And he said to them, Come ye yourselves apart to a desert place, and rest a little: for many were coming and returning, and neither had they leisure to eat.
{6:32} And they departed to a desert place by ship apart.
{6:33} And the crowds saw them retiring, and many knew him, and they were running there on foot from all cities, and came before them, and came together to him.
{6:34} And Jesus, having come out, saw a great crowd, and felt compassion for them, for they were as sheep having not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
{6:35} And having been already much time, his disciples, having come to him, say, This is a desert place, and already the time much:
{6:36} Loose them, that having departed to the fields and towns round about, they might buy to themselves loaves: for they have nothing they might eat.
{6:37} And having answered, he said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they say to him, Having gone, should we buy loaves of two hundred drachmas, and give them to eat?
{6:38} And he says to them, How many loaves have ye? retire and see. And having known, they say, Five, and two fishes.
{6:39} And he commanded them all to recline a drinking together, drinking together upon the green grass.
{6:40} And the borders, the borders reclined, by one hundred, and by fifty.
{6:41} And having taken the five loaves and two fishes, having looked up to heaven, he praised, and he brake the loaves, and gave to his disciples that they might set before them; and the two fishes he divided to all.
{6:42} And they all ate, and were satisfied.
{6:43} And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and of fishes.
{6:44} And they eating the loaves were about five thousand men.
{6:45} And quickly he constrained his disciples to go to the ship, and to lead before to the other side of Bethsaida, till he loose the crowd:
{6:46} And having dismissed them, he went away to the mount to pray.
{6:47} And evening having come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone upon land.
{6:48} And he saw them trying to urge forward, for the wind was contrary to them: and about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them walking upon the sea, and he would pass by them.
{6:49} And having seen him walking upon the sea, they thought it was an apparition, and cried out:
{6:50} For all saw him, and were troubled. And quickly he spake with them, and says to them, Take courage: I am; be not afraid.
{6:51} And he went up to them to the ship; and the wind ceased, and they were greatly affected in mind above measure and wondered.
{6:52} For they understood not the loaves; for their heart was hardened.
{6:53} And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret, and put into a harbor.
{6:54} And they having come out of the ship, quickly having known him.
{6:55} Running round about that whole country, began to bring the afflicted upon couches, where they heard that he is there.
{6:56} And wherever he went, in towns, or cities; or fields, they set the sick in the market-places, and besought him that they might even touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched him were saved.
{7:1} And the Pharisees are gathered together to him, and certain of the scribes, having come from Jerusalem,
{7:2} And having seen some of his disciples with common hands, that is, unwashed, eating loaves, they rebuked.
{7:3} (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they vigorously wash hands, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
{7:4} And from the market-place, except they be immersed, they eat not. And there are many other things which they received to hold; the immersion of cups, and of measures, and of brazen vases, and of chairs.)
{7:5} Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Wherefore do not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?
{7:6} And he having answered, said to them, That Esaias prophesied well concerning you, as it has been written, This people honour me with lips, and their heart keeps far from me.
{7:7} And in vain they revere me, teaching doctrines the commands of men.
{7:8} For having left the command of God, ye hold firmly to the tradition of men, the immersion of measures and cups: and many other such like things ye do.
{7:9} And he said to them, Well do ye abrogate the command of God, that ye might keep your tradition.
{7:10} For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and he reviling father or mother, in death let him die:
{7:11} And ye say, If a man say to father or mother, Corban, which is, a gift, whatever thou be profited by me;
{7:12} And ye permit him to do nothing more for his father or his mother.
{7:13} Abrogating the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.
{7:14} And having called all the crowd, he said to them, Hear me, all ye, and do ye understand:
{7:15} There is nothing from without a man, entering into him, which can defile him: but things coming out from him, these are the things polluting the man.
{7:16} If any have ears to hear, let him hear.
{7:17} And when he came into the house from the crowd, his disciples asked him of the parable.
{7:18} And he says, So are ye also without understanding? Do ye not perceive, that anything from without entering into a man, cannot pollute him.
{7:19} For it goes not into the heart, but into the belly, and goes forth into the privy, purging all food.
{7:20} And he said, That going out of a man, that pollutes a man.
{7:21} For within, out of the heart of men, go forth evil reflections, adulteries, fornications, murders,
{7:22} Thefts, overreaching, deceit, licentiousness, an evil eye, defamation, pride, foolishness:
{7:23} All these evils go out from within, and pollute a man.
{7:24} And arising from thence, he departed into the bounds of Tyre and Sidon, and having come into the house, he would have none know; and he could not be hid.
{7:25} For a woman having heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, having come, fell at his feet:
{7:26} And the woman was a Grecian, a Syrophenician by birth; and she entreated him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.
{7:27} And Jesus said to her, Permit the children first to be satisfied; for it is not good to take the children's bread, and cast to little dogs.
{7:28} And she answered and says to him, Yes, Lord: for also the little dogs under the table eat from the children's crumbs.
{7:29} And he said to her, For this word retire; the demon has gone out of thy daughter.
{7:30} And having departed to her house, she found the demon gone forth, and the daughter cast upon the bed.
{7:31} And again, having gone out from the bounds of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, in the midst of the bounds of Decapolis.
{7:32} And they bring to him a deaf one, tongue-tied; and they beseech him that he would put the hand upon him.
{7:33} And having taken him away from the crowd apart, he put his fingers in his ears, and having spit, he touched his tongue;
{7:34} And having looked up to heaven, he sighed, and says to him, Ephphatha, which is, Be opened.
{7:35} And quickly his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake rightly.
{7:36} And he charged them that they should say to none: and as much as he charged them, they proclaimed more abundantly;
{7:37} And above measure were they struck with amazement, saying, Well has he done all things: he makes the deaf to hear, and the speechless to speak.
{8:1} In those days the crowd being very many, and having nothing they might eat, Jesus having called his disciples, says to them,
{8:2} I feel compassion for the crowd, for already they remain three days with me, and have nothing they might eat:
{8:3} And if I loose them fasting to their house, they will be relaxed in the way: for some of them have come from far.
{8:4} And his disciples answered him, Whence might anyone be able to satisfy these with loaves here in the lonely place?
{8:5} And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
{8:6} And he enjoined to the crowd to recline upon the earth: and having taken the seven loaves, having returned thanks, he brake, and he gave to his disciples that they might set before; and they set before the crowd.
{8:7} And they had a few little fishes: and having praised, he spake to set them also before.
{8:8} And they ate, and were satisfied: and they took up the remains of the fragments, seven wicker baskets.
{8:9} And they eating were about four thousand: and he loosed them.
{8:10} And quickly having gone into the ship with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
{8:11} And the Pharisees came out, and began to search out with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
{8:12} And having sighed deeply in spirit, he says, Why seeks this generation for a sign Verily I say to you, shall a sign be given to this generation.
{8:13} And having let them go, having gone again into the ship, he departed beyond.
{8:14} And they forgot to take loaves, and had not but one loaf with them in the ship.
{8:15} And he enjoined them, saying, See ye, look away from the leaven of the Pharisees, and the leaven of Herod.
{8:16} And they reasoned with one another, saying, Because we have no loaves.
{8:17} And Jesus having known, says to them, Why reason ye with yourselves, because ye have no loaves? observe ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?
{8:18} Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and remember ye not?
{8:19} When I brake the five loaves to five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say to him, Twelve.
{8:20} And when the seven to four thousand, the fillings of how many baskets of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.
{8:21} And he said to them, How do ye not understand.
{8:22} And he comes to Bethsaida; and they bring to him one blind, and beseech him that he would touch him.
{8:23} And having taken the hand of the blind, he led him forth without the town; and having spit into his eyes, having put hands upon him, he asked him if he saw any thing.
{8:24} And having looked up, he said, I see men that I see as trees, walking.
{8:25} Then again he put hands upon his eyes, and made him look up; and he was restored, and he saw all clearly.
{8:26} And he sent him to his house, saying, Thou shouldest not either enter into the town, neither, say to any in the town.
{8:27} And Jesus went out, and his disciples, to the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and he asked his disciples in the way, saying to them, Whom do men say me to be?
{8:28} And they answered, John the Immerser: and some, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
{8:29} And he says to them, And whom do ye say me to be? And Peter, having answered, says to him, Thou art Christ.
{8:30} And he rebuked them, that they should say to none concerning him.
{8:31} And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be disapproved of by the elders, and the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise up.
{8:32} And he spake the word with frankness. And Peter having taken him, began to rebuke him.
{8:33} And he having turned back, and having seen his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, Retire behind me, Satan: for thou hast not in mind the things of God, but the things of men.
{8:34} And having called the crowd with his disciples, he said to them, Whoever wills to come after me, let him absolutely deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
{8:35} For whoever wills to save his life shall lose it; and whoever should lose his life for my sake and the good news, the same shall save it.
{8:36} For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and injure his soul.
{8:37} Or what shall a man give for the exchange of his soul?
{8:38} For whoever should be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; also the Son of man shall be ashamed of him, when he should come in the glory of the Father with the holy messengers.
{9:1} And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That some of those are standing here, who should not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God having come in power.
{9:2} And after six days Jesus takes Peter, and James, and John, and brings them up into a high mountain apart alone: and he was transformed before them.
{9:3} And his garments were shining, exceeding white, such as no fuller on earth can make white.
{9:4} And Elias was seen to them, with Moses: and they were speaking together with Jesus.
{9:5} And Peter having answered, says to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tents; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
{9:6} For he knew not what he said; for they were terrified.
{9:7} And a cloud was overshadowing them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son: hear ye him.
{9:8} And suddenly, having looked around, they no more saw any one, but Jesus alone with them.
{9:9} And they coming down from the mount, he charged them that they recount to none what they saw, except when the Son of man should arise from the dead.
{9:10} And they held the word firmly to themselves, searching out together what it is to arise from the dead.
{9:11} And having asked him, saying, That the scribes say that Elias must first come.
{9:12} And he having answered, said to them, Elias truly having first come, restores all things; and how it has been written of the Son of man, that he suffer many things; and be set at nought.
{9:13} But I say to you, that Elias also has come, and they did to him whatever they would, as it has been written of him.
{9:14} And having come to the disciples, he saw a great crowd about them, and the scribes seeking out with them.
{9:15} And immediately all the crowd; having seen him, were amazed, and running near greeted him.
{9:16} And he asked the scribes, What seek ye together with them?
{9:17} And one from the crowd having answered, said, Teacher, I have brought my son to thee, having a speechless spirit.
{9:18} And wherever he overtakes him, he rends him: and he foams, and gnashes his teeth, and he is dried up: and I spake to thy disciples that they might cast him out; and they could not.
{9:19} And he having answered, says to him, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you how long shall I bear with you? bring him to me.
{9:20} And they brought him to him: and having seen him, quickly the spirit rent him; and having fallen upon the earth, foaming he rolled himself about.
{9:21} And he asked his father, How long is it that this has been to him? And he said, From childhood.
{9:22} And many times also it cast him into fire, and into water, that it might destroy him; but if thou canst anything, help us, having had compassion upon us.
{9:23} And Jesus said to him, If thou canst believe, all things possible to him believing.
{9:24} And quickly the child's father having cried out with tears, said, I believe, O Lord, help thou mine unbelief.
{9:25} And Jesus, having seen that the crowd ran together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Speechless and deaf spirit, I command thee to come out of him, and that thou come no more into him.
{9:26} And having cried and rent him much, it came forth, and he was as dead; so that many said, That he is dead.
{9:27} And Jesus having held him by the hand, raised him; and he stood up.
{9:28} And he having come into the house, his disciples asked him apart, Wherefore were we not able to cast him forth?
{9:29} And he said to them, This kind can go, out by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
{9:30} And having come out thence they passed through Galilee; and he desired not that any one should know.
{9:31} For he taught his disciples, and said to them, That the Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and having been killed, he shall raise himself the third day.
{9:32} And they knew not the word, and were afraid to ask him.
{9:33} And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What reasoned ye to yourselves in the way.
{9:34} And they were silent; for they discussed to one another in the way, who the greatest.
{9:35} And having sat down, he called the twelve, and says to them, If any wish to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.
{9:36} And having taken a young child, he set him in the midst of them: and having taken it up in his arms, he said to them,
{9:37} Whoever should receive ones of such young children in my name, receives me: and whoever should receive me, receives not me, but him sending me.
{9:38} And John answered him, saying, Teacher, we saw a certain one casting out demons in thy name, who follows not us: and we checked him, for he follows not us.
{9:39} And Jesus said, Check him not: for there is no one who shall do power in my name, and shall be able quickly to revile me.
{9:40} For whoever is not against us, is for us.
{9:41} For whoever should give you to drink a cup of water in my name, because ye are of Christ, verily I say to you, he should not lose his reward.
{9:42} And whoever should scandalize one of these little ones believing in me, it is good for him rather if a millstone is put about his neck, and he be cast into the sea.
{9:43} And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off; it is good for thee rather to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go away into hell, into inextinguishable fire:
{9:44} Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
{9:45} And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life lame, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into inextinguishable fire:
{9:46} Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
{9:47} And if thine eye offend thee, cast it out: it is good for thee, one-eyed, to come into the kingdom of God, than having two eyes to be cast into a hell of fire:
{9:48} Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
{9:49} For all shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
{9:50} Salt good: but if the salt be saltless, with what will ye prepare it? Have salt in yourselves, and live in peace one with another.
{10:1} And having risen from thence, he comes into the bounds of Judea, through the other side of Jordan: and crowds came together again to him; and, as he was accustomed, again he taught them.
{10:2} And the Pharisees having come near, asked him, if it is lawful for a man to loose his wife; tempting him.
{10:3} And he, having answered, said to them, What did Moses command you?
{10:4} And they said, Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce, and to loose.
{10:5} And Jesus, having answered, said to them, For your hard heart he wrote you this command.
{10:6} And from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.
{10:7} For this will a man leave his father and mother, and be attached to his wife;
{10:8} And they two shall be in one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh.
{10:9} What therefore God yoked together, let not man separate.
{10:10} And again in the house, his disciples asked him of the same.
{10:11} And he says to them, Whoever should loose his wife, and should marry another, commits adultery against her.
{10:12} And if a woman should loose her husband, and be married to another, she commits adultery.
{10:13} And they brought young children to him, that he might touch them: and the disciples rebuked those bringing.
{10:14} And Jesus, having seen, felt pain, and said to them, Permit children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
{10:15} Truly I say to you, Whoever should not receive the kingdom of God as a young child, should not come into it.
{10:16} And having taken them up in his arms, having put the hands upon them, he praised them.
{10:17} And he going in the way, one running and having fallen upon his knees, asked him, Good teacher, What shall I do that I might inherit eternal life.
{10:18} And Jesus said to him, Why sayest thou me good? none good, except the one God.
{10:19} Thou knowest the commands: Thou shouldst not commit adultery; Thou shouldst not kill; Thou shouldst not steal; Thou shouldst not bear false testimony; Thou shouldst not defraud; Honour thy father and mother.
{10:20} And he, having answered, said to him, O teacher, all these have I watched from my youth.
{10:21} And Jesus having looked upon him, loved him, and said to him, One thing is wanting to thee retire; whatever thou hast, sell, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, having taken up the cross.
{10:22} And he, being sad at the word, went away being grieved: for he had many possessions.
{10:23} And Jesus having looked round, said to his disciples, With what difficulty shall they having property enter into the kingdom of God.
{10:24} And his disciples were amazed at his words. And Jesus again having answered, says to them, How difficult, children, is it for those trusting in property to enter into the kingdom of God!
{10:25} It is easier labor for a camel to come through the hole of a needle, than for a rich one to come into the kingdom of God.
{10:26} And they were struck with amazement, excessively, saying to themselves, And who can be saved.
{10:27} And Jesus having beheld them says, With men impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.
{10:28} And Peter began to say to him, Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee.
{10:29} And Jesus having answered, said, Truly I say to you, There is none who has left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for sake of me, and the good news,
{10:30} Except he should receive a hundred-fold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mother, and children, and fields, with expulsions; and in the time coming eternal life.
{10:31} And many first shall be last; and the last first.
{10:32} And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was leading before them; and they were amazed; and following, they were afraid. And again taking the twelve, he began to say to them the things about to happen to him,
{10:33} For, behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests, and scribes; and they shall condemn him to death: and shall deliver him to the nations:
{10:34} And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall be raised up.
{10:35} And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying, Teacher, we wish that whatever we should ask, thou wouldst do for us.
{10:36} And he said to them, What wish you me to do for you?
{10:37} And they said to him, Give us that we might sit, one from thy right hand, and one front thy left, in thy glory.
{10:38} And Jesus said to them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink the cup which I drink? and the immersion with which I am immersed to be immersed.
{10:39} And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, Truly the cup which I drink shall ye drink; and the immersion with which I am immersed, shall ye be immersed.
{10:40} And to sit from my right hand, and from my left is not mine to give; but for whom it has been prepared.
{10:41} And the ten having heard, began to feel pain about James and John.
{10:42} And Jesus having called them, says to them, Ye know that they thinking to be first of the nations rule over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them.
{10:43} And it shall not be so among you: but whoever should wish to be great among you, shall be your attendant:
{10:44} And whoever of you should wish to be the first, he shall be the servant of all.
{10:45} For also the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his soul a ransom for many.
{10:46} And they come into Jericho: and he going out from Jericho, and his disciples, and a sufficient crowd, Bartimeus the blind, son of Timaeus, sat by the way asking alms.
{10:47} And having heard that it is Jesus the Nazarite, he began to cry, and to say, Son of David, O Jesus, compassionate me.
{10:48} And many were rebuking him, that he should be silent: and he cried much more, Son of David, compassionate me.
{10:49} And Jesus having stood, spake for him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Take courage, arise; he calls thee.
{10:50} And he, having cast away his garment, having risen, came to Jesus.
{10:51} And Jesus having answered, said to him, What wishest thou I should do to thee? And the blind said to him, Rabboni, that I might see again.
{10:52} And Jesus said to him, Retire; thy faith has saved thee. And quickly he looked up, and followed Jesus in the way.
{11:1} And when they draw near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount of Olives, he sends two of his disciples,
{11:2} And says to them, Retire into the town over against you: and quickly going into it, ye shall find a colt tied, upon which none of men has sat; having loosed, bring him.
{11:3} And if any say to you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord has need of him; and quickly will he send him here.
{11:4} And they went away, and found the colt tied to the door without by the road, and they loose him.
{11:5} And certain standing there said to them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
{11:6} And they said as Jesus charged them: and they let them go.
{11:7} And they brought the colt to Jesus, and they cast their garments upon him, and he sat upon him.
{11:8} And many strewed their garments in the way: and others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed in the way.
{11:9} And they going before, and they following, cried, saying, Osanna; praised he coming in the name of the Lord:
{11:10} Praised the kingdom coming in the name of the Lord of our father David: Osanna in the highest ones.
{11:11} And Jesus came into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and having looked around upon all things, the hour being already coming, he went into Bethany with the twelve.
{11:12} And in the morrow, they having come from Bethany, he hungered:
{11:13} And having seen a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if yet he shall find any thing upon it; and having come to it, he found nothing except leaves; for it was not time of the figs.
{11:14} And Jesus having answered, said to it, May none eat more fruit of thee forever. And his disciples heard.
{11:15} And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus having entered into the temple, began to cast out those selling and buying in the temple; and the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those selling doves he overturned;
{11:16} And he permitted not that any should bring a vessel through the temple.
{11:17} And he taught, saying to them, Has it not been written, That my house shall be called the house of prayer to all nations? and ye made it a den of robbers.
{11:18} And the scribes and chief priests heard, and they sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the crowd were struck with amazement at his teaching.
{11:19} And when it was evening, he went without the city.
{11:20} And in the morning, coming near, they saw the fig tree having been dried up from the roots.
{11:21} And Peter, having recalled to mind, says to him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is dried up.
{11:22} And Jesus having answered, says to them, Have the faith of God.
{11:23} For truly I say to you, That whoever should say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and should not discuss in his heart, but believe that what he says, is; it shall be to him, whatever he should say.
{11:24} For this I say to you, All things whatever, praying, ye ask, believe that ye receive, and it shall be to you.
{11:25} And when ye stand praying, let go, if ye have any thing against any one: that also your Father, he in the heavens, might let go to you your falls.
{11:26} And if ye do not let go, neither will your Father, he in the heavens, let go your falls.
{11:27} And they come again to Jerusalem: and he walking in the temple, the chief priests, and scribes, and elders come to him,
{11:28} And say to him, By what power doest thou these things? and who gave thee this power that thou doest these things?
{11:29} And Jesus having answered, said to them, And I will ask you one word, and answer ye me, and I will tell you by what power I do these things.
{11:30} Was the immersion of John from heaven, or from men? answer me.
{11:31} And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven; he will say, Wherefore did ye not believe him.
{11:32} But if we say, of men; they feared the people: for all held John, that he was truly a prophet.
{11:33} And having answered they say to Jesus, We know not. And Jesus having answered, says to them, Neither say I to you by what power I do these things.
{12:1} And be began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and put a fence round, and digged a winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went abroad.
{12:2} And he sent a servant to the husbandmen in time, that he might receive of the husbandmen from the fruit of the vineyard.
{12:3} And they, taking him, stripped, and sent away empty.
{12:4} And again he sent to them another servant; and having stoned the same they treated in a summary manner, and sent away despised.
{12:5} And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; truly stripping some, and killing some.
{12:6} Yet therefore having one dearly beloved son, and him he sent last to them, saying, That they will be changed by my son.
{12:7} And these husbandmen said with themselves, That this is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.
{12:8} And they having taken him, killed, and cast out of the vineyard.
{12:9} Therefore what will the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others.
{12:10} And have ye not read this writing; The stone which the builders disapproved of, this was for the head of the corner:
{12:11} This was of the Lord, and is wonderful in our eyes?
{12:12} And they sought to seize him, and they feared the crowd: for they knew that he spake this parable against them: and having let him go they went away.
{12:13} And they sent to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in the word.
{12:14} And they having come, say to him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and thou carest not for any one: for thou lookest not to the face of men, but in truth thou teachest the way of God: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or no?
{12:15} Should we give, or not give? And he knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a drachma that I might see it.
{12:16} And they brought. And he says to them, Whose is this image and inscription? And they said to him, Caesar's.
{12:17} And Jesus having answered, said to them, Give back Caesar's things to Caesar, and the things of God to God. And they wondered at him.
{12:18} And the Sadducees come to him, who say there is no rising up; and they asked him, saying,
{12:19} Teacher, Moses wrote to us, That if any one's brother die, and leave his wife, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
{12:20} There were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
{12:21} And the second took her, and died, and neither left he seed: and the third likewise.
{12:22} And the seven took her, and left no seed: and the woman died last of all.
{12:23} Therefore in the rising up, when they should rise, to which of them shall the woman be? for the seven had her a wife.
{12:24} And Jesus having answered, said to them, For this do ye not go astray, not knowing the writings, nor the power of God?
{12:25} For when they arise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the messengers which in the heavens.
{12:26} And concerning the dead that they are raised: have ye not read in the book of Moses, at the bramble, how God spake to him, I the God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.
{12:27} He is not God of the dead, but God of the living; ye therefore go astray greatly.
{12:28} And one of the scribes having come, having heard them seeking out together, knowing that he answered them well, asked him, Which is the first command of all?
{12:29} And Jesus answered him, That the first of all the commands, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:
{12:30} And thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart, and from thy whole soul, and from thy whole mind, and from thy whole strength: this the first command.
{12:31} And the second like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. No other command is greater than these.
{12:32} And the scribe said to him, Well, Teacher, in truth hast thou spoken: for one God is; and there is no other but he:
{12:33} And to love him from the whole heart, and from the whole understanding, and from the whole soul, and from the whole strength, and to love the neighbor as himself, is more than all the whole burnt offerrings, and the sacrifices.
{12:34} And Jesus having seen him that he answered understandingly, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And none dared to ask him any more.
{12:35} And Jesus having answered, said, teaching in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David.
{12:36} For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit from my right hand, till I set thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.
{12:37} Therefore David himself calls him Lord; and whence is he his son? And a great crowd heard him willingly.
{12:38} And he said to them in his teaching, Look from the scribes, wishing to walk in robes, and greetings in market-places,
{12:39} And first seats in synagogues, and first place at tables in first meals:
{12:40} They eating in widows' houses, and praying long for a pretext: these shall receive more abundant judgment.
{12:41} And Jesus having sat over against the royal treasury, saw how the crowds cast money into the treasury: and many rich cast in much.
{12:42} And one poor widow, having come, cast in two small coins, which is a farthing.
{12:43} And having called his disciples, he says to them, Truly I say to you, That this poor widow has cast into the royal treasury, more than all they casting into the treasury:
{12:44} For all they cast in out of the abundance to them; and she, out of her want, cast in all things which she had, her whole living.
{13:1} And he going out of the temple, one of his disciples says to him, Teacher, see of what country the stones, and of what country the buildings!
{13:2} And Jesus having answered, said to him, Seest thou these great buildings? stone upon stone shall not be left which shall not be loosed.
{13:3} And he sitting in the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him apart,
{13:4} Say to us, when shall be these things? and what the sign when all these be about to be finished?
{13:5} And Jesus having answered began to say to them, See ye lest any should lead you astray:
{13:6} For many shall come in my name, saying, That I am; and they shall lead many astray.
{13:7} And when ye hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not terrified: for it must be; but the end is not yet.
{13:8} For nation shall be raised against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be earthquakes in places, and there shall be famines, and commotions: these the beginnings of anguish.
{13:9} And see ye to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues shall ye be stripped: and shall be set before rulers and kings for my sake, for testimony to them.
{13:10} And the good news must first be proclaimed to all nations.
{13:11} And when delivering up, they bring you, take no care beforehand what ye speak, neither bestow attention: but whatever should be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for not ye are speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
{13:12} And brother shall deliver brother to death, and father child; and children shall rise up against parents, and kill them.
{13:13} And ye shall be hated by all for my name's sake: and he having remained to the end, the same shall be saved.
{13:14} And when ye see the abomination of desolation, that spoken by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him reading understand,) then let them in Judea flee to the mountains:
{13:15} And he upon the house, let him not come down into the house, nor let him come in, to take any thing away out of his house:
{13:16} And he being in the field, let him not turn back to take up his garment.
{13:17} And woe to them having in the womb, and to them giving suck in those days!
{13:18} And pray ye that your flight be not of winter.
{13:19} For those days shall be pressure, such as there has not been from beginning of creation which God created till now, and should not be.
{13:20} And except the Lord shortened the days, no flesh should be saved: but for the chosen whom he chose, he shortened the days.
{13:21} And if any say to you, Behold, here Christ; or, behold, there; believe ye not:
{13:22} For false Christ's and false prophets shall be raised up, and shall give signs and wonders, to deceive, if possible, also the chosen.
{13:23} But see ye; behold, I have foretold you all things.
{13:24} But in those days, after that pressure, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
{13:25} And the stars of heaven shall be falling out, and the powers which in the heavens shall be shaken.
{13:26} And then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with much power and glory.
{13:27} And then shall he send his messengers, and gather together his chosen from the four winds, from extremity of earth to extremity of heaven.
{13:28} And from the fig tree learn ye a parable; When its young shoot be tender, and cause the leaves to grow, ye know that summer is near.
{13:29} So also ye, when ye see these things done, ye know that it is near at the door.
{13:30} Truly I say to you, that this generation should not pass away, till all these things should be.
{13:31} Heaven and earth shall pass away, and my words shall not pass away.
{13:32} And concerning that day and hour none knows, nor the messengers in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.
{13:33} See, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
{13:34} As a man traveling, having left his house, and having given power to his servants, and to each his work, and he commanded the guard of the door that he should watch.
{13:35} Watch therefore: for ye know not when the lord of the house comes, at eve, or midnight, or cock-crowing, or morning.
{13:36} Lest having come suddenly he find you sleeping.
{13:37} And what I say to you, I say to all, Watch ye.
{14:1} And after two days was the pascha, and the unleavened loaves: and the chief priests and scribes sought how, having taken him by fraud, they might kill.
{14:2} And they said, Not in the festival, lest there be an uproar of the people.
{14:3} And he being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leprous, he reclining at table, a woman came having an alabaster box of perfumed oil of persuasive, costly, spikenard; and having broken the alabaster box, she poured upon his head.
{14:4} And there were some displeased in themselves, and saying, For what has been the loss of this perfumed oil?
{14:5} For this could have been sold for above three hundred drachmas, and have been given to the poor. And they raged against her.
{14:6} And Jesus said, Let her go; why bestow ye weariness upon her? she has wrought a good work upon me.
{14:7} For always have ye the poor with you, and when ye wish ye can do them good: and me ye have not always.
{14:8} And what she had, she has done: she has undertaken beforehand to perfume my body for the burial.
{14:9} Truly I say to you, Wherever this good news be proclaimed in the whole world, also what she has done shall be spoken for a memorial of her.
{14:10} And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.
{14:11} And having heard, they rejoiced, and promised to give him silver. And he sought how he might opportunely deliver him up.
{14:12} And in the first day of the unleavened, when they sacrificed the pascha, his disciples say to him, Where wilt thou, we, having gone, should prepare that thou eat the pascha.
{14:13} And he sends two of his disciples, and says to them, Retire to the city, and a man shall meet you bearing an earthen vessel of water; follow him.
{14:14} And wherever he should enter in, say to the lord of the house, That the Teacher says, Where is the room where I might eat the pascha with my disciples?
{14:15} And he will shew you a great apartment spread, ready: there prepare for us.
{14:16} And his disciples went out, and came to the city, and found as he said to them: and they prepared the pascha.
{14:17} And having been evening, he comes with the twelve.
{14:18} And they reclining and eating, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, That one of you shall deliver me up, he eating with me.
{14:19} And they began to be grieved, and to say to him one by one, What, not I? and another, What, not I?
{14:20} And he having answered, said to them, One of the twelve, he dipping with me into the small dish.
{14:21} Truly the Son of man retires, as has been written of him: and woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up! it were good for him if that man had not been born.
{14:22} And they eating, Jesus having taken bread, having praised, brake, and gave them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
{14:23} And having taken the cup, having returned thanks, he gave them: and they all drank of it.
{14:24} And he said to them, This is my blood, that of the new covenant, being poured out for many.
{14:25} Truly I say to you, that I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, till that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
{14:26} And having sung, they came out to the mount of Olives.
{14:27} And Jesus says to them, That all ye shall be offended with me in this night: for it has been written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
{14:28} But after I have risen, I will lead before you into Galilee.
{14:29} And Peter said to him, And if all shall be offended, yet not I.
{14:30} And Jesus says to him, Truly I say to thee, That to day, in this night, surely before the cock has uttered a sound twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.
{14:31} And he said more excessively, If I should die with thee, I shall not deny thee. And so likewise they all said.
{14:32} And they came to a place, the name of which Gethsemane: and he says to his disciples, Sit here, while I shall pray.
{14:33} And he takes Peter and James and John with himself, and began to be amazed, and to be dejected.
{14:34} And he says to them, My soul is sorely grieved, even to death: remain here, and watch.
{14:35} And having gone forward a little, he fell upon the earth and prayed that, if it be possible, the hour might pass away from him.
{14:36} And he said, Abba, Father, all things possible to thee; turn away this cup from me: but not what I will, but what thou.
{14:37} And he comes, and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? could eat thou not watch one Hour?
{14:38} Watch ye and pray, that ye should not come into temptation. Truly the spirit well inclined, and the flesh weak.
{14:39} And again having gone away, he prayed; saying the same word.
{14:40} And having turned back, he found them again sleeping, (for their eyes were loaded,) and they knew not what they might answer him.
{14:41} And he comes the third time, and says to them, Sleep the remaining time, and take rest: it is sufficient, the hour has come; behold, the Son of man is delivered into the hands of the sinful.
{14:42} Arise, and let us lead; behold, he delivering me up has drawn near.
{14:43} And quickly, he yet speaking, Judas approaches, being one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and scribes and the more ancient.
{14:44} And he delivering him up gave them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, this is he; seize him, and lead away safely.
{14:45} And having come, quickly having approached him, he says, Rabbi, rabbi; and kissed him.
{14:46} And they put their hands on him, and seized him.
{14:47} And a certain one of them standing by, having drawn a sword, struck the chief priest's servant, and took away his ear.
{14:48} And Jesus having answered, said to them, As against a robber come ye out, with swords and sticks to take me.
{14:49} Daily was I with you in the temple teaching, and ye seized me not: but that the writings might be completed.
{14:50} And having left him, they all fled.
{14:51} And one certain young man followed him, having cast a garment of fine linen over his nakedness; and the young men seized him:
{14:52} And having left the fine linen garment, he fled from them naked.
{14:53} And they led Jesus away to the pontificate: and all the chief priests and elders and scribes came with him.
{14:54} And Peter followed him from far, even to within the court-yard of the chief priest: and he was sitting with the attendants, and warming himself near the light.
{14:55} And the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus, to put him to death; and found not:
{14:56} For many testified falsely against him, and the testimonies were not alike.
{14:57} And certain having risen up testified falsely against him, saying,
{14:58} That we heard him saying, That I will abolish this temple made with hands, and in three days will I build another, made without hands.
{14:59} And neither so was their testimony alike.
{14:60} And the chief priest having risen up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what these testify against thee.
{14:61} And he was silent, and answered nothing. Again the chief priest asks him, and says to him, Art thou Christ, Son of the Praised.
{14:62} And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting from the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.
{14:63} And the chief priest, having rent his tunic, says, What further need have we of witnesses.
{14:64} Ye have heard the blasphemy; How does it appear to you? And they all condemned him to be liable to the penalty of death.
{14:65} And certain began to spit upon him, and to cover his face, and to cuff him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and the attendants struck him blows with rods.
{14:66} And Peter being in the hall how, one of the chief priest's young girls comes:
{14:67} And seeing Peter warming himself, having looked upon him, she says, And thou wast with Jesus the Nazarene.
{14:68} And he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand what thou sayest. And he went forth without into the vestibule; and the cock uttered a sound.
{14:69} And the young girl seeing him again, began to say to, them standing by, That this is of them: and again he denied.
{14:70} And after a little, again they standing by said to Peter, Truly thou art of them: for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech is like.
{14:71} And he began to anathematize and swear, That I know not this man of whom ye speak.
{14:72} And of the second time the cock uttered a sound. And Peter remembered the word which Jesus spake to him, That before the cock utter a sound twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And throwing blame, he wept.
{15:1} And quickly the chief priests having made counsel with the more ancient and scribes and the whole council, having bound Jesus, led away, and delivered to Pilate.
{15:2} And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And having answered, he said to him, Thou sayest.
{15:3} And the chief priests accused him much.
{15:4} And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how much they accuse thee.
{15:5} And Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered.
{15:6} And at the festival he loosed to them one in bonds, whomsoever they asked.
{15:7} And there was he called Barabbas, bound with those exciting sedition, who did murder in the revolt.
{15:8} And the crowd having cried, began to ask as he did always to them.
{15:9} And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye I loose to you the King of the Jews?
{15:10} For he knew that through envy the chief priests had delivered him up:
{15:11} And the chief priests moved the crowd, that he would rather loose Barabbas to them.
{15:12} And Pilate having answered, again said to them, What then will ye I should do to him whom ye call King of the Jews?
{15:13} And again they cried out, Crucify him.
{15:14} And Pilate said to them, But what evil has he done? And they cried out more excessively, Crucify him.
{15:15} And Pilate, willing to satisfy the crowd, loosed to them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, having scourged, that he might be crucified.
{15:16} And the soldiers led him away within the hall, which is the Pretorium; and they call together the whole band.
{15:17} And they clothed him with purple, and put round him, having woven, a thorny crown.
{15:18} And they began to greet him, Hail, O King of the Jews.
{15:19} And they struck his head with a reed, and they spit upon him, and having placed the knees, they worshipped him.
{15:20} And when they mocked him, they put off the purple from him, and clothed him with his own garments, and led him out that they might crucify him.
{15:21} And they constrain a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, passing by, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that he might take up his cross.
{15:22} And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, interpreted, The place of a skull.
{15:23} And they gave him wine to drink, prepared with myrrh: and he took not.
{15:24} And having crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon what any should take up.
{15:25} And it was the third hour, and they crucified him:
{15:26} And the inscription of his accusation was inscribed above, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
{15:27} And with him they crucify two robbers; one from the right, and one from the left.
{15:28} And the writing was completed, saying, And he was reckoned with the lawless.
{15:29} And they going by blasphemed him, shaking their heads, and saying, Ah, thou loosing the temple, and building in three days,
{15:30} Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
{15:31} And likewise also the chief priests, mocking to one another with the scribes, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
{15:32} Let Christ, King of Israel, come down from the cross, that we might see and believe. And they crucified with him reproached him.
{15:33} And being the sixth hour, darkness was upon the whole earth till the ninth hour.
{15:34} And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, for what hast thou forsaken me?
{15:35} And some of them standing by, having heard, said, Behold, he calls Elias.
{15:36} And one running and having filled a sponge with vinegar, and put round a reed, gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see if Elias will come to take him down.
{15:37} And Jesus having let go a great voice, expired.
{15:38} And the veil of the temple was split in two from above to below.
{15:39} And the centurion, standing over against him, having seen that having so cried out he expired, said, Truly this man was the Son- of God.
{15:40} And women also were beholding from far: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary of James the small and the mother of Joses, and Salome;
{15:41} (And they, when he was in Galilee, followed him and served him;) and many other women, having come up with him to Jerusalem.
{15:42} And being already evening, for it was the preparation, which is before sabbath,
{15:43} Joseph came from Arimathea, a distinguished counsellor, who also himself was expecting the kingdom of God, having ventured, he went in to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
{15:44} And Pilate wondered if he were already dead: and having called the centurion, he asked him if he had been dead long ago.
{15:45} And having known from the centurion, he bestowed the body to Joseph.
{15:46} And having bought fine linen, and taken him down, he rolled in fine linen, and placed him in a tomb, which was quarried out of a rock, and he rolled a stone at the door of the tomb.
{15:47} And Mary Magdalene and Mari of Joses were beholding where he is laid.
{16:1} And the sabbath having intervened, Mary Magdalene, and Mary of James, and Salome, bought spices, that having come, they might anoint him.
{16:2} And very early in the morning of one of the sabbaths, they came to the tomb, the sun having risen.
{16:3} And they said to themselves, Who shall roll away for us the stone from the door of the tomb?
{16:4} And having looked up, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.
{16:5} And having come to the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, being encompassed with a white robe; and they were terrified.
{16:6} And he says to them, Be not terrified: Ye seek Jesus the Nazarene, being crucified: he was raised; he is not here: see the place where they laid him.
{16:7} But retire ye; say to his disciples and to Peter that he goes before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said to you.
{16:8} And having come forth quickly, they fled from the tomb; and terror and amazement held them: and they said nothing to any; for they were afraid.
{16:9} And having risen early the first of the sabbath, he was manifested first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast seven demons.
{16:10} She having gone announced to them having been with him, grieving and weeping.
{16:11} And they having heard that he lives, and was seen by her, believed not.
{16:12} And after these things, to two of them, walking about, was he manifested in another form, they going into the field.
{16:13} And they having come announced to the rest: neither did they believe them.
{16:14} Afterwards to those reclining at table was he manifested, and he reproached their unbelief and hard heart, because they believed not them having seen him raised.
{16:15} And he said to them, Having gone into all the world proclaim the good news to all creation.
{16:16} And he having believed and having been immersed shall be saved; but he not having believed shall be condemned.
{16:17} And these signs shall follow those having believed; In my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;
{16:18} They shall take up serpents; and should they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall put hands upon the sick, and they shall be well.
{16:19} Truly therefore the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into the heavens, and sat on the right hand of God.
{16:20} And they, having gone forth, proclaimed every where, the Lord performing together, and confirming the word by signs following. Amen.
