{4:10} And the rest of the nations that the great and honored Asnapper carried into exile, and he caused them to dwell in the cities of Shomeron, and the rest beyond the river, and thus.
{4:11} This the copy of the epistle that they sent to him to Arthasatha the king; thy servants the men beyond the river, and thus.
{4:12} To be known to the king that the Jews who went up from with thee to us, came to Jerusalem, building the perverse and bad city, and they completed its wall, and they will repair its foundations.
{4:13} Now to be known to the king that if this city shall be built and the walls be completed, tribute, excise, and toll, they will not give, and in the end it will endamage the kings.
{4:14} Now for the cause that we were salted with the salt of the temple, and not being fit to us to see the king's nakedness, for this we sent and made known to the king;
{4:15} That it shall be sought in the book of the records of thy fathers: and thou wilt find in the book of the records, and thou wilt know that this city a city perverse and endamaging kings and provinces, and working rebellion in the midst of it from days forever: for this, this city was laid waste.
{4:16} We making known to the king that if this city shall be built, and its walls be completed, for this cause a portion beyond the river shall not be to thee.
{4:17} And the king sent word to Rehum, lord of judgment, and to Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their colleagues who dwelt in Shomeron, and the rest beyond the river, Peace and as now.
{4:18} The epistle that ye sent to us being read distinctly before me.
{4:19} And a decree being set from me, and they sought and found that this city from days forever lifting itself up against kings, and perverseness and rebellion being made in it.
{4:20} And strong kings were over Jerusalem, and ruling over all beyond the river: and tribute, excise, and, toll, being given to them.
{4:21} Now set up a decree to cause these men to cease, and this city shall not be built till a decree shall be set up from me.
{4:22} And be ye warned from doing wrong upon this: wherefore shall harm overtake to endamage the kings?
{4:23} Then after the copy of the epistle of Arthasatha the king being read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their colleagues, they went away to Jerusalem to the Jews, and caused them to cease by arm and strength.
{4:24} At that time ceased the work of the house of God which is in Jerusalem. And it was ceasing even till two years to the kingdom of Darius king of Persia.
{5:1} And the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and in Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, to them.
{5:2} At that time rose up Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Joshua son of Josedek, and began to build the house of God that is in Jerusalem: and with them the prophets of God upholding to them.
{5:3} In that time came to them Tatnai, prefect beyond the river, and Shethar-Bozni and their colleagues, and thus they said to them, Who set up to you a decree to build this house, and to complete this wall?
{5:4} Then thus said we to them, What are they the names of the men that build this building?
{5:5} And the eye of their God was upon the captivity of the Jews, and they caused them not to cease till the account went to Darius: and then they will return a letter concerning this.
{5:6} The copy of the epistle that Tatnai, prefect beyond the river, sent, and Shethar-Bozni and his colleagues, the Apharsachites, that were beyond the river to Darius the king:
{5:7} They sent an epistle to him, thus it was written in the midst of it: To Darius the king, all peace.
{5:8} To be known to the king that we went to the Judah province, to the house of the great God; and it was building with stone of rolling, and wood being set up in the walls; and this work being diligently done, and prospering in their hands.
{5:9} Then we asked these old men, thus we said to them, Who set to you a decree to build this house and to complete this wall?
{5:10} And also we asked their names for them to make known to thee that we shall write the name of the men that were among their heads.
{5:11} And thus they returned us word, saying, We are the servants of the God of the heavens and the earth, and build the house that was built of old these many years, and a great king to Israel built and completed.
{5:12} Therefore after our fathers provoked to the God of the heavens to be angry, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, the Chaldean, and he destroyed this house, and the people he carried away in exile to Babel.
{5:13} But in one year to Cyrus the king of Babel, Cyrus the king set up a decree to build this house of God.
{5:14} And also the vessels of the house of God of gold and of silver, that Nebuchadnezzar brought forth from the temple that is in Jerusalem, and brought them to the temple of Babel, Cyrus the king brought them forth from the temple of Babel, and they were given to Sheshbazzar his name that he set up prefect;
{5:15} And he said to him, Lift up these vessels, go bring them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and the house of God shall be built upon its place.
{5:16} Then this Sheshbazzar came, he set the foundations of the house of God that is in Jerusalem: and from that time even till now, being built and not finished.
{5:17} And now if good to the king he shall seek in the house of the king's treasure there that is in Babel, if it be that from Cyrus the king a decree was set up to build this house of God in Jerusalem, and the king will send the will to us concerning this.
{6:1} At that time Darius the king set up a decree, and they searched in the house of books, the treasures being deposited there in Babel.
{6:2} And there was found in Achmetha in the fortress that in the Median province, one roll, and thus a record was written in its midst.
{6:3} In one year to Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king set a decree of the house of God in Jerusalem, The house shall be built, the place that they sacrificed sacrifices, and its foundations being erected; its height sixty cubits, and its breadth sixty cubits;
{6:4} And three layers of stone of magnitude: and a layer of new wood: and the outgoing shall be given from the king's house:
{6:5} And also the vessels of the house of God of gold and of silver that Nebuchadnezzar brought forth from the temple that is in Jerusalem, and brought to Babel, shall be restored, and shall go to the temple that is in Jerusalem, to its place, and be taken into the house of God.
{6:6} Now Tatnai prefect beyond the river, Shethar-Bozni, and their colleagues the Apharsachites that are beyond the river, be ye far off from thence:
{6:7} Leave to the works of this house of God: the prefect of the Jews and the old men of the Jews, they shall build this house of God upon its place.
{6:8} And from me a decree was set up for that which ye shall do with the old men of these Jews for building this house of God: and the king's riches, that of the tribute beyond the river, expenses shall be speedily given to these men, not to be made to cease.
{6:9} And whatever being necessary, and the young of cattle and rams and lambs, for burnt-offerings to the God of the heavens, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the saying of the priests that are in Jerusalem, to be given to them day by day, not resting:
{6:10} That therefore bringing near sweet odors to the God of the heavens, praying for the life of the king and his sons.
{6:11} And from me a decree was set up that every man that shall change this word, wood shall be pulled down from his house, and being raised up he shall be fastened upon it; and his house shall be made a dung-hill for this.
{6:12} And God who shall cause his name to dwell there shall cast down every king and people that shall send forth his hand to change, to destroy this house of God that is in Jerusalem. I Darius set up a decree; it shall be done speedily.
{6:13} Then Tatnai, prefect beyond the river Shethar-Boznai, and three colleagues, because of that Darius the king sent, thus they did speedily.
{6:14} And the old men of the Jews built and prospered in the prophesy of Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah son of Iddo. And built and completed according to the decree of the God of Israel, and from the decree of Cyrus and Darius, and Arthasatha king of Persia.
{6:15} And this house was finished even to the third day to the month Adar, which was the sixth year to the kingdom of Darius the king.
{6:16} And the sons of Israel, the priests and the Levites and the rest of the sons of the exile, made the consecration of this house of God in gladness.
{6:17} And they brought near to the consecration of this house of God a hundred oxen, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and he goats of the goats for sin, for all Israel twelve, for the number of the tribes of Israel.
{6:18} And they set up the priests in their division, and the Levites in their classes, for the work of God which is in Jerusalem; according to the writing of the book of Moses.
{6:19} And the sons of the exile will do the passover in the fourteenth to the first month.
{6:20} For the priests and Levites were purified as one, all of them being purified; and they will slaughter the pass over for all the sons of the exile, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
{6:21} And the sons of Israel will eat; those turning back from exile and every one being separated from the uncleanness of the nations of the earth to them, to seek for Jehovah the God of Israel;
{6:22} And they will do the festival of the unleavened seven days in gladness: for Jehovah gladdened them, and turned the heart of the king of Assur to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
{7:1} And after these words in the kingdom of Arthasatha king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,
{7:2} Son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,
{7:3} Son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth,

{7:6} This Ezra went up from Babel; and he a scribe skilled in the law of Moses which Jehovah God of Israel gave: and the king will give to him according to the hand of Jehovah upon him all his seeking.
{7:7} And there will go up from the sons of Israel, and from the priests and the Levites, and those singing, and they watching the gates, and the Nethinims, to Jerusalem, in the seventh year to Arthasatha the king.
{7:8} And he will come to Jerusalem in the fifth month, this the seventh year to the king.
{7:9} For in one to the first month he laid the foundation of going up from Babel, and in one to the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
{7:10} For Ezra prepared his heart to seek the law of Jehovah, and to do, and to teach in Israel the law and judgment.
{7:11} And this the copy of the epistle which king Arthasatha gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, the scribe of the words of the commands of Jehovah and of his laws upon Israel.
{7:12} Arthasatha, king of kings, To Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of the heavens, being perfected, and thus.
{7:13} A decree was set from me that all being willing in my kingdom, from the people of Israel and his priests and Levites, to go to Jerusalem, shall go with thee.

{7:18} And whatever to thee and to thy brethren shall be good to do with the rest of the silver and gold; according to the will of your God ye shall do.
{7:19} And the vessels that are given to thee for the service of the house of thy God, restore before the God of Jerusalem.
{7:20} And the rest being necessary for the house of thy God, that shall fall to thee to give thou shalt give from the house of the king's treasure.
{7:21} And from me, I Arthasatha the king, a decree was set up to all the treasurers that are beyond the river, that all which Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of the heavens, shall ask of you, shall be done speedily,

{8:21} And I shall call a fast there, upon the river Ahava, to humble ourselves before our God, to seek from him a straight way for us and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
{8:22} For I was ashamed to ask from the king strength and horsemen to help us from the enemy in the way: for we said to the king, saying, The hand of our God upon all seeking him for good; and his strength and his anger against all forsaking him.
{8:23} And we will fast and seek of our God concerning this; and he will be entreated for us.
{8:24} And I shall separate from the chiefs of the priests twelve to Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them ten from their brethren.
{8:25} And I shall weigh to them the silver and the gold, and the vessels of the oblation of the house of God, that the king and his counselors and his chiefs and all Israel being found had lifted up.
{8:26} And I shall weigh to their hand the silver, six hundred and fifty talents, and vessels of silver to a hundred talents; gold, a hundred talents;
{8:27} And twenty goblets of gold to a thousand darics: and different vessels of good shining brass, desirable as gold.
{8:28} And saying to them, Ye are holy to Jehovah, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold a voluntary gift to Jehovah the God of your fathers.
{8:29} Watch and guard till ye shall weigh before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the chiefs of the fathers to Israel in Jerusalem in the cells of the house of Jehovah.
{8:30} And the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring to Jerusalem to the house of God.
{8:31} And we removed from the river Ahava in the twelfth to the first month, to go to Jerusalem: and the band of our God was upon us and he will deliver us from the hand of the enemy, and of him lying in wait upon the way.
{8:32} And we shall come to Jerusalem, and shall dwell there three days.
{8:33} And in the fourth day we shall weigh the silver and the gold and the vessels in the house of our God, by the hand of Meremoth son of Uriah the priest; and with him Eleazar son of Phinehas; and with them Jozabad son of Joshua, and Noadiah son of Levites;
{8:34} In number, in weight to all: and all the weight shall be written in that time.
{8:35} They coming from the captivity, the sons of the exile, brought near burnt-offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven he lambs, the he goats of the sin, twelve: all the burnt-offering to Jehovah.
{8:36} And they will give the king's laws to the king's satraps and prefects beyond the river: and they lifted up the people and the house of God.
{9:1} And in these things being finished, the chiefs came near to me, saying, The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites were not separated from the people of the lands according to their abominations, to the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, the Ammonite, the Moabite, the Egyptian and the Amorite.
{9:2} For they took from their daughters to themselves and to their sons: and the holy seed mingled themselves with the people of the lands: and the hand of the chiefs and the prophets was the first in this transgression.
{9:3} And in my hearing this word I rent my garment and my robe, and I shall pluck off from the hair of my head and my beard, and I shall sit down, being astonished.
{9:4} And to me all will assemble, trembling at the word of the God of Israel for the transgression of the exile; and I sat astonished till the sacrifice of the evening.
{9:5} And at the sacrifice of the evening I rose up from my humbling; and in my rending my garment and my robe and I shall bend upon my knees and spread forth my hands to Jehovah my God.
{9:6} And saying, My God, I was ashamed and disgraced to lift up my face, O my God, to thee: for our iniquities were multiplied over the head, and our guilt was magnified even to the heavens.
{9:7} From the days of our fathers we are in a great trespass even to this day; and in our iniquities we were given, we, our kings, our priests, into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity and to plunder, and to shame of face as this day.
{9:8} And now for a little moment grace was from Jehovah our God to leave to us an escaping, and to give to us a nail in his holy place, for our God to enlighten our eyes and to give us a little preservation of our life in our servitude.
{9:9} For we are servants; and in our servitude God forsook us not, and he extended to us mercy before the kings of Persia, to give to us the preservation of life to set up the house of our God, and to cause its desolations to stand, and to give to us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
{9:10} And now what shall we say, O our God, after this? for we forsook thy commands,
{9:11} Which thou didst command by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying, The land which ye are coming in to inherit it being a land of uncleanness in the uncleanness of the people of the lands in their abominations which filled it from mouth to mouth in their pollution.
{9:12} And now ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, and ye shall not take their daughters to your sons, and ye shall not seek their peace and their good even forever, so that ye shall be strong and eat the good of the land, and cause to your sons to inherit even forever.
{9:13} And after all coming upon us for our evil deeds, and in our great guilt, for thou our God didst withhold below our iniquities, and didst give to us an escaping according to this.
{9:14} Shall we turn back to break thy commands and to contract marriage with the people of these abominations? Wilt thou not be angry with us even to finishing, for not a remaining and escaping.
{9:15} O Jehovah God of Israel, thou art just: for we remained an escaping as this day: behold us before thee in our guilts; for not to stand before thee for.
{10:1} And as Ezra prayed, and as he confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there were gathered to him from Israel a very great convocation of men and women and children: for the people wept a great weeping.
{10:2} And Shecaniah son of Jehiel, from the sons of Elam, will answer and say to Ezra, We transgressed against our God, and we were dwelling with strange wives from the people of the land: and now there is hope to Israel concerning this.
{10:3} And now we will cut out a covenant to our God to bring forth all the wives, and those being born of them upon the counsel of my lord, and of those trembling at the command of our God; and according to the law it shall be done.
{10:4} Arise; for to thee the word, and we with thee: be strong and do.
{10:5} And Ezra will rise and cause the chiefs to swear, the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to do according to this word. And they will swear.
{10:6} And Ezra will rise up from before the house of God, and will go the chamber of Johanan son of Eliashib: and he will go there, he ate not bread and drank not water: for he was mourning for the transgression of the exiles.
{10:7} And they caused a voice to pass through Judah and Jerusalem to all the sons of the exile to gather, together at Jerusalem;
{10:8} And every one who shall not come in three days according to the counsel of the chiefs and the old men, all his substance shall be devoted, and he shall be separated from the convocation of the exile.
{10:9} And all the men of Judah and Benjamin will gather together at Jerusalem in three days. It was the ninth month, in the twentieth in the month, and all the people will sit in the broad place of the house of God, trembling for the word, and from the heavy showers.
{10:10} And Ezra the priest will rise up and say to them, Ye transgressed, and ye will dwell with strange wives to add upon the guilt of Israel.
{10:11} And now ye shall give praise to Jehovah the God of your fathers, and do acceptance: and separate from the people of the land and from the strange wives.
{10:12} And all the convocation will answer and say, with a great voice, So to do according to thy words to us.
{10:13} But the people many, and a time of heavy showers, and no power to stand without, and the work not for one day, and not for two: for we many transgressing in this word.
{10:14} And our chiefs to all the convocation shall stand now, and all who in our cities dwelt with strange wives, shall come at the appointed times, and with them the old men of city and city, and its judges, until the turning back the burning of the anger of our God from us even for this word.
{10:15} But Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahaziah, son of Tikvah, stood upon this: and Meshullam and Sabbethai the Levite helped them.
{10:16} And thus the sons of the exile will do. And they will be separated, Ezra the priest, men, heads of the fathers, for the house of their fathers, and all of them by names, and they will it down in one day to the tenth month to seek out the word.
{10:17} And they will finish with all the men dwelling with strange wives, even to one day to the first month.
{10:18} And there will be found from the sons of the priest who dwelt with strange wives: from the sons of Joshua son of Josedek and his brethren: Maaseiah and Eleazar, and Jarib and Gedaliah.
{10:19} And they will give their hand to bring forth their wives; and being guilty, a ram of the flock for their guilt.
