{1:1} The lifting up which Habbakuk the prophet saw.
{1:2} How long, O Jehovah, did I cry for help, and thou wilt not bear? I will cry to thee violence, and thou wilt not save.
{1:3} Wherefore wilt thou cause me to see vanity and cause me to look at labor? and oppression and violence before me, and there will be contention, and strife will be raised up.
{1:4} For this, the law will be slack, and judgment will not go forth forever: for the unjust surrounds the just; for this perverted judgment will go forth.
{1:5} See ye among the nations, and look, and wonder; ye shall wonder: for the working a work in your days ye will not believe if it shall be recounted.
{1:6} For behold me raising up the Chaldeans, the nation bitter and hasty, going upon the wide places of the land to possess the dwelling not to him.
{1:7} He terrible and dreadful: his judgment and his elevation shall come forth from himself,
{1:8} And his horses were swift above panthers, and they were sharp above the wolves of the evening: and his horsemen were spread, and his horsemen shall come from far off; they shall fly as the eagle hastening to eat.
{1:9} Wholly for violence shall he come: the host of their faces forwards, and he shall gather a captivity as the sand.
{1:10} And he shall scoff at kings, and princes a derision to him: at every fortress he shall deride, and he shall heap up dust and take it.
{1:11} Then the spirit changed, and he will pass over, and he transgressed: this his strength is his God.
{1:12} Art thou not from of old, O Jehovah, my holy God? We shall not die. O Jehovah, thou didst set him for judgment; and O Rock, thou didst found him for correction.
{1:13} Being pure of eyes from beholding evil, and wilt not be able to look upon labor: wherefore wilt thou look upon the transgressors? wilt thou be silent in the unjust swallowing the just above him?
{1:14} And wilt thou make man as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping thing no ruler over him?
{1:15} And he brought up a completion with the book, he will drag him in his net, and he will gather him in his fishnet: for this he will rejoice and be glad.
{1:16} For this he will sacrifice to his net and burn incense to his fish-net; for by them his portion fat and his food growing fat.
{1:17} For this, will he empty his net; and he will not spare to slay the nations continually.
{2:1} I will stand upon my watch, and be set me upon the fortress, and I will watch to see what he will speak in me, and what I shall turn back upon my reproof.
{2:2} And Jehovah will answer me and say, Write the vision, and grave upon the tablets, so that he shall run reading in it.
{2:3} For yet the vision for the appointment, and it shall breathe to the end, and it shall not lie: if it shall delay, wait for it; for coming, it will come; and it shall not delay.
{2:4} Behold, his soul being inflated in him, was not straight: and the just one shall live by his faithfulness.
{2:5} And also if a proud man transgressing by wine, and he will not rest; who enlarged his soul as hades, and he as death, and he will not be satisfied, and he will gather to him all nations, and he will collect to him all peoples.
{2:6} Shall not these all of them lift up a parable against him, and an enigma of an oracle against him, and it shall be said, Wo! to him multiplying that not to him, how long making heavy upon him goods taken in pledge?
{2:7} Shall they not rise up suddenly, biting thee? and they disquieting thee shall rise up, and thou wert for plunder to them.
{2:8} For thou didst spoil many nations, all the rest of the peoples shall spoil thee; from the bloods of man, and the violence of the land, of the city, and all dwelling in it.
{2:9} Wo! to him plundering an evil plunder to his house, to set his nest on high, to deliver from the hand of evil.
{2:10} Thou wilt counsel shame to thy house, cutting off many peoples, and causing thy soul to sin.
{2:11} For the stone from the wall shall cry out, and the cross-beam from the wood shall answer it.
{2:12} Wo! to him building a city with bloods, and preparing a city by iniquity.
{2:13} Behold, is it not from Jehovah of armies, and the peoples shall labor in a sufficiency of fire, and the peoples shall be wearied in a sufficiency of emptiness?
{2:14} For the earth shall be filled to know the glory of Jehovah as the waters shall cover over the sea?
{2:15} Wo! to him giving his neighbor drink, pouring out thy leathern bottle, and also to be drunken so as to look upon their nakedness.
{2:16} Thou wert satisfied with dishonor rather than honor: drink thou also and be uncircumcised: the cup of the right hand of Jehovah shall turn upon thee, and ignominy upon thy glory.
{2:17} For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of beasts shall terrify them from the bloods of man, and the violence of the earth, of the city, and all dwelling in it.
{2:18} What profited the carved image that he forming it carved it? the molten image and he teaching falsehood, that the former of his forming trusted upon it to make nothings being dumb?
{2:19} Wo! to him saying to the wood, Awake; and to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach. Being overlaid with gold and silver, and not any spirit in its midst.
{2:20} And Jehovah in his holy temple: be silent all the earth before his face.
{3:1} A Prayer by Habakkuk the prophet upon songs.
{3:2} O Jehovah, I heard thy report, I was afraid: O Jehovah, preserve alive thy work in the midst of years, in the midst of years make known; in anger thou wilt remember mercy.
{3:3} God will come from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran Silence. His majesty covered the heavens, and his praise filled the earth.
{3:4} And the brightness will be as the light; horns to him from his hand; and he set the hiding of his strength.
{3:5} Before his face shall go the word, and a flame will go forth at his feet.
{3:6} He stood, and he will measure the earth: he saw, and he will cause the nations to tremble, and the mountains of eternity will be dispersed, the perpetual hills bowed down: the goings everlasting to him.
{3:7} I saw the tents of Cushan under vanity: the curtains of the land of strife shall be moved.
{3:8} Was Jehovah angry against the rivers? if thine anger against the rivers? if thy wrath against the sea? if thou wilt ride upon thy horses, thy chariots of salvation?
{3:9} In nakedness thou shalt raise thy bow, the oaths of the tribes, he said. Silence. Thou wilt divide the earth with rivers.
{3:10} They saw thee, the mountains shall tremble: the pouring of the waters passed by: the deep gave his voice, he lifted up his hands on high.
{3:11} The sun, the moon stood in her habitation: at the light of thine arrows they will go, at the shining of the lightning of thy spear.
{3:12} In wrath thou wilt march through the land in anger, thou wilt thresh the nations.
{3:13} Thou wentest forth to save thy people, to save thy Messiah; thou didst crush the head from the house of the unjust, making naked the foundation, even to the neck. Silence.
{3:14} Thou didst pierce with rods the head of the leader: they will rush on as a tempest to scatter me their exultation as to devour the poor in secret.
{3:15} Thou didst tread upon the sea with thy horses, the heap of many waters.
{3:16} I heard and my belly will tremble; at the voice my lips quivered: rottenness will come into my bones, and I shall tremble under me that I shall rest at the day of straits: to come up to the people he will invade him.
{3:17} If the fig tree shall not blossom, and no produce in the vines; the work of the olive failed, and the fields made not food; and the sheep being cut off from the fold, and no oxen in the stalls.
{3:18} I will exult in Jehovah, I will rejoice in the God saving me.
{3:19} Jehovah the Lord my strength, and he will set my feet as the hinds, and upon my heights he will cause me to tread. For the overseer upon my stringed instruments.
