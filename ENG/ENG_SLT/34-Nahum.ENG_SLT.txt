{1:1} The lifting up of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
{1:2} God is jealous and Jehovah avenging; Jehovah avenging and possessing wrath; Jehovah avenging to his adversaries and he keeping for his enemies.
{1:3} Jehovah slow to anger and great of power, and Jehovah acquitting, will not acquit his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and a cloud the dust of his feet.
{1:4} Rebuking upon the sea, and he will dry it up, and all the rivers he laid waste, and Bashan languished, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languished.
{1:5} The mountains shook from him, and the hills melted, and the earth will lift up from his face, and the habitable globe and all dwelling in it.
{1:6} Before the face of his wrath who shall stand? and who will rise up in the burning of his anger? his wrath was poured out as fire, and the rocks were torn down from him.
{1:7} Jehovah is good for a fortress in the day of straits; and he knew those trusting in him.
{1:8} With an inundation passing through he will make a completion of her place, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.
{1:9} What will ye purpose against Jehovah? he made a completion: straits shall not rise up twice.
{1:10} For even to thorns surrounding them, and drinking to excess as drunkards, they shall be devoured as straw fully dried up.
{1:11} From thee shall he come forth purposing evil against Jehovah, a counselor of Belial.
{1:12} Thus said Jehovah: If peace thus many, and thus they were shown and he passed through. And afflicting thee I will afflict thee no more.
{1:13} And now I will break his rod from off thee, and I will tear away thy bonds.
{1:14} And Jehovah commanded concerning thee, of thy name no more shall be sown: from the house of thy God I will cut off the carved image and the molten image: I will set thy grave, for thou wert contemned.
{1:15} Behold upon the mountains the feet of him announcing good news, causing peace to be heard. O Judah, keep thy festivals, complete thy vows: for Belial shall no more add to pass through thee: he was completely cut off.
{2:1} The hammer came up upon thy face: press upon the fortress, look about the way, strengthen the loins, make the power strong greatly.
{2:2} For Jehovah turned back the pride of Jacob as the pride of Israel: for they emptying emptied them out, they corrupted their vine-shoots.
{2:3} The shield of the strong ones being red, the men of strength being clothed in scarlet: with fire of irons the chariots in the day of his preparing, and the cypresses were made to tremble.
{2:4} The chariots shall be mad in the streets, they shall run up and down in the broad places: their appearance as flames; as lightnings shall they run.
{2:5} He shall make mention of his chiefs: they shall be weak in their goings; they shall hasten to her wall, and the covering was prepared.
{2:6} The gates of the rivers were opened, and the temple melted away.
{2:7} It was fixed, she was led away captive, she went up and her maids being led as the voice of doves smiting upon their heart.
{2:8} And Nineveh it is as a pool of water from the days, and they fleeing, stood: they stood, and none looking back.
{2:9} They plundered silver, they plundered gold: and no end to her splendid equipage; glory from all the vessels of desire.
{2:10} She was emptied, and being emptied, and being made empty: and the heart melted, and a wavering of the knees, and trembling in all loins, and the face of them all gathered a glow.
{2:11} Where is the dwelling of the lions and that pasture for the young lions where the lion went, the lioness there, the lion's whelp, and none terrifying?
{2:12} The lion tore in pieces the sufficiency of his whelps, and strangling for his lionesses; and his holes shall be filled with the prey, and his dens with that torn in pieces.
{2:13} Behold me against thee, says Jehovah of armies; and I burnt her chariot in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions, and I cut of thy prey from the land, and the voice of her messengers shall no more be heard.
{3:1} Wo! to the city of bloods: all of it was filled with falsehood, with violence; the prey will not withdraw.
{3:2} The voice of the whip and the voice of the shaking of the wheel, and the horse moving swiftly, and the chariot bounding.
{3:3} The horsemen also lifting up the flame of the sword, and the lightning of the spear: and a multitude of wounded, and the heavy carcass; and no end to the corpses; they shall stumble upon their dead bodies.
{3:4} From the multitude of the fornications of the fair harlot, the beauty of the mistress of sorceries, selling the nations by her fornication, and families by her sorceries.
{3:5} Behold me against thee, says Jehovah of armies; and I uncovered thy skirts upon thy face, and I caused nations to see thy nakedness, and kingdoms thy shame.
{3:6} And I cast abominable things upon thee, and I disgraced thee, and I set thee as a sight.
{3:7} And it was all serving thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh was laid waste: who shall be moved for her? from whom shall I seek those consoling to thee?
{3:8} Wilt thou be good above No, the builder dwelling among the rivers, the waters round about to her, whose strength the sea, from the sea her wall?
{3:9} Cush her strength, and Egypt, and no end; Put and Lubim were among thy helpers.
{3:10} Also she being carried away captive went into captivity: also her young children shall be dashed in pieces at the head of every street, and upon her honored ones they cast the lot, and all her great ones were bound in chains.
{3:11} And thou shalt be intoxicated, and thou shalt be hid; thou shalt seek a fortified place from the enemy.
{3:12} All thy fortresses, fig trees with the early figs: if they shall be shaken, and they fell into the mouth of him eating.
{3:13} Behold, thy people women in the midst of thee: the gates of thy land being opened were opened to thine enemies: a fire devoured thy bars.
{3:14} Draw the water of the siege to thee, strengthen thy fortresses go into clay, tread upon the clay, hold fast from the brick.
{3:15} There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall devour thee as the feeder: make thee numerous as the feeder, make thee numerous as the locust.
{3:16} Thou didst multiply thy traffics above the stars of the heavens: the feeder spread out and it will fly away.
{3:17} Thy devoted ones as the locust, and thy satraps as the locust of locusts encamping in the walls in a cold day; the sun arose and they fled away, and where his place he knew not.
{3:18} Thy shepherds slumbered, O king of Assur: thy chiefs will lie down: thy people breathed upon the mountains, and none gathering.
{3:19} No healing to thy breaking; thy blow sickly: all hearing thy report shall clap the hand upon thee: for upon whom did not thine evil pass continually?
