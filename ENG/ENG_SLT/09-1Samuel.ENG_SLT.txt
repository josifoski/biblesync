{1:1} And there will be one man from Ramathaim-Zophim, from mount Ephraim, and his name Elkanah, son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
{1:2} And to him two wives; the name of the one Hannah, and the name of the second Peninnah: and there will be to Peninnah children, and to Hannah no children.
{1:3} And this man went up from his city from days to days, to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of armies in Shiloh. And there the two sons of Eli, Hophni, and Phinehas, priests to Jehovah.
{1:4} And the day will be and Elkanah will sacrifice, and he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughter, portions.
{1:5} And to Hannah he will give one portion more, for he loved Hannah; and Jehovah shut up her womb.
{1:6} Being grieved, her distress grieved her so that she was moved because Jehovah shut up about her womb.
{1:7} And so she will do year by year when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she will be grieved, and she will weep and will not eat.
{1:8} And Elkanah her man will say to her, Hannah, why wilt thou weep? and why wilt thou not eat? and why will thy heart break? am I not good to thee above ten sons?
{1:9} And Hannah will rise after eating in Shiloh, and after drinking: (and Eli the priest sat upon the throne by the door-post of the edifice of Jehovah:)
{1:10} And she bitter of soul, and she will pray to Jehovah, and weeping, she will weep.
{1:11} And she will vow a vow, and say, Jehovah of armies, if seeing, thou wilt see the affliction of thy servant and remember me, and thou wilt not forget thy servant, and give to thy servant seed of men, and I gave him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and a razor shall not come up upon his head.
{1:12} And it was when she multiplied to pray before Jehovah, and Eli watched her mouth.
{1:13} And Hannah she speaking upon her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice will not be heard: and Eli will think her to be intoxicated.
{1:14} And Eli will say to her, How long wilt thou be intoxicated? remove thy wine from thee.
{1:15} And Hannah will answer and say, No, my lord, I a woman hard of spirit, and wine and strong drink I drank not, and I will pour out my soul before Jehovah.
{1:16} Thou wilt not give thy servant before a daughter of Belial, for from the abundance of my complaint and my grief I spoke even till now.
{1:17} And Eli will answer and say, Go with peace: and the God of Israel shall give thine asking which thou didst ask of him.
{1:18} And she will say, Thy servant shall find grace in thine eyes. And the woman will go to her way, and ate, and her face is to her no more.
{1:19} And they will rise early in the morning and worship before Jehovah, and will turn back and will go to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah will know Hannah his wife, and Jehovah will remember her.
{1:20} And it will be at the return of days Hannah will conceive and bear a son, and she will call his name Samuel, for of Jehovah I asked him.
{1:21} And the man Elkanah and all his house will go up to sacrifice to Jehovah the sacrifice of days, and his vow.
{1:22} And Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, Till the boy shall be weaned, and I brought him, and he saw the face of Jehovah, and he shall sit there even to forever.
{1:23} And Elkanah her husband will say to her, Do the good in thine eyes; sit till thy weaning him; but Jehovah will raise up his word. And the woman will sit and suckle her son till her weaning him.
{1:24} And she will bring him up with her when she weaned him, with three bullocks and one ephah of flour, and a flask of wine; and she will bring him to the house of Jehovah in Shiloh, and the boy a youth.
{1:25} And they will slaughter the bullock, and they will bring the boy to Eli.
{1:26} And she will say, With leave, my lord, thy soul living, my lord, I the woman standing with thee in here to pray to Jehovah.
{1:27} For this boy I prayed, and Jehovah will give to me my asking which I asked of him.
{1:28} And I also lent him to Jehovah; all the days which he lives he is lent to Jehovah. And they will worship to Jehovah there.
{2:1} And Hannah will pray and say, My heart rejoiced in Jehovah, my horn was lifted up in Jehovah; my mouth was enlarged over mine enemies; for I was glad in thy salvation.
{2:2} None holy as Jehovah, for none beside thee: and no rock as our God.
{2:3} Ye shall not enlarge; will ye speak proud, proud? shall the impatient thing come forth from your mouth for Jehovah a God of knowledge, and doings were not made equal.
{2:4} The bows of the mighty being broken, and the weak were girded with strength.
{2:5} And those filled with bread hired themselves out; and they hungering, ceased till the barren shall bring forth seven; and she multiplying sons languished.
{2:6} Jehovah killing and giving life; bringing down to hades and bringing up.
{2:7} Jehovah dispossessing, and enriching: making low, but lifting up.
{2:8} Raising up the weak from the dust, he will raise up the needy from the dung-hill to sit with the noble, and he will cause them to inherit a throne of glory, for to Jehovah the castings of the earth, and he will put the habitable globe upon them.
{2:9} He will watch the feet of the merciful and the unjust shall be silent in darkness; for not by strength shall man prevail.
{2:10} Jehovah, they contending against him, shall be broken; in the heavens he will break them in pieces: Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth, and he will give strength to his king, and he will lift up the horn of his Messiah.
{2:11} And Elkanah will go to Ramah, to his house. And the boy was serving Jehovah in the face of Eli the priest.
{2:12} And the sons of Eli, sons of Belial; they knew not Jehovah.
{2:13} And the priests judging the people, every man sacrificing a sacrifice; and the boy of the priest came as the flesh boiled, and the fork of three teeth in his hand;
{2:14} And he struck into the fire-pan or into the boiler, or into the kettle, or into the pot; all which the fork will bring up the priest will take for himself. So they will do to all Israel coming there into Shiloh.
{2:15} Also before they will burn the fat and the boy of the priest came and said to the man sacrificing, Thou shalt give flesh to roast for the priest; and he will not take from thee flesh boiled but living.
{2:16} And the man will say to him, Burning, they shall burn the fat as the day, and take to thee as thy soul shall desire; and he said to him, But now thou shalt give, and if not I will take by force.
{2:17} And the sin of the boys will be exceedingly great before Jehovah, for the men despised the gifts of Jehovah.
{2:18} And Samuel serving before Jehovah, a boy girded with an ephod of linen.
{2:19} And his mother will make to him a little upper garment, and bring up to him from days to days, in her coming up with her husband to sacrifice the sacrifice of days.
{2:20} And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah will set up to thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to Jehovah. And they went to his place.
{2:21} For Jehovah reviewed Hannah, and she will conceive and bear three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel will be magnified with Jehovah.
{2:22} And Eli a very old man, and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and they will lie with the women going forth at the door of the tent of appointment.
{2:23} And he will say to them, Wherefore will ye do according to these words? which I heard very evil words of all this people.
{2:24} Nay, sons, for not a good report which I heard: causing the people of Jehovah to pass by.
{2:25} If a man shall sin against a man, and God judged him; and if a man shall sin against Jehovah, who shall judge for him? and they will not hear to the voice of their father for Jehovah was willing to destroy them.
{2:26} And the boy Samuel going, will become great and good, also with Jehovah and with men.
{2:27} And a man of God will come to Eli and say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Revealing myself, I was revealed to the house of thy father in their being in Egypt to the house of Pharaoh.
{2:28} And choosing him from all the tribes of Israel to me for priest, to bring up upon mine altar to burn incense, to lift up the ephod before me; and I gave to the house of thy father all the fires of the sons of Israel.
{2:29} Wherefore will ye trample upon my sacrifice and upon my gifts which I commanded to my habitation? and thou wilt honor thy sons above me to fatten yourselves from the chief of all the gifts of Israel my people.
{2:30} For this Jehovah the God of Israel said, Saying, I said, Thy house and the house of thy father shall go before me even forever: and now Jehovah said, Far be it for me; for them honoring me I will honor, and they despising me shall be contemned.
{2:31} Behold, the days coming and I cut off thy seed and the seed of thy father's house from being old in thy house.
{2:32} And thou lookedst upon the straits of the habitation in all which shall seem good with Israel; and an old man shall not be in thy house all the days.
{2:33} And a man I will not cut off to thee from mine altar to finish thine eyes and to cause thy soul to pine away: and all the increase of thy house, the men, shall die.
{2:34} And this the sign to thee which shall come to thy two sons to Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they two shall die.
{2:35} And I raised up to me a faithful priest, as in my heart and in my soul he shall do: and I built to him a faithful house; and he went before my Messiah all the days.
{2:36} And it was all being left in thy house shall go to worship to him for a piece of silver and a round of bread; and he said, Add me to one of the priesthoods to eat a morsel of bread.
{3:1} And the boy Samuel serving Jehovah before Eli, and the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; no vision spread abroad.
{3:2} And it will be in that day, and Eli lay down in his place, and his eyes began to be weak; he will not be able to see.
{3:3} And before the lamp of God shall go out, and Samuel lay down in the edifice of Jehovah where there the ark of God.
{3:4} And Jehovah will call to Samuel, and he will say, Behold me.
{3:5} And he will run to Eli, and say, Behold me, for thou didst call to me. And he will say, I called not; turn back, lie down. And he will go and lie down.
{3:6} And Jehovah will add yet to call Samuel. And Samuel will rise and go to Eli, and say, Behold me, for thou calledst to me. And he will say, I called not my son; turn back, lie down.
{3:7} And before Samuel will know Jehovah, and before the word of Jehovah will be revealed to him,
{3:8} And Jehovah will add to call Samuel in the third time. And he will rise and go to Eli, and say, Behold me, for thou didst call to me. And Eli will discern that Jehovah called the boy.
{3:9} And Eli will say to Samuel, Go, lie down; and it being if he shall call to thee, and say thou, Speak, Jehovah, for thy servant heard. And Samuel will go and lie down in his place.
{3:10} And Jehovah will come and stand and call as once to once, Samuel, Samuel. And Samuel will say, Speak, for thy servant heard.
{3:11} And Jehovah will say to Samuel, Behold, I do a word in Israel which every one hearing it his two ears shall tingle.
{3:12} In that day I will set up all against Eli which I spake against his house, beginning and finishing.
{3:13} And I announced to him that I judge his house even forever, for the iniquity which he knew: for his sons cursing for themselves and he admonished them not.
{3:14} And for this I sware to the house of Eli if the iniquity of the house of Eli shall be covered with sacrifice and with gifts even forever.
{3:15} And Samuel will lie down till the morning, and he will open the doors of the house of Jehovah: and Samuel will be afraid of announcing the vision to Eli.
{3:16} And Eli will call Samuel, and say, Samuel, my son. And he will say, Behold me.
{3:17} And he will say, What the word he spake to thee? not now shalt thou hide from me: so will God do to thee, and so will he add, if thou shalt hide from me a word of all the word which he spake to thee.
{3:18} And Samuel will announce to him all the words, and he hid not from him. And he will say, It is Jehovah: the good in his eyes he will do.
{3:19} And Samuel will be magnified, and Jehovah was with him, and there fell not from all his words to the earth.
{3:20} And all Israel knew from Dan to the Well of the Oath, that Samuel was faithful for a prophet to Jehovah.
{3:21} And Jehovah will add to be seen in Shiloh: for Jehovah was revealed to Samuel by the word of Jehovah in Shiloh.
{4:1} And the word of Samuel will be to all Israel. And Israel will go forth to the meeting of Philisteim for war, and they will encamp upon the Stone of Help: and Philisteim encamped in Aphek.
{4:2} And Philisteim will set in array to meet Israel: and the battle will smite, and Israel will be smitten before Philisteim: and they will strike the array in the field, about four thousand men.
{4:3} And the people will come to the camp, and the old men of Israel will, say, Wherefore did Jehovah smite us this day before Philisteim? We will take to us from Shiloh the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and it shall come into the midst of us and save us from the hand of our enemies.
{4:4} And the people will send to Shiloh, and they will lift up from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of armies, sitting upon the Cherubims: and there the two sons of Eli with the ark of the covenant of God, Hophni and Phinehas.
{4:5} And it will be when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the camp, and all Israel will shout with great shouts, and the earth will be put in motion.
{4:6} And Philisteim will hear the voice of the shout, and they will say, What the voice of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? and they knew that the ark of Jehovah came into the camp.
{4:7} And the Philisteim will be afraid, for they said, God came into the camp. And they will say, Wo to us! for at was not as this yesterday, the third day.
{4:8} Wo to us! who shall deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? these those gods smiting Egypt with every blow in the desert.
{4:9} Be strong, and be for men, Philisteim, lest ye shall serve to the Hebrews as they served to you: and be for men and fight.
{4:10} And Philisteim will fight and smite Israel, and they will flee, a man to his tent: and the blow will be very great, and there will fall from Israel thirty thousand footmen.
{4:11} And the ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli were slain, Hophni and Phinehas.
{4:12} And a man of Benjamin will run from the array, and he will come to Shiloh in that day; and his garments rent and earth upon his head.
{4:13} And he will come, and behold, Eli sitting upon a seat of the side of the way, looking about: for his heart was trembling for the ark of God. And the man came to announce in the city, and all the city will cry out.
{4:14} And Eli will hear the voice of the cry, and will say, What the voice of this noise? And the man hastened, and he will go in and announce to Eli.
{4:15} And Eli the son of ninety and eight years; and his eyes standing, and he will not be able to see.
{4:16} And the man will say to Eli, I came from the array, and I fled from the array this day; And he will say, What was the word, my son?
{4:17} And he bearing tidings will answer and say, Israel fled before Philisteim, and also a great slaughter was among the people, and also thy two sons died, Hophni and Phinehas; and the ark of God was taken.
{4:18} And it will be when he made mention of the ark of God, and he will fall from off the seat backwards by the side of the gate, and his neck will break, and he will die: for he was an old Man and heavy. And he judged Israel forty years.
{4:19} And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, conceived to bring forth: and she will hear the message of the taking of the ark of God, and the death of her father-in-law and her husband, and she will bow and bring forth, for her pains turned upon her.
{4:20} And about the time of her death, and they standing by will speak to her, Thou shalt not be afraid, for thou broughtest forth a son. And she answered not, and set not her heart.
{4:21} And she will call the boy, Where the Glory? saying, The glory uncovered from Israel: (for the taking of the ark of God, and for her father-in-law, and her husband.)
{4:22} And she will say, The glory uncovered from Israel, for the ark of God was taken.
{5:1} And Philisteim took the ark of God, and they will bring it from the Stone of Help to Ashdod.
{5:2} And Philisteim will take the ark of God and bring it to the house of Dagon, and they will set it up by Dagon.
{5:3} And the Ashdodites will rise early on the morrow, and behold, Dagon fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of Jehovah. And they will take Dagon, and will turn him back to his place.
{5:4} And they will rise early in the morning, and behold, Dagon fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of Jehovah: and the head of Dagon, and the two palms of his hands cut off upon the threshold; only Dagon was left upon him.
{5:5} Therefore the priests of Dagon, and all coming into Dagon's house, will not tread upon the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod even to this day.
{5:6} And the hand of Jehovah will be heavy upon the Ashdodites, and he will lay them waste and smite them with tumors, Ashdod and her bounds.
{5:7} And the men of Ashdod will see that it is thus, and they will say, The ark of the God of Israel shall not dwell with us, for his hand was hard upon us and upon Dagon our god.
{5:8} And they will send and gather all the princes of Philisteim to them, and they will say, What shall we do to the ark of the God of Israel? And they will say, To Gath shall the ark of the God of Israel be turned about: and they will turn the ark of the God of Israel about.
{5:9} And it will be after they turned it about, and the hand of Jehovah will be against the city with a very great consternation: and he will smite the men of the city from small and even to great, and tumors will break forth to them.
{5:10} And they will send the ark of God to Ekron. And it will be when the ark of God came to Ekron, and the Ekronites will cry out, saying, They turned about to me the ark of the God of Israel to kill me and my people.
{5:11} And they will send and gather all the princes of Philisteim, and they will say, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and it shall turn back to its place, and it shall not slay me and my people: for the consternation of death was in all the city; the hand of God was greatly heavy there.
{5:12} And the men who died not were struck with tumors: and the cry of the city will go up to the heavens.
{6:1} And the ark of Jehovah will be in the field of Philisteim seven months.
{6:2} And Philisteim will call for the priests and for the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of Jehovah? make known to us in what we shall send it to its place?
{6:3} And they will say, If sending away the ark of the God of Israel, ye shall not send it away empty; for turning back, ye shall turn back a trespass: then ye shall be healed and we shall make known to you why his hand shall not be removed from you.
{6:4} And they will say, What the trespass that we shall turn back to him? And they will say, The number of the princes of Philisteim, five gold tumors, and five gold mice: for one smiting upon them all and upon your princes.
{6:5} And make likenesses of your tumors, and likenesses of your mice destroying the land; and give glory to the God of Israel: perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
{6:6} And why shall ye make your hearts heavy, as Egypt and Pharaoh made their heart heavy? Did he not then do wonders among them, and they will send them away, and they will go?
{6:7} And now take and make one new wagon, and two heifers giving milk, which a yoke came not up upon them, and make fast the heifers upon the wagon, and turn back their young from after them to the house.
{6:8} And take the ark of Jehovah and set it upon the wagon; and the vessels of gold which ye turned back to him ye shall put a trespass in a box from its side; and send it, and it went.
{6:9} And see if it shall go up the way of its bound to the House of the Sun, it did to us this great evil: and if not we shall know that not his hand struck upon us; it was a chance to us.
{6:10} And the men did so, and they will take two heifers giving milk, and they will make them fast to the wagon, and they shut up their young in the house.
{6:11} And they set the ark of Jehovah into the wagon, and the box, and the mice of gold, and the likenesses of the tumors.
{6:12} And the heifers will look about in the way, upon the way of the House of the Sun, in one highway they went going, and they lowed, and they turned not to the right and to the left; and the princes of Philisteim went after them, even to the bound of the House of the Sun.
{6:13} And the House of the Sun reaping the harvest of wheat in the valley: and they will lift up their eyes and see the ark, and they will rejoice to see.
{6:14} And the wagon came into the field of Joshua of the House of the Sun, and it will stand there; and there a great stone: and they will cleave asunder the wood of the wagon, and the heifers they brought up a burnt-offering to Jehovah.
{6:15} And the Levites brought down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer that was with it, which in it the vessels of gold, and put upon the great stone: and the men of the House of the Sun brought up burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices in that day to Jehovah.
{6:16} And the five princes of Philisteim saw, and they will turn back to Ekron in that day.
{6:17} And these the tumors of gold which Philisteim turned back a trespass to Jehovah; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one.
{6:18} And the mice of gold, the number of all the cities of Philisteim, to the five princes from the fortified city, even to the village of the countryman, and even to the great meadow which they put upon it the ark of Jehovah, even to this day in the field of Joshua of the House of the Sun.
{6:19} And he will strike upon the men of the House of the Sun, for they saw in the ark of Jehovah, and he will strike upon the people seventy men, and fifty thousand men: and the people will mourn because Jehovah smote among the people a great smiting.
{6:20} And the men of the House of the Sun will say, Who shall be able to stand before Jehovah this holy God? and to whom shall it go up from us?
{6:21} And they will send messengers to the inhabitants of the City of Forests, saying, Philisteim turned back the ark of Jehovah; come down, bring it up to you.
{7:1} And the men of the City of Forests will come up and will bring up the ark of Jehovah, and they will bring it to the house of Abinadab in the hill, and Eleazar his son he consecrated to Watch the ark of Jehovah.
{7:2} And it will be from the day the ark dwelt in the City of Forests, and the days will be multiplied; and they will be twenty years: and all the house of Israel will lament after Jehovah.
{7:3} And Samuel will say to all the house of Israel, saying, If with all your heart ye turn back to Jehovah, remove the strange gods out of the midst of you, and Ashtaroth, and prepare your hearts to Jehovah, and serve him alone, and he will deliver you from the hand of Philisteim.
{7:4} And the sons of Israel will put away the Baalims and Ashtaroth, and will serve Jehovah alone.
{7:5} And Samuel will say, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to Jehovah.
{7:6} And they will gather together to Mizpeh, and draw water and pour out before Jehovah; and they will fast in that day and say there, We sinned against Jehovah. And Samuel will judge the sons of Israel in Mizpeh.
{7:7} And Philisteim will hear that the sons of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, and the princes of Philisteim will go up against Israel And the sons of Israel will hear, and be afraid of the face of Philisteim.
{7:8} And the sons of Israel will say to Samuel, Thou wilt not keep silence from us, crying to Jehovah our God, and he will save us from the hand of Philisteim.
{7:9} And Samuel will take one fat lamb and bring up a burnt-offering wholly to Jehovah: and Samuel will cry to Jehovah for Israel, and Jehovah will answer him.
{7:10} And Samuel will be bringing up the burnt-offering, and Philisteim drew near to war against Israel: and Jehovah will thunder with a great voice in that day upon Philisteim and he will discomfit them; and they will be smitten before Israel.
{7:11} And the men of Israel will go forth out of Mizpeh and they will pursue Philisteim, and they will strike them even from beneath to the House of Pasture.
{7:12} And Samuel will take one stone and set between Mizpeh and between Shen, and he will call its name the Stone of Help; and he will say, Till now Jehovah helped us.
{7:13} And Philisteim will be subdued, and they will no more add to come into the bound of Israel: and the hand of Jehovah will be against Philisteim all the days of Samuel.
{7:14} And the cities that Philisteim took from Israel will be turned back to Israel, from Ekron, even to Gath; and their bound Israel will deliver from the hand of Philisteim: and peace will be between Israel and between the Amorite.
{7:15} And Samuel will judge Israel all the days of his life.
{7:16} And he went as often as from year to year, and be turned about the House of God, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and he judged Israel in all these places.
{7:17} And his turning back to Ramah; for there his house; and there he judged Israel; and he will build an altar there to Jehovah.
{8:1} And it will be when Samuel was old, he set his sons judges to Israel.
{8:2} And the name of his son the firstborn will be Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: judges at the Well of the Oath.
{8:3} And his sons went not in his way, and they will incline after plunder, and they will take a gift, and they will turn away from judgment.
{8:4} And all the old men of Israel will gather together and will come to Samuel to Ramah;
{8:5} And they will say to him, Behold, thou wert old, and thy sons went not in thy ways: now set up for us a king to judge us as all the nations.
{8:6} And the word will be evil in the eyes of Samuel when they said, Give to us a king to judge us: and Samuel will pray to Jehovah.
{8:7} And Jehovah will say to Samuel, Hear to the voice of the people to all which they will say to thee: for not thee did they reject, but me they rejected from reigning over them.
{8:8} According to all the works which they did from the day I brought them up out of Egypt, and even to this day, and they will forsake me and serve other gods, so they do also to thee.
{8:9} And now hear to their voice: but protesting, thou shalt protest to them, and announce to them the judgment of the king who shall reign over them.
{8:10} And Samuel will say all the words of Jehovah to the people asking from him a king.
{8:11} And he will say, This shall be the judgment of the king who shall reign over you: your sons he will take and set for himself, for his chariots and for his horsemen; and running before his chariots.
{8:12} And to set to himself captains of thousands and captains of fifties; and to plough his ploughing and to reap his harvest, and to do all his fighting and all his chariots.
{8:13} And your daughters he will take for perfumers, and for cooks, and for bakers.
{8:14} And your fields and your vineyards, and your olive trees, the good he will take and give to his servants.
{8:15} And of your seeds and of your vineyards he will take the tenth and give to his eunuchs and to his servants.
{8:16} And your servants and your maids, and your good young men, and your asses, he will take and make for his services.
{8:17} And of your sheep he will take the tenth: and ye shall be to him for servants.
{8:18} And ye cried out in that day from before your king which ye chose to yourselves; and Jehovah will not answer you in that day.
{8:19} And the people will refuse to hear to the voice of Samuel; and they will say, Nay; but a king shall be over us.
{8:20} And we were as all the nations; and our king judged us and went out before us, and fought our battles.
{8:21} And Samuel will hear all the words of the people, and he will speak them in the ears of Jehovah.
{8:22} And Jehovah will say to Samuel, Hear to their voice, and make a king for them. And Samuel will say to them, Go ye a man to his city.
{9:1} And there will be a man of Benjamin, and his name Kish, son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Bechorah, son of Aphiah, son of a man, a Jaminite, a man of strength.
{9:2} And to him was a son and his name Saul, a young man and good: and not a man of the sons of Israel good above him: from his shoulder and from above, high above all the people.
{9:3} And the she asses of Kish, Saul's father, will be lost: and Kish will say to Saul, his son, Take now with thee one of the boys, and arise, Go seek the asses.
{9:4} And he will pass over in mount Ephraim, and he will pass over into the land of Shalisha, and they found not: and they will pass over into the land of Shalim, and not there: and he will pass over into the land of the Jaminite, and they found not.
{9:5} They went into the land of Zuph, and Saul said to his boy that was with him, Come, and we will turn back, lest my father shall leave from the asses, and be afraid for us.
{9:6} And he will say to him, Behold now, a man of God in this city, and the man honored; all which he shall speak, coming, will come: now we will go there, perhaps he will announce to us our way which we went upon it.
{9:7} And Saul will say to his boy, And behold, we will go, and what shall we bring to the man? for the bread departed from our vessels, and not a gift to bring to the man of God: what with us?
{9:8} And the boy will add to answer Saul, and he will say, Behold, we shall find in my hand the fourth of a shekel of silver: and I gave it to the man of God and he announced to us our way.
{9:9} Before in Israel thus said the man in his going to inquire of God, Come, and we will go even to him seeing, for a prophet this day he will be called; before him seeing.
{9:10} And Saul will say to his boy, Thy word was good; going, we will go: and they will go to the city where was the man of God there.
{9:11} They going up in the ascent of the city and they found girls going forth to draw water, and they will say to them, Is he seeing, here?
{9:12} And they will answer them and will say, He is; behold, before thee: hasten now, for this day he came to the city for a sacrifice this day to the people Bamah.
{9:13} As you come to the city thus ye shall find him, before he will go up to Bamah to eat: for the people will not eat till his coming, for he will bless the sacrifice; after this they being called will eat. And now go up, for this day ye shall find him.
{9:14} And they will go up to the city: they coming into the midst of the city, and behold, Samuel coming forth to meet them, to go up to Bamah.
{9:15} And Jehovah revealed in the ear of Samuel one day, before Saul came, saying,
{9:16} About the time to-morrow I will send to thee a man from the land of Benjamin, and anoint him for leader over my people Israel; he shall save my people from the hand of Philisteim; for I saw my people, for their cry came to me.
{9:17} And Samuel saw Saul, and Jehovah answered him, Behold the man that I said to thee, He shall rule over my people.
{9:18} And Saul will draw near to Samuel in the midst of the gate, and he will say, Announce to me, now, where the house of him seeing.
{9:19} And Samuel will answer Saul, and say, I the seeing: go up before me to Bamah, and eat with me this day, and I will send thee away in the morrow, and all that is in thy heart I will announce to thee.
{9:20} And for the asses lost to thee this day three days, thou shall not set thy heart upon them, for they have been found. And to whom all the desire of Israel? is it not to thee and to all thy father's house?
{9:21} And Saul will answer and say, Am not I a son of the Jaminite, from the littleness of the tribes of Israel, and my family small more than all the families of the tribes of Benjamin and wherefore spakest thou to me according to this word?
{9:22} And Samuel will take Saul and his boy, and will bring them to the chamber, and will give to them place among the first of those being called, and they about thirty men.
{9:23} And Samuel will say to the cook, Thou shalt give the portion which I gave to thee, which I said to thee, Put it with thee.
{9:24} And the cook will lift up the leg and that upon it, and will set before Saul. And he will say, Behold that being left set before thee: eat, for to the appointment being watched for thee, saying, I called the people. And Saul will eat with Samuel in that day.
{9:25} And they will go down from Bamah to the city, and he will speak to Saul upon the roof.
{9:26} And they will rise early: and it will be about the hind of the dawn, and Samuel will call to Saul to the roof, saying, Arise, and I will send thee away. And Saul will arise, and they two will go forth, he and Samuel without.
{9:27} They coming down to the extremity of the city, and Samuel said to Saul, Say to the boy, Pass over before us: and he will pass over: and thou stand according to the day, and I will cause thee to hear the word of God.
{10:1} And Samuel will take a flask of oil and pour upon his head, and he will kiss him and say, Is it not that Jehovah anointed thee for leader over his inheritance?
{10:2} In thy going this day from me and thou shalt find two men by the sepulchre of Rachel in the bound of Benjamin in Zelzah; and they said to thee, The asses were found which thou wentest to seek: and behold, thy father cast off the matters of the asses, and was afraid for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
{10:3} And pass on from thence and beyond, and thou camest to the oak of Tabor, there three men shall find thee going up to God, to the house of God, one lifting up three kids and one lifting up three rounds of bread, and one lifting up a skin of wine.
{10:4} And they asked thee for peace, and they gave thee two of bread, and thou receivedst from their hands.
{10:5} After this thou shalt come to the hill of God, where there Philisteim standing: and it will be when thou comest there to the city, and thou didst light upon a band of prophets coming down out of Bamah, and before them a lyre, and a drum, and a pipe, and a harp; and they prophesying.
{10:6} And the shout of Jehovah fell suddenly upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them, and be turned to another man.
{10:7} And it was when these signs shall come upon thee, do for thyself what thy hand shall find, for God is with thee.
{10:8} And go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I come down to thee to bring up burnt offerings, to sacrifice sacrifices of peace: seven days shalt thou wait till my coming to thee, and I made known to thee what thou shalt do.
{10:9} And it was as he turned away his shoulder to go from Samuel, and God will turn to him another heart: and all these signs will come in that day.
{10:10} And they will come there to Gibeah, and behold, a band of prophets to meet him; and the spirit of God will fall suddenly upon him and he will prophesy in the midst of them.
{10:11} And it will be all will know him from yesterday the third day, and will see him and behold, he prophesied with the prophets, and the people will say, a man to his neighbor, What was this to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
{10:12} And a man will answer from thence and will say, And who their father? For this it was for a parable, Is Saul also among the prophets?
{10:13} And he will finish prophesying and will come to Bamah.
{10:14} And Saul's friend will say to him and to his boy, Whither went ye? And he will say, To seek the asses; and we shall see that nothing, and we shall go to Samuel.
{10:15} And Saul's friend will say, Announce now, to me, what Samuel said to you.
{10:16} And Saul will say to his friend, Announcing, he announced to us that they found the asses; and the word of the kingdom he announced not to him, which Samuel said to him.
{10:17} And Samuel will convoke the people together to Jehovah at Mizpeh;
{10:18} And he will say to the sons of Israel, Thus spake Jehovah the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I will deliver you out of the hand of Egypt, and out of the hand of all kingdoms pressing you.
{10:19} And ye this day rejected your God who himself saves you from all your evils and your straits; and ye will say to him, That thou shalt put a king over us. And now stand ye before Jehovah by your tribes and by your thousands.
{10:20} And Samuel will cause all the tribes of Israel to come near, and the tribe of Benjamin will be taken.
{10:21} And he will cause the tribe of Benjamin to come near by his families, and the family of Matri will be taken, and Saul son of Kish will be taken: and they will seek and he was not found.
{10:22} And they will ask yet of Jehovah, Will the man yet come hither? And Jehovah will say, Behold, he hid himself among the vessels.
{10:23} And they will run and take him from thence, and he will stand in the midst of the people; and he will be high above all the people, from his shoulders and above.
{10:24} And Samuel will say to all the people, See whom Jehovah chose to him, for none like him among all the people. And all the people will shout and say, The king shall live.
{10:25} And Samuel will speak to the people the judgment of the kingdom; and he will write in a book and put before Jehovah. And Samuel will send away all the people, a man to his house.
{10:26} And also Saul went to his house at Gibeah; and there will go with him the army whom God touched their heart.
{10:27} And the sons of Belial said, What shall this save us? And they will despise him and will not bring him a gift; and he will be as keeping silence.
{11:1} And Nahash the Ammonite will come up and encamp against Jabesh-Gilead: and all the men of Jabesh will say to Nahash, Cut out to us a covenant, and we will serve thee.
{11:2} And Nahash the Ammonite will say to them, Upon this I will cut out to you in boring out for you every right eye, and I put it a reproach upon all Israel.
{11:3} And the old men of Jabesh will say to him, Let go to us seven days, and we will send messengers in every bound of Israel: and if none save us we will come forth to thee.
{11:4} And the messengers will come to the hill of Saul and will speak the words in the ears of the people: and all the people will lift up their voice and weep.
{11:5} And behold, Saul came after the cattle from the field; and Saul will say, What to the people that they will weep? and they will recount to him the words of the men of Jabesh.
{11:6} And the spirit of God will fall suddenly upon Saul in his hearing these words, and his anger will kindle greatly.
{11:7} And he will take a pair of oxen and will cut them in pieces, and will send in all the bound of Israel by the hand of the messengers, saying, Whoever will not come forth after Saul and after Samuel, thus shall be done to his oxen. And the fear of Jehovah will fall upon the people, and they will come forth as one man.
{11:8} And he will review them in Bezek, and the sons of Israel will be three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
{11:9} And they will say to the messengers coming, Thus shall ye say to the men of Jabesh-Gilead, To-morrow salvation shall be to you in the heat of the sun. And the messengers will come and announce to the men of Jabesh, and they will rejoice.
{11:10} And the men of Jabesh will say, To morrow we will come forth to you, and do to us air the good in your eyes.
{11:11} And it will be on the morrow, and Saul will put the people three heads; and they will come into the midst of the camp in the watch of the morning, and they will strike Ammon till the heat of the day: and there will be those being left and they will be scattered, and two among them were not left together.
{11:12} And the people will say to Samuel, Who said, Shall Saul reign over us? Ye shall give up the men and we will put them to death.
{11:13} And Saul will say, A man shall not die in this day, for this day Jehovah made salvation in Israel.
{11:14} And Samuel will say to the people, Go, and we will go to Gilgal, and we will renew there the kingdom.
{11:15} And all the people will go to Gilgal; and will sacrifice there sacrifices of peace before Jehovah: and Saul will rejoice there and all the men of Israel, even greatly.
{12:1} And Samuel will say to all Israel, Behold, I heard to your voice, to all that ye said to me, and I will make a king over you.
{12:2} And now, behold, the king going before you: and I grew old and I was gray-headed; and my sons, behold them with you: and I went before you from my youth even to this day.
{12:3} Behold me: answer against me before Jehovah and before his Messiah, whose ox did I take? or whose ass did I take? and whom did I oppress? whom did I vex? and from whose hand did I take a ransom and hidden mine eyes with it? and I will turn back to you.
{12:4} And they will say, Thou didst not oppress us, and thou didst not vex us, and thou didst not take any thing from man's hand.
{12:5} And he will say to them, Jehovah the witness against you, and his Messiah the witness this day that ye found nothing in my hand. And he will say, A witness.
{12:6} And Samuel will say to the people, Jehovah who made Moses and Aaron, and who brought up your fathers from the land of Egypt.
{12:7} And now, stand ye, and I will judge you before Jehovah, all the justices of Jehovah which he did with you and with your fathers.
{12:8} When Jacob came into Egypt, and your fathers will cry to Jehovah, and Jehovah will send Moses and Aaron, and they will bring forth your fathers from Egypt, and they will turn them back into this place.
{12:9} And they will forget Jehovah their God, and he will sell them into the hand of Sisera, chief of the army of Razor, and into the hand of Philisteim, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they will war against them.
{12:10} And they will cry to Jehovah, and say, We sinned, for we forsook Jehovah, and we shall serve the Baalims and Ashtaroth: and now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee.
{12:11} And Jehovah will send Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and he will deliver you from the hand of your enemies from round about, and ye shall dwell confidently.
{12:12} And ye will see that Nahash, king of the sons of Ammon, came against you, and ye will say to me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: and Jehovah your God your king.
{12:13} And now, behold the king which ye chose, which ye asked! and behold, Jehovah gave a king over you.
{12:14} If ye will fear Jehovah and serve him, and hear to his voice, and ye shall not rebel against the mouth of Jehovah, and ye shall be, also ye, and the king which reigned over you, after Jehovah your God.
{12:15} And if ye will not hear to the voice of Jehovah, and rebel against the mouth of Jehovah, and the hand of the Lord was against you and your fathers.
{12:16} Also now stand ye and see this great word which Jehovah does before your eyes.
{12:17} Is it not the harvest of wheat this day? I will call to Jehovah and he will give voices and rain; and know ye and see that your wickedness is great which ye did in the eyes of Jehovah to ask for you a king.
{12:18} And Samuel will call to Jehovah, and Jehovah will give voices and rain in that day: and all the people will be greatly afraid of Jehovah and Samuel.
{12:19} And all the people will say to Samuel, Pray for thy servants to Jehovah thy God, and we shall not die; for we added upon all our sins the wickedness to ask for us a king.
{12:20} And Samuel will say to the people, Ye shall not be afraid: ye did all this wickedness: but ye shall not turn aside from after Jehovah, and serve ye Jehovah with all your heart.
{12:21} And ye shall not turn aside: for after vanities which will not profit, and they will not deliver, for they are vanities.
{12:22} For Jehovah will not cast off his people on account of his great name, for Jehovah willed to make you to him for a people.
{12:23} Also I, far be it to me sinning against Jehovah ceasing to pray for you: and I taught you in the good and straight way.
{12:24} But fear ye Jehovah, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for see what he magnified with you.
{12:25} And if doing evil, ye shall do evil, also ye, also your king; ye shall perish.
{13:1} Saul the son of a year in his reigning; and two years he reigned over Israel,
{13:2} And Saul will choose to him three thousand from Israel; and two thousand will be with Saul in Michmash, and in the mount of the house of God, and a thousand were with Jonathan in the hill of Benjamin: and the remainder of the people he sent a man to his tent.
{13:3} And Jonathan will strike a garrison of Philisteim which is in the hill, and Philisteim will hear, and Saul will clang upon the trumpet in all the land, saying, The Hebrews shall hear.
{13:4} And all Israel heard, saying, Saul struck a garrison of rovers, and Israel became loathsome with the rovers; and the people will be convoked together after Saul to Gilgal.
{13:5} And the rovers were gathered together to war with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is upon the lip of the sea for multitude: and they will come up and encamp in Michmash, east of the House of Nothing.
{13:6} And the men of Israel saw that a strait to him, for the people were pressed; and the people will hide in caves, and in thorn-bushes, and in rocks, and in towers, and in pits.
{13:7} And the Hebrews passed over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. And Saul he yet in Gilgal, and all the people trembled after him.
{13:8} And he will wait some days according to the appointment which was of Samuel: and Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
{13:9} And Saul will say, Bring near to me the burnt-offering and the peace, and he will bring up the burnt-offering.
{13:10} And it will be when he finished to bring up the burnt-offering, and behold, Samuel came; and Saul went forth to his meeting, and to bless him.
{13:11} And Samuel will say, What didst thou? and Saul will say, Because I saw, that the people were scattered from me, and thou camest not at the appointment of days, and the rovers were gathered together to Michmash;
{13:12} And saying, Now the rovers will come down to me to Gilgal, and I entreated not the face of Jehovah: and I will contain myself, and will bring up a burnt-offering.
{13:13} And Samuel will say to Saul, Thou didst foolishly: thou didst not watch the commands of Jehovah thy God which he commanded thee; for now Jehovah prepared thy kingdom for Israel, even for ever.
{13:14} And now thy kingdom shall not be set up: Jehovah sought to him a man according to his heart, and Jehovah will command him for leader over his people, because thou didst not watch what Jehovah commanded thee.
{13:15} And Samuel will rise and will go up from Gilgal to the hill of Benjamin. And Saul will review the people being found with him about six hundred men.
{13:16} And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people found with them, dwelt in the hill of Benjamin: and the rovers encamped in Michmash.
{13:17} And he destroying will come forth from the camp of the rovers, three heads: one head will turn to the way of Ophrah, to the land of Shual:
{13:18} And one head will turn the way of the House of the Hollow; and one head will turn the way of the bound projecting over the valley of the hyenas of the desert.
{13:19} And an artificer will not be found in all the land of Israel: (for the rovers said, Lest the Hebrews shall make a sword or spear:)
{13:20} And all Israel went down to the rovers, to hammer each his plough-shares, and his coulter, and his axe, and his plough-shares.
{13:21} And there was a notching of mouths for the plough-shares, and for the coulters, and for the three-pronged, and for the axes, and for setting the goads.
{13:22} And it was in the day of battle, and a sword and spear were not found in the hand of all the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: and they will be found to Saul and to Jonathan his son.
{13:23} And a station of the rovers will come forth to the passage of Michmash.
{14:1} And it will be the day, and Jonathan son of Saul, will say to the boy lifting up his arms, Come, and we will pass over to the station of the rovers, which is from beyond this And to his father he announced not.
{14:2} And Saul dwelt in the extremity of the hill under the pomegranate which is in the precipice. And the people that were with him, about six hundred men.
{14:3} And Ahiah, son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod, son of Phinehas, son of Eli the priest of Jehovah in Shiloh, lifting up an Ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan went.
{14:4} And between the passages where Jonathan sought to pass through upon the garrison of the rovers, and the tooth of a rock from beyond this, and the tooth of a rock from beyond this; and the name of the one Bozez, and the name of the one Seneh.
{14:5} And the tooth of the one pressing from the north in front of Michmash, and the other from the south in front of the hill.
{14:6} And Jonathan will say to the boy lifting up his arms, Come, and we will pass over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: perhaps Jehovah will do for us: for no restraining to Jehovah to save by a multitude or by few.
{14:7} And he lifting up his arms will say to him, Do all that is in thy heart: turn for thyself; behold me with thee according to thy heart.
{14:8} And Jonathan will say, Behold, we pass over to the men, and we will disclose ourselves to them.
{14:9} If thus they shall say to us, Be still till our reaching to you; and we stood our lowest place, and we will not go up to them.
{14:10} And if thus they shall say, Come up upon us; and we went up: for Jehovah gave them into our hand; and this to us the sign.
{14:11} And they two will disclose to the garrison of the rovers; and the rovers will say, Behold, the Hebrews coming forth from the holes where they hid there.
{14:12} And the men of the garrison will answer Jonathan and him lifting up his arms, and they will say, Come up to us, and we will make a word known to you. And Jonathan will say to him lifting up his arms, Come up after me: for Jehovah gave them into the hand of Israel.
{14:13} And Jonathan will go up upon his hands and upon his feet, and he lifting up his arms after him: and they will fall before Jonathan; and he lifting up his arms, slaying after him.
{14:14} And the first blow which Jonathan struck, and he lifting up his arms, will be about twenty men in about half the furrow of a yoke of a field.
{14:15} And terror will be in the camp, in the field, and in all the people of the garrison: and the destroyers trembled, they also, and the earth will be moved; and it will be for the terror of God.
{14:16} And the watchman to Saul will see in the hill of Benjamin, and behold, the multitude melting away, and going, and fighting.
{14:17} And Saul will say to the people that were with him, Review now, and see who went from us. And they will review, and behold, not Jonathan and he lifting up his arms.
{14:18} And Saul will say to Ahiah, Bring near the ark of God. For the ark of God was in that day and the sons of Israel.
{14:19} And it will be while Saul spake to the priest, and the multitude which was in the camp of the rovers, and it went going and increasing: and Saul will say to the priest, Take back thy hand.
{14:20} And Saul will be convoked and all the people which were with him, and they will go even to the battle: and behold, the sword of a man will be against his neighbor, a very great confusion.
{14:21} And the Hebrews being to the rovers about yesterday the third day, who went up with them into the camp round about, and also they to be with Israel which were with Saul and, Jonathan.
{14:22} And every man of Israel being hid in mount Ephraim, heard that the rovers fled, and they will cleave together, also they after them in the battle.
{14:23} And Jehovah will save Israel in that day: and the battle passed over to the house of nothing.
{14:24} And the man Israel was pressed in that day: and Saul will curse the people, saying, Cursed the men who shall eat bread till the evening, and I was avenged of mine enemy. And all the people tasted not bread.
{14:25} And all the land came into a thicket; and honey will be upon the face of the field.
{14:26} And the people will come to the thicket, and behold, the honey went; and none putting his hand to his mouth, for the people will be afraid of the oath.
{14:27} And Jonathan heard not in his father's causing the people to swear: and he will stretch forth the extremity of the rod which is in his hand, and he will dip it in the droppings of the honey, and he will turn back his hand to his mouth, and his eyes will see.
{14:28} And a man from the people will answer and say, Thy father adjuring, adjured the people, saying, Cursed the man who shall eat bread this day. And the people were wearied.
{14:29} And Jonathan will say, My father troubled the land: see, now, that mine eyes saw, because I tasted a little of this honey.
{14:30} But if eating, the people ate this day from the spoil of his enemies which he found; for now was not the blow greater against the rovers?
{14:31} And they will strike the rovers in that day, from Michmash to the oak: and the people were greatly wearied.
{14:32} And the people will make to the spoil, and they will take sheep and oxen, and the young of oxen, and they will slaughter on the earth: and the people will eat upon the blood.
{14:33} And they will announce to Saul, saying, Behold, the people sinning against Jehovah to eat upon the blood. And he will say, Ye acted treacherously: roll to me this day a great stone.
{14:34} And Saul will say, Be ye dispersed among the people, and say to them, Bring near to me a man his ox, and a man his sheep, and slaughter here and eat; and ye shall not sin against Jehovah to eat with the blood. And all the people will bring near, each his ox in his hand this night, and they will slaughter there.
{14:35} And Saul will build an altar to Jehovah: this altar he began to build to Jehovah.
{14:36} And Saul will say, We will go down after the rovers by night, and we will plunder among them till the light of the morning, and we will not leave a man among them. And they will say, Do all the good in thine eyes. And the priest will say, We will draw near here to God.
{14:37} And Saul will ask in God, Shall I go down after the rovers? wilt thou give them into the hand of Israel? And he will not answer him in that day.
{14:38} And Saul will say, Draw near here all the corners of the people: and know and see in what was this sin this day.
{14:39} For Jehovah lives, having saved Israel, for if it is in Jonathan my son, for dying he shall die. And none from all the people answered him.
{14:40} And he will say to all Israel, Ye shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on one side. And the people will say to Saul, Do the good in thine eyes.
{14:41} And Saul will say to Jehovah the God of Israel, Give the truth. And Jonathan will be taken, and Saul: and the people will come forth.
{14:42} And Saul will say, Cast between me and between Jonathan my son. And Jonathan will be taken.
{14:43} And Saul will say to Jonathan, Announce to me what thou didst And Jonathan will announce to him and say, Tasting, I tasted with the extremity of the rod which was in my hand, a little honey, and behold, I shall die.
{14:44} And Saul will say, So will Jehovah do, and so will he add; for dying, thou shalt die, Jonathan.
{14:45} And the people will say to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who did this great salvation in Israel? Far be it: Jehovah lives if there shall fall from the hair of his head to the earth; for he did with Jehovah this day. And the people will let Jonathan go free, and he died not.
{14:46} And Saul will come up from after the rovers: and the rovers went to their place.
{14:47} And Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and he will fight round about against all his enemies, against Moab and against the sons of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the rovers: and in all which he will turn he will disturb.
{14:48} And he will do in strength, and he will strike Amalek, and deliver Israel from the hand of him plundering him.
{14:49} And the sons of Saul will be Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchisua; and the names of his two daughters, the name of the first-born, Merab, and the name of the small, Michal.
{14:50} And the name of Saul's wife Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the chief of his army, Abner, son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
{14:51} And Kish the father of Saul: and Ner the father of Abner, son of Abiel.
{14:52} And strong war will be against the rovers all the days of Saul: and Saul seeing every strong man and every son of strength, and he will gather him to him.
{15:1} And Samuel will say to Israel, Jehovah sent me to anoint thee for king over his people, over Israel: and now hear to the voice of the words of Jehovah.
{15:2} Thus said Jehovah of armies, I reviewed what Amalek did to Israel, how he set for him in the way in his going up out of Egypt.
{15:3} Now go and strike Amalek, and exterminate all which is to him, and thou shalt not spare to him; and kill from man even to woman, from child even to suckling, from ox and even to sheep, from camel and even to ass.
{15:4} And Saul will cause the people to hear, and he will review them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah.
{15:5} And Saul will come even to a city of Amalek, and he will lie in wait by the torrent.
{15:6} And Saul will say to the Kenite, Go, remove, go down from the midst of the Amalekites, lest I shall add thee with him; for ye did mercy with all the sons of Israel in their coming up out of Egypt And the Kenite will remove from the midst of Amalek.
{15:7} And Saul will strike Amalek from Havilah thy coming to Shur, which is upon the face of Egypt.
{15:8} And he will seize Agag, king of Amalek, living, and be exterminated all the people with the mouth of the sword.
{15:9} And Saul and the people will have pity upon Agag, and upon the good of the sheep, and the oxen and the double, and upon the lambs and upon all the good, and they were not willing to exterminate them: and every work despised and wasting away, they exterminated it.
{15:10} And the word of Jehovah will be to Samuel, saying,
{15:11} I lamented that I made Saul for king, for he turned back from after me, and my words he set not up. And it will kindle to Samuel, and he will cry to Jehovah all the night.
{15:12} And Samuel will rise early to meet Saul in the morning, and it will be announced to Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he sets up to him a hand, and he will turn round and pass over and go down to Gilgal.
{15:13} And Samuel will come to Saul: and Saul will say to him, Blessed thou of Jehovah: I set up the word of Jehovah.
{15:14} And Samuel will say, And what the voice of sheep in mine ear, and the voice of the oxen which I hear?
{15:15} And Saul will say, From the Amalekites they brought them; which the people had pity upon the good of the sheep and of the oxen in order to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God; and the rest we exterminated.
{15:16} And Samuel will say to Saul, Desist, and I will announce to thee what Jehovah spake to me by night. And they will say to him, Speak.
{15:17} And Samuel will say, Wert thou not little in thine eyes, thou the head of the tribes of Israel, and Jehovah will anoint thee for king over Israel?
{15:18} And Jehovah will send thee in the way, and he will say, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners Amalek, and fight against him even till ye consumed them.
{15:19} And wherefore didst thou not hear to the voice of Jehovah, and wilt clothe thyself with the spoil, and thou wilt do the evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
{15:20} And Saul will say to Samuel, That I heard to the voice of Jehovah, and I will go in the way which Jehovah sent me, and I will bring Agag king of Amalek, and I utterly destroyed Amalek.
{15:21} And the people will take from the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief devoted to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.
{15:22} And Samuel will say, Was it pleasing to Jehovah in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as to hear to the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to hear, above a good sacrifice, and to hearken, above the fat of rams.
{15:23} For the sin of divination, rebellion; and deceit, and the family gods of stubbornness. Because thou didst reject the word of Jehovah, and he will reject thee from being king.
{15:24} And Saul will say to Samuel, I sinned: for I passed by the mouth of Jehovah, and thy words: for I feared the people and I will hear to their voice.
{15:25} And now, take away now, my sin, and turn back with me, and I will worship to Jehovah.
{15:26} And Samuel will say to Saul, I will not turn back with thee, for thou didst reject the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah will reject thee from being king over Israel.
{15:27} And Samuel will turn about to go, and he will seize upon the wing of his upper garment, and it will rend.
{15:28} And Samuel will say to him, Jehovah rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and gave it to thy neighbor being good above thee.
{15:29} And also the glory of Israel will not lie, and he will not lament: for he not a man to lament.
{15:30} And he will say, I sinned this time; honor me now before the old men of my people, and before Israel, and turn back with me, and I worshipped to Jehovah thy God.
{15:31} And Samuel will turn back after Saul; and Saul will worship to Jehovah.
{15:32} And Samuel will say, Bring near to me Agag king of Amalek. And Agag will come to him, wavering: and Agag will say, Surely the bitterness of death was removed.
{15:33} And Samuel will say, As thy sword bereaved women of children, so of women shall thy mother be bereaved of children. And Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.
{15:34} And Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house of the hill of Saul.
{15:35} And Samuel will not add to see Saul, even to the day of his death: for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Jehovah lamented that he made Saul king over Israel.
{16:1} And Jehovah will say to Samuel, How long mournest thou for Saul, and I rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill thy horn with oil, and go; I will send thee to Jesse of the House of Bread, for I saw among his sons a king to me.
{16:2} And Samuel will say, How shall I go? and Saul hearing, and killing me. And Jehovah will say, Thou shalt take a heifer of the cows in thy hand and say, To sacrifice to Jehovah I came.
{16:3} And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will make known to thee what thou shalt do: and anoint to me whom I say to thee.
{16:4} And Samuel will do what Jehovah spake, and he will go to the House of Bread. And the old men of the city will tremble to meet him, and say, Thy coming peace?
{16:5} And he will say, Peace: to sacrifice to Jehovah I came: be ye consecrated and come with me to the sacrifice. And he will consecrate Jesse and his sons, and call for them to the sacrifice.
{16:6} And it will be in their coming, and he will see Eliab, and he said, Surely, before Jehovah his Messiah.
{16:7} And Jehovah will say to Samuel, Thou shalt not look upon his aspect or upon the height of his stature; for I rejected him: for not what man will see, for man will see with the eyes, and Jehovah will see at the heart.
{16:8} And Jesse will call for Abinadab, and he will cause him to pass by before Samuel. And he will say, Also this Jehovah chose not.
{16:9} And Jesse will cause Shammah to pass by. And he will say, Also in this Jehovah chose not.
{16:10} And Jesse will cause seven of his sons to pass by before Samuel: and Samuel will say to Jesse, Jehovah chose not in these.
{16:11} And Samuel will say to Jesse, Are these the whole of the boys? And he will say, The small was yet left, and behold, he fed among the sheep. And Samuel will say to Jesse, Send and take him, for we will not turn about till his coming here.
{16:12} And he will send and bring him. And he red, with beauty of eyes, and good of sight And Jehovah will say, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.
{16:13} And Samuel will take the horn of oil and he will anoint him in the midst of his brethren: and the spirit of Jehovah will cleave to David from that day and over. And Samuel will rise and go to Ramab.
{16:14} And the spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah terrified him.
{16:15} And Saul's servants will say to him, Behold now, an evil spirit of God terrifying thee.
{16:16} Will our lord now say to thy servants before thee, Seek out a man knowing to play upon the harp: and it was in the evil spirit of God being upon thee, and he playing with the hand and doing good to thee.
{16:17} And Saul will say to his servants, See, now, a man to me being good to play, and bring to me.
{16:18} And one of his boys will answer and say, I saw a son to Jesse of the House of Bread, knowing to play, mighty of strength, and a man of war, and discerning the word, and a man of figure, and Jehovah with him.
{16:19} And Saul will send messengers to Jesse, and he will say, Send to me David thy son who is with the sheep.
{16:20} And Jesse will take a heap of bread and a sack of wine, and one kid of the goats, and he will send by the hand of David his son to Saul.
{16:21} And David will come to Saul, and stand before him: and he will love him greatly; and he will be to him lifting up the arms.
{16:22} And Saul will send to Jesse, saying, David shall stand now before me, for he found grace in mine eyes.
{16:23} And it was in the spirit of God being upon Saul, and David took the harp and played with his hand, and it was refreshed to Saul, and it was good to him, and the evil spirit departed from him.
{17:1} And the rovers will gather together their camps for war, and they will gather together at Shocoth, which is to Judah, and they will encamp between Shocoth and between Azekah, in the end of Damim.
{17:2} And Saul and the man Israel were gathered together, and they will encamp in the valley of Elah, and they arranged the battle to meet the rovers.
{17:3} And the rovers standing on the mountain from hence, and Israel standing on the mountain from thence, and the valley between them.
{17:4} And there went forth a man of the sons of the camp of the rovers, Goliah his name, from Gath; his height six cubits and a span.
{17:5} And a helmet of brass upon his head, and a coat of mail of scales he put on; and the weight of the coat of mail five thousand shekels of brass.
{17:6} And brass fronts upon his feet, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.
{17:7} And the arrow of his spear as the beam of weavers, and the flame of his spear, six hundred shekels of iron. And he lifting up a shield went before him.
{17:8} And he will stand and call to the ranks of Israel, and say to them, Wherefore will ye come forth to arrange the battle? am not I of the rovers, and ye servants to Saul? select to yourselves a man, and he shall come down to me.
{17:9} If he shall be able to war with me and strike me, and we were to you for servants: and if I shall be able against him and strike him, and ye were to us for servants, and ye served us.
{17:10} And he of the rovers will say, I upbraided the ranks of Israel this day; ye shall give to me a man and we will fight together.
{17:11} And Saul will hear and all Israel, these words of him of the rovers, and they will be terrified and greatly afraid.
{17:12} And David, son of a man, that Ephrathite, of the House of Bread of Judah, and his name Jesse; and to him eight sons; and the man in the days of Saul went an old man among men.
{17:13} And three sons of Jesse, the great ones, going, went after Saul to war: and the names of his three sons which went in the war, Eliab the first-born and his second, Abinadab, and the third, Shammah.
{17:14} And David, he the small; and the three great ones went after Saul.
{17:15} And David went and turned back from Saul to feed his father's sheep at the House of Bread.
{17:16} And he of the rovers will draw near, the morning and the evening, and he will take a stand forty days.
{17:17} And Jesse will say to David his son, Take now to thy brethren an ephah of this parched grain, and this ten of bread, and run to the camp to thy brethren.
{17:18} And these ten cuttings of milk thou shalt bring to the chief of a thousand; and thou shalt review thy brethren for peace, and take their pledge.
{17:19} And Saul, and they, and every man of Israel, in the valley of Elah, warring with the rovers.
{17:20} And David will rise early in the morning, and will cast the sheep upon a watcher, and he will lift up and go as Jesse commanded him; and he will come to the track, and the army going forth to the array and they shouted in the war.
{17:21} And Israel will arrange, and the rovers, array to meet array.
{17:22} And David will cast the utensils from off him upon the hand of the watcher of the utensils, and be will run to the array, and will come and ask to his brethren for peace.
{17:23} And he speaking with them, and behold, a man of the sons came up, Goliah of the rovers, his name, from Gath, from the ranks of the rovers: and he will speak according to these words, and David will hear.
{17:24} And every man of Israel in their seeing the man, will flee from his face, and they will fear greatly.
{17:25} And the man Israel will say, Saw ye this man coming up? for to upbraid Israel he came up: and it was the man who shall strike him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give to him his daughter, and his father's house he will make free in Israel.
{17:26} And David will say to the men standing with him, saying, What shall be done to the man who shall strike this one of the rovers, and take away the reproach from Israel? for who this uncircumcised of the rovers? for he upbraided the ranks of the living God.
{17:27} And the people will say to him according to this word, saying, Thus it shall be done to the man who shall smite him.
{17:28} And Eliab his brother the great, will hear in his speaking to the men, and Eliab's anger will kindle against David, and he will say, Why this camest thou down? and upon whom didst thou cast those few sheep in the desert? I knew thy pride and the evil of thy heart, for in order to see the battle thou camest down.
{17:29} And David will say, What did I now? is this not the word?
{17:30} And he will turn round from his side to the front of another, and will say according to this word: and the people will turn back word as the former word.
{17:31} And the words will be heard which David spake, and they will be announced before Saul, and he will take him.
{17:32} And David will say to Saul, man's heart shall not fall on account of him; thy servant will go and fight with this one of the rovers.
{17:33} And Saul will say to David, Thou wilt not be able to go against this of the rovers to war with him, for thou a boy, and he a man of war from his youth.
{17:34} And David will say to Saul, Thy servant was feeding for his father among the sheep, and there came the lion and with the bear, and lifted up a sheep from the flock.
{17:35} And I went forth after him, and I smote him, and I delivered from his mouth: and he arose upon me and I seized upon his beard, and I struck him and killed him.
{17:36} Also the lion and the bear thy servant struck: and this uncircumcised of the rovers was as one of them, for he God, upbraided the ranks of the living.
{17:37} And David will say, Jehovah who delivered me from the hand of the lion and from the hand of the bear, he will deliver me from the hand of this rover. And Saul will say to David, Go, and Jehovah shall be with thee.
{17:38} And Saul will put his garments upon David, and give a helmet of brass upon his head, and put on him a coat of mail.
{17:39} And David will gird his sword over his garments and begin to go, for he tried them not And David will say to Saul, I shall not be able to go with these, for I tried them not And David will take them away from off him.
{17:40} And he will take his rod in his hand, and he will choose to him five smooth stones from the torrent, and he will put them in a vessel of the shepherds, which is to him, and in a sack; and his sling in his hand: and he will draw near to him of the rovers.
{17:41} And he of the rovers going, went and drew near to David; and the man lifting up the shield before him.
{17:42} And he of the rovers will look and will see David, and he will despise him, for he was a boy, and red, with a fair aspect.
{17:43} And he of the rovers will say to David, Am I a dog that thou camnest to me with rods? and he of the rovers will curse David by his gods.
{17:44} And he of the rovers will say to David, Come to me and I will give thy flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the cattle of the field.
{17:45} And David will say to him of the rovers, Thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield, and I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of armies, the God of the ranks of Israel, which thou didst upbraid.
{17:46} This day Jehovah will deliver thee into my hand; and I smote thee and took away thy head from off thee, and I gave the carcass of the camp of the rovers this day to the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the earth: and all the earth shall know that there is a God to Israel.
{17:47} And all this assembly shall know that not with sword and with spear Jehovah will save, for to Jehovah the battle, and he gave you into our hand.
{17:48} And it was when he of the rovers arose, and he will come and draw near to meet David, and David will hasten and run to the array to meet him of the rovers.
{17:49} And David will stretch forth his hand to the vessel and take from thence a stone and sling and strike him of the rovers into his forehead, and the stone will sink into his forehead; and he will fall upon his face to the earth.
{17:50} And David will be strong upon him of the rovers with a sling and with a stone, and he will strike him of the rovers and kill him, and no sword in David's hand.
{17:51} And David will run and stand upon the rover, and take his sword and draw it from its sheath, and kill him and cut off his head with it. And the rovers will see that their mighty one died, and they will flee.
{17:52} And the men of Israel and Judah will rise and shout, and pursue the rovers till thy coming to the valley, and even to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the rovers will fall in the way of the gates, and even to Gath, and even to Ekron.
{17:53} And the sons of Israel will turn back from pressing after the rovers, and they will plunder their camps.
{17:54} And David will take the head of the rover, and bring it to Jerusalem; and he put his utensils in his tent.
{17:55} And when Saul saw David going forth to meet the rover, he said to Abner, chief of the army, Whose son this boy, Abner? and Abner will say, Thy soul lives, O king, if I knew.
{17:56} And the king will say, Ask thou whose son this youth.
{17:57} And as David turned back from striking the rover, and Abner will take him and bring him before Saul, and the head of the rover in his hand.
{17:58} And Saul will say to him, Whose son thou, O youth? And David will say, Thy servant the son of Jesse of the House of Bread.
{18:1} And it will be as he finished to speak to Saul, and the soul of Jonathan was bound with the soul of David, and Jonathan will love him as his soul.
{18:2} And Saul will take him in that day and he gave him not to turn back to the house of his father.
{18:3} And Jonathan and David will cut out a covenant in his loving him as his soul.
{18:4} And Jonathan will strip off the upper garment which is upon him and will give it to David, and his garments, and even to his sword, and even to his bow, and even to his girdle.
{18:5} And David will go forth in all which Saul will send him, and he will be prudent: and Saul will set him over the men of war, and he will be good in the eyes of all the people, and also in the eyes of the servants of Saul.
{18:6} And it will be in their coming, in David's turning back from the striking of the rover, and the women will come forth from all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing to meet Saul the king, with drums and with gladness and with triangles:
{18:7} And the women will answer, playing, and they will say, Saul smote with his thousand and David with his ten thousands.
{18:8} And it will kindle to Saul greatly, and this word will be evil in his eyes; and he will say, They gave to David ten thousands and to me they gave thousands, and yet to him but the kingdom.
{18:9} And Saul will be wrong with David from that day and forward.
{18:10} And it will be on the morrow, and the evil spirit of God will fall upon Saul, and he will prophesy in the midst of the house: and David playing with his hand as the day to day: and a spear in Saul's hand.
{18:11} And Saul will lift up the spear, and say, I will strike against David into the wall And David will flee from before him twice.
{18:12} And Saul will be afraid from the face of David, for Jehovah was with him, and he departed from Saul.
{18:13} And Saul will remove him from him, and will set to him chief of a thousand; and he will go out and come in before the people.
{18:14} And David will be prudent in all his ways; and Jehovah with him.
{18:15} And Saul will see that he is prudent greatly, and he will be afraid of his face.
{18:16} And all Israel and Judah loved David, for he will go out and come in before them.
{18:17} And Saul will say to David, Behold, my daughter the great, Merab; her will I give to thee for wife; but be thou to me for a son of strength and fight the battles of Jehovah. And Saul said, My hand shall not be upon him, and the hand of the rovers shall be upon him.
{18:18} And David will say to Saul, Who am I? and who was my father's family in Israel that I shall be son-in-law to the king?
{18:19} And it will be in the time of giving Merab, Saul's daughter, to David, and he gave her to Adriel, the Meholathite, for wife,
{18:20} And Michal, Saul's daughter, will love David: and they will announce to Saul, and the word was straight in his eyes.
{18:21} And Saul will say, I will give her to him, and she shall be to him for a snare, and the hand of the rovers shall be against him. And Saul will say to David, In the second time thou shalt be son-in-law to me this day.
{18:22} And Saul commanded his servants, Speak to David in secret, saying, Behold, the king delighted in thee, and all his servants loved thee: and now be son-in-law of the king.
{18:23} And Saul's servants will speak in the ears of David these words. And David will say, Was it light in your eyes to be son-in-law to the king, and I a poor man and lightly esteemed?
{18:24} And Saul's servants will announce to him, saying, According to these words spake David.
{18:25} And Saul will say, Thus shall ye say to David, No delight to the king in a dowry, but in a hundred uncircumcisions of the rovers to be avenged of the king's enemies. And Saul purposed to cause David to fall into the hand of the rovers.
{18:26} And his servants will announce to David these words, and the word will be straight in David's eyes, to be son-in-law to the king: and the days were not filled up.
{18:27} And David will rise and will go, he and his men, and he will smite among the rovers two hundred men; and David will bring their uncircumcisions and they will complete them to the king, to be son-in-law to the king. And Saul will give to him Michal his daughter for wife.
{18:28} And Saul will see and know that Jehovah is with David, and Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.
{18:29} And Saul will add yet to be afraid from the face of David; and Saul will be an enemy with David all the days.
{18:30} And the chiefs of the rovers will go forth: and it will be whenever they went forth, David was prudent above all the servants of Saul: and his name will be very precious.
{19:1} And Saul will speak to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, to kill David. And Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted in David greatly:
{19:2} And Jonathan will announce to David, saying, Saul my father is seeking to kill thee: and at this time, watch now, in the morning, and dwell in secret and hide.
{19:3} And I will go forth and stand by the hand of my father in the field where thou art there, and I will speak of thee to my father; and what I shall see I will announce to thee.
{19:4} And Jonathan will speak good of David to Saul his father, and he will say to him, The king will not sin against his servant against David, for he sinned not against thee, and because of his doing good to thee greatly:
{19:5} And he put his soul in his hand and smote the rover, and Jehovah will make great salvation to all Israel: thou sawest and thou wilt rejoice; and wherefore wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to kill David gratuitously?
{19:6} And Saul will hear to the voice of Jonathan; and Saul will swear, Jehovah lives if he shall die.
{19:7} And Jonathan will call for David, and Jonathan will announce to him all these words. And Jonathan will bring in David to Saul, and he will be before him as yesterday the third day.
{19:8} And there will add to be war: and David will go forth and fight against the rovers, and will strike among them a great blow, and they will flee from his face.
{19:9} And the evil spirit of Jehovah will be upon Saul, and he will sit in his house, and his spear in his hand: and David playing with his hand.
{19:10} And Saul will seek to strike the spear into David and even into the wall: and he will slip away from the face of Saul, and he will strike the spear into the wall: and David fled, and he will escape in that night.
{19:11} And Saul will send messengers to the house of David to watch him, and to kill him in the morning: and Michel his wife will announce to David, saying, If thou save not thy soul this night, to-morrow thou diest.
{19:12} And Michal will let David down through the window: and he will go and flee, and escape.
{19:13} And Michal will take a teraphim and put into the bed, and put a braiding of goat's hair at its head, and will cover with a garment.
{19:14} And Saul will send messengers to take David, and she will say, He sick.
{19:15} And Saul will send the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up in his bed to me to kill him.
{19:16} And the messengers will come in, and behold, the teraphim in the bed, and the braiding of goats hair at its head.
{19:17} And Saul will say to Michal, Wherefore didst thou deceive me thus? and wilt thou send away mine enemy and he will escape? And Michal will say to Saul, He said to me, Send me away; why shall I kill thee?
{19:18} And David fled, and he will escape and will come to Samuel at Ramah, and he will announce to him all that Saul did to him. And he went, and Samuel, and they dwelt in Naioth.
{19:19} And it will be announced to Saul, saying, Behold, David in Naioth in Ramah.
{19:20} And Saul will send messengers to take David: and seeing the assembly of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing, being set up over them, and the spirit of God will be upon Saul's messengers, and they will prophesy, also they.
{19:21} And they will announce to Saul, and he will send other messengers, and they will prophesy, also they. And Saul will add and will send messengers the third time, and they will prophesy, also they.
{19:22} And he also will go to Ramah, and he will come even to the great pit which is in Sechu: and he will ask and say, Where Samuel and David? And it will be said, Behold, in Naioth in Ramah.
{19:23} And he will go there to Naioth in Ramah: and the spirit of God will be upon him, him also, and going, he will go and prophesy even till his coming into Naioth in Ramah.
{19:24} And he will also strip off his garments and prophesy, he also, before Samuel; and he will fall naked all that day and all the night. For this they will say, Is Saul also among the prophets.
{20:1} And David will flee from Naioth in Ramah, and he will come and say before Jonathan, What did I? and what mine iniquity? and what my sin before thy father that he seeks my soul?
{20:2} And he will say to him, Far be it; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will not do a word great or a word small, and not disclose mine ear: and wherefore will my father hide from me this word? this is not.
{20:3} And David will yet swear and say, Knowing, thy father knew that I found grace in thine eyes; and he will say, Jonathan shall not know this, lest he shall be grieved: but yet Jehovah lives and thy soul lives, for but a step between me and between death.
{20:4} And Jonathan will say to David, What thy soul will say, and I will do for thee.
{20:5} And David will say to Jonathan, Behold, the new moon to-morrow, and I sitting, shall sit down with the king to eat: and thou sentest me away and I was hid in the field till the evening of the third.
{20:6} If reviewing, thy father shall review me, and thou saidst, Asking, David asked of me to run to the House of Bread, his city; for a sacrifice of days there to all the family.
{20:7} If thus he shall say, Good; peace to thy servant; and if kindling, it shall kindle to him, know that evil was finished with him.
{20:8} And do thou mercy with thy servant; for into a covenant of Jehovah thou didst bring thy servant with thee: and if there is iniquity in me, do thou kill me; and wherefore wilt thou bring me even to thy father?
{20:9} And Jonathan will say, Far be it to thee: that if knowing, I shall know that evil was finished with my father to come upon thee, shall I not announce it to thee?
{20:10} And David will say to Jonathan, Who shall announce to me? or what if thy father shall answer thee harshly?
{20:11} And Jonathan will say to David, Come, and we will go forth to the field. And they two went forth to the field.
{20:12} And Jonathan will say to David, Jehovah, God of Israel when I shall search out my father about this time to-morrow, the third day, and behold, good to David, and I shall not then send to thee, and uncover thine ear.
{20:13} Thus shall Jehovah do to Jonathan, and thus shall he add; for it shall be good to my father with evil to thee, and I uncovered thine ear and sent thee away, and thou wentest in peace: and Jehovah will be with thee as he was with my father.
{20:14} And not only while yet I live and wilt thou not do the mercy of Jehovah with me, and I shall not die.
{20:15} And thou shalt not cut off thy mercy from my house, even forever: and not in Jehovah's cutting off the enemies of David a man from the face of the earth.
{20:16} And Jonathan will cut out with the house of David, and Jehovah sought out from the hand of David's enemies.
{20:17} And Jonathan will add to cause David to swear in his loving him; as loving his soul he loved him.
{20:18} And Jonathan will say to him, To-morrow the new moon: and thou wert reviewed, for thy seat will be reviewed.
{20:19} And the third day thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide there in the day of the work, and thou shalt sit by the stone of rolling:
{20:20} And I will shoot three arrows of the side, to send to me for a mark.
{20:21} And behold, I will send the boy: Go find the arrows. If saying, I say to the boy, Behold, the arrows from thee, and behold, take it: and come, for peace to thee, and not a word; Jehovah lives.
{20:22} And if saying thus to the young man, Behold, the arrows from thee, and forward; go: for Jehovah sent thee away.
{20:23} And the word which we spake, I and thou, behold, Jehovah between me and between thee forever.
{20:24} And David will hide in the field: and it will be the new moon, and the king will sit down to the bread to eat.
{20:25} And the king will sit upon his seat as from time to time, to a seat of the wall: and Jonathan will rise, and Abner will sit by Saul's side, and David's seat will be reviewed.
{20:26} And Saul spake not anything in that day, for he said, It is an accident; he is not clean; for he is not clean.
{20:27} And on the morrow, of the month the second, and David's place will be reviewed: and Saul will say to Jonathan his son, Wherefore came not the son of Jesse also yesterday, also this day to the bread?
{20:28} And Jonathan will answer to Saul, Asking, David asked of me even for the House of Bread:
{20:29} And he will say, Send me away now, for a sacrifice of the family to us in the city; and my brother he commanded me: and now if I found grace in thine eyes, I will slip away now and see my brethren. For this he came not to the table of the king.
{20:30} And Saul's anger will kindle against Jonathan, and he will say to him, Son of crooked rebelliousness, did I not know that thou choosest to the son of Jesse to thy shame and to the shame of thy mother's nakedness?
{20:31} For all the days which the son of Jesse lives upon the earth, thou shalt not stand, and thy kingdom. And now send and take him to me, for he is the son of death.
{20:32} And Jonathan will answer Saul his father and say to him, Wherefore shall he die? What did he?
{20:33} And Saul will lift up his spear against him to strike him, and Jonathan will know that it was finished from his father to kill David.
{20:34} And Jonathan will rise from the table in the heat of wrath, and he will not eat bread in the day of the month the second, for he was grieved for David because his father reproached him.
{20:35} And it will be in the morning, and Jonathan will go forth to the field to the appointment, David and a small boy with him.
{20:36} And he will say to the boy, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot The boy ran, and he shot the arrows beyond him.
{20:37} And the boy will go even to the place of the arrows which Jonathan shot, and Jonathan will call after the boy and say, Is not the arrow from thee and forward?
{20:38} And Jonathan will call after the boy, Be quick, hasten, thou shalt not stand. And Jonathan's boy will take up the arrows and come to his lord.
{20:39} And the boy knew not anything: but Jonathan and David knew the word.
{20:40} And Jonathan will give his utensils to the boy that is to him, and he will say to him, Go, bring into the city.
{20:41} The boy went, and David rose from the south side, and fell upon his face to the earth, and they will worship three times, and they will kiss each his friend, and they will weep, each with his friend, till David magnified.
{20:42} And Jonathan will say to David, Go for peace, for we sware, we two, in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will be between me and between thee, and between my seed and between thy seed, even forever.  And he will rise and go: and Jonathan came to the city.
{21:1} And David will come to Nob to Abimelech the priest: and Abimelech will tremble to meet David, and he will say to him, Wherefore thou thyself alone and no man with thee?
{21:2} And David will say to Abimelech the priest, The king commanded me a word, and he will say to me, A man shall not know any thing of the word for which I sent thee, and what I commanded thee: and the boys I showed to such a place a certain one.
{21:3} And now what is under thy hand? five of bread thou shalt give into my hand, or that being found.
{21:4} And the priest will answer David and say, No common bread under my hand, but there is consecrated bread; if the boys watched themselves only from women.
{21:5} And David will answer the priest and say to him, That truly woman was withheld to us for yesterday the third day, in my coming forth, and the vessels of the boys holy, and this way common, and truly if this day it shall be consecrated in the vessel.
{21:6} And the priest will give to him the holy, for there was not there bread except the bread of the face, being taken away from before Jehovah to put hot bread in the day of taking it.
{21:7} And a man there from the servants of Saul in that day, withheld before Jehovah; and his name Doeg, the Edomite, a powerful one of the shepherds which were to Saul.
{21:8} And David will say to Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand, spear or sword? for also sword and also utensil I took not into my hand, for the king's word was pressing.
{21:9} And the priest will say, The sword of Goliah the rover, whom thou didst strike in the valley of the oak, behold, it wrapped up in a garment behind the ephod: if thou wilt take it to thee, take, for no other beside it here. And David will say, None like it; thou shalt give it to me.
{21:10} And David will rise and flee in that day from the face of Saul, and he will come to Achish, king of Gath.
{21:11} And the servants of Achish will say to him, Is not this David king of the land? will they not answer to this in dances, saying, Saul struck against his thousands and David against his ten thousands?
{21:12} And David will set these words in his heart, and he will be afraid greatly of the face of Achish, king of Gath.
{21:13} And he will change his understanding in their eyes, and he will be foolish in their hand, and he will mark upon the doors of the gate, and his spittle will come down upon his beard.
{21:14} And Achish will say to his servants, Behold, ye will see the man raving: wherefore will ye bring him to me?
{21:15} Do I want mad men that ye brought this to rave to me? shall this come into my house?
{22:1} And David will go from thence and he will escape to the cave Adullam: and his brethren and all the house of his father will hear, and they will go down to him there.
{22:2} And there will gather to him every man being pressed and every man which to him a creditor, and every man bitter of soul; and he will be for chief over them: and there will be with him about four hundred men.
{22:3} And David will go from thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he will say to the king of Moab, My father will come forth now, and my mother with you, till I shall know what God will do to me.
{22:4} And he conducted them before the king of Moab: and they will dwell with him all the days David was in the fortress.
{22:5} And the prophet Gad will say to David, Thou shalt not dwell in the fortress; go, and come in for thyself to the land of Judah. And David will go and come to the thicket of Hareth.
{22:6} And Saul will hear, for David was known, and the men which were with him. And Saul will dwell in the hill under the tamarisk tree, in Ramah, and his spear in his hand, and all his servants standing over him.
{22:7} And Saul will say to his servants standing by him, Hear now, ye sons of my right hand; also to you all will the son of Jesse give fields and vineyards, to you all will he set chiefs of thousands and chiefs of hundreds;
{22:8} That ye were all bound together against me and none uncovering mine ear in my sons cutting out with the son of Jesse, and none of you was concerned for me and uncovered mine ear that my son raised up my servant against me to lie in wait as this day.
{22:9} And Doeg the Edomite will answer, and he being set over the servants of Saul, and he will say, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob to Ahimelech, son of Ahitub.
{22:10} And he will ask for him in Jehovah, and he gave to him provision, and the sword of Goliah the rover he gave to him.
{22:11} And the king will send to call Ahimelech, son of Ahitub the priest, and all his father's house, the priests which are in Nob: and all of them will come to the king.
{22:12} And Saul will say, Hear now, son of Ahitub. And he will say, Behold me, my lord.
{22:13} And Saul will say to him, Why were ye bound together against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in thy giving to him bread and a sword, and asking for him in God to rise up against me, to lie in wait as this day?
{22:14} And Ahimelech will answer the king and say, And who among all thy servants faithful as David, and son-in-law of the king, and he departed at hearing thee, and honored in thy house?
{22:15} This day did I begin to ask for him in God? far be it to me. The king shall not put upon his servant upon all the house of my father: for thy servant knew not a word upon all this, small or great.
{22:16} And the king will say, Dying, thou shalt die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
{22:17} And the king will say to the runners standing by him, Turn about and kill the priests of Jehovah, for their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not uncover his ear. And the king's servants would not stretch forth their hand to fall upon the priests of Jehovah.
{22:18} And the king will say to Doeg, Turn thou about, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite will turn about, and he will fall upon the priests and kill in that day eighty and five men lifting up a linen ephod.
{22:19} And Nob the city of the priests, he struck with the mouth of the sword, from man and even to woman, from child and even to suckling, and ox, and ass, and sheep, with the mouth of the sword.
{22:20} And one son to Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, and his name Abiathar, will escape and flee after David.
{22:21} And Abiathar will announce to David that Saul slew the priests of Jehovah.
{22:22} And David will say to Abiathar, I knew in that day that Doeg the Edomite was there, that announcing, he will announce to Saul, I was the cause to every soul of thy father's house.
{22:23} Dwell with me, thou shalt not fear: for who shall seek my soul will seek thy soul: for thou being watched with me.
{23:1} And they will announce to David, saying, Behold, the rovers fighting against Keilah, and they are plundering the threshing-floors.
{23:2} And David will ask in Jehovah, saying, Shall I go and strike against these rovers? And Jehovah will say to David, Go and strike against the rovers, and save Keilah.
{23:3} And David's men will say to him, Behold us here in Judah being afraid, and even more if we shall go to Keilah against the ranks of the rovers.
{23:4} And David will add yet to ask in Jehovah, and Jehovah will answer him and say, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I gave the rovers into thy hand.
{23:5} And David will go, and his men, to Keilah, and he will war against the rovers, and drive away their cattle, and strike against them a great blow. And David will save the inhabitants of Keilah.
{23:6} And it will be in the fleeing of Abiathar son of Ahimelech, to David to Keilah, he brought down an ephod in his hand.
{23:7} And it will be announced to Saul that David came to Keilah. And Saul will say, God sold him into my hand; for he was shut up, to come to a city of doors and bars.
{23:8} And Saul will summon all the people to war to go down to Keilah to press against David and against his men.
{23:9} And David knew that Saul was working evil against him; and he will say to Abiathar the priest, Bring near the ephod.
{23:10} And David will say, Jehovah God of Israel, hearing, thy servant heard that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah to destroy the city on account of me.
{23:11} Will the lords of Keilah shut me up in his hand? will Saul come down as thy servant heard? Jehovah God of Israel, announce now to thy servant Jehovah will say, He will come down.
{23:12} And David will say, Will the lords of Keilah shut me up and my men into the hand of Saul? And Jehovah will say, They will shut up.
{23:13} And David will rise, and his men, about six hundred men, and they will go forth from Keilah, and they will go wherever they will go. And it was announced to Saul that David escaped from Keilah; and he will cease to go forth.
{23:14} And David will dwell in the desert in fastnesses, and he will dwell in the mountain in the desert of Ziph. And Saul will seek him all the days, and God save him not into his hand.
{23:15} And David will see that Saul went forth to seek his soul: and David in the desert of Ziph in a thicket.
{23:16} And Jonathan, son of Saul, will rise and go to David to the thicket, and he will strengthen his hand in God.
{23:17} And he will say to him, Thou shalt not fear, for Saul's, my father's hand, shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be to thee for the second; and also Saul my father knew this.
{23:18} And they two will cut out a covenant before Jehovah: and David dwelt in the thicket, and Jonathan went to his house.
{23:19} And the Ziphites will go up to Saul to the hill, saying, Is not David hiding with us in the fastnesses in the thicket, in the hill of Hachilah, which is from the right of the desert?
{23:20} And now, according to all the desire of thy soul, O king, to come down, come down; and for us to shut him up into the hand of the king.
{23:21} And Saul will say, Blessed ye, by Jehovah; for ye had pity upon me.
{23:22} Go now, prepare yet, and know, and see his place where his foot shall be, who saw him there: for it was said to me being crafty, he will be crafty.
{23:23} And see ye, and know of all the hiding places where he will hide there, and turn back to me prepared, and I went with you: and it being if he is on earth, and I sought him in all the thousands of Judah.
{23:24} And they will rise and go to Ziph before Saul: and David and his men in the desert of Maon, in the sterile region to the right of Jeshimon.
{23:25} And Saul will go, and his men, to seek: and they will announce to David, and he will go down to the rock and dwell in the desert of the refuge. And Saul will hear and he will pursue after David in the desert of Maon.
{23:26} And Saul will go from the side of the mountain from hence, and David from the side of the mountain from thence: and David will be taking flight to go from the face of Saul; and Saul and his men surrounding upon David and upon his men to seize them.
{23:27} And a messenger came to Saul, saying, Hasten and come, for the rovers plundered upon the land.
{23:28} And Saul will turn back from pursuing after David, and he will go to meet the rovers: for this they called that place the Rock of Escapes.
{23:29} And David will go up from thence and dwell in the fastnesses of the Fountain of Goats.
{24:1} And it will be when Saul turned back from after the rovers, and they will announce to him, saying, Behold, David in the desert of Engedi.
{24:2} And Saul will take three thousand men chosen from all Israel, and he will go to seek David and his men upon the face of the rocks of the wild goats.
{24:3} And he will come to the sheepfolds upon the way, and there a cave; and Saul will come in to cover his feet: and David and his men dwelling in the sides of the cave.
{24:4} And David's men will say to him, Behold the day of which Jehovah spake to thee, Behold, I give thine enemy into thy hand, and do to him as it will be good in thine eyes. And David will rise and cut off the wing of the upper garment which is to Saul, secretly.
{24:5} And it will be after this, the heart of David will strike him because that he cut off the wing which is to Saul.
{24:6} And he will say to his men, Far be it to me from Jehovah if I shall do this word to my lord, to the Messiah of Jehovah, to stretch forth my hand against him, for he is the Messiah of Jehovah.
{24:7} And David will divide his men with words, and he gave them not to rise against Saul, and Saul rose up from the cave and went in the way.
{24:8} And David will rise up after him and will come forth from the cave, and he will call after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And Saul will look behind him, and David will bow down his face to the earth, and worship him.
{24:9} And David will say to Saul, Why wilt thou hear the words of man, saying, Behold, David is seeking thy hurt?
{24:10} Behold, this day thine eyes saw that Jehovah gave thee this day into my hand in the cave: and it was said to kill thee; and it had pity upon thee, and saying, I will not stretch forth my hand against my lord, for he is Jehovah's Messiah.
{24:11} And my father, see, also see, the wing of thy upper garment in my hand: for in my cutting off the wing of thine upper garment and I killed thee not, know and see that there is not in my hand evil and rebellion: and I sinned not against thee; and thou didst hunt my soul to take it.
{24:12} And Jehovah will judge between me and between thee, and Jehovah avenge me of thee: and my hand shall not be upon thee.
{24:13} As the ancient parable will say, Injustice will go forth from the unjust; and my hand shall not be upon thee.
{24:14} After whom did the king of Israel come forth? after whom pursuest thou? after a dead dog? after one flea?
{24:15} And Jehovah being for defender, and judge between me and between thee; and he will see and plead my cause, and he will judge me out of thine hand.
{24:16} And it will be as David finished speaking these words to Saul, and Saul will say, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul will lift up his voice and weep.
{24:17} And he will say to David, Thou art just above me, for thou didst reward me good and I rewarded thee evil.
{24:18} And thou didst announce to me this day that thou didst good with me; when Jehovah shut me up in thine hand and thou killedst me not.
{24:19} And if a man shall find his enemy and send him in the way well? and Jehovah will recompense thee well for this day what thou didst to me.
{24:20} And now, behold, I knew that thou wilt reign king, and the kingdom of Israel being set up in thy hand.
{24:21} And now swear to me by Jehovah if thou wilt cut off my seed after me, and if thou wilt destroy my name from my father's house.
{24:22} And David will swear to Saul. And Saul will go to his house, and David and his men went up upon the fortress.
{25:1} And Samuel will die; and all Israel will assemble together and lament for him, and bury him in his house in Ramah. And David will rise and go down to the desert of Paran.
{25:2} And a man in Maon and his work in Carmel; and the man very great, and to him three thousand sheep and a thousand goats: and he will be in shearing his sheep in Carmel.
{25:3} And the name of the man Nabal; and his wife's name Abigail: and the woman good of understanding, and beautiful of form: and the man hard and evil of works; and he as his dog.
{25:4} And David will hear in the desert that Nabal sheared his sheep.
{25:5} And David will send ten boys, and David will say to the boys, Go up to Carmel and come to Nabal, and ask to him in my name for peace.
{25:6} And say thus to him living, And peace with thee, and to thy house peace, and all which is to thee, peace.
{25:7} And now I heard that shearers were to thee: now the shepherds which are to thee were with us, we harmed them not, and not anything was missing to them all the days of their being in Carmel.
{25:8} Ask thy boys and they will announce to thee. And the boys will find favor in thine eyes, for upon a good day we come: wilt thou give now what thy hand shall find to thy servants, and to thy son David?
{25:9} And David's boys will come and will speak to Nabal according to all these words in David's name, and they will rest.
{25:10} And Nabal will answer David's servants, and say, Who is David? and who the son of Jesse? this day there were many servants breaking away a man from the face of his lord.
{25:11} And took I my bread and my water, and my slaughter which I slaughtered for my shearers, and gave to men whom I knew not from whence they are?
{25:12} And David's boys will turn about into their way, and turn back and come and announce to him according to all these words.
{25:13} And David will say to his men, Gird ye on, each his sword; and they will gird on each his sword, and also David will gird on his sword: and there will go up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred will sit down by the vessels.
{25:14} And one boy of the boys announced to Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers from the desert to bless my lord; and he will fly upon them.
{25:15} And the men were good to us exceedingly, and they harmed us not, and we missed not any thing all the days we went with them in our being in the field.
{25:16} They were a wall to us, also the night, also the day, all the days we were with them feeding the sheep.
{25:17} And now know and see what thou wilt do; for evil was finished against our lord and upon all his house: and he a son of Belial, from speaking to him.
{25:18} And Abigail will hasten and take two hundred of bread, and two flasks of wine, and five sheep done, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of dried grapes, and two hundred cakes of figs, and put upon asses.
{25:19} And she will say to her boys, Pass over before me; behold me coming after you. And she announced not to her husband Nabal.
{25:20} And it was she rode upon the ass, and came down in the hiding of the mountain, and behold, David and his men coming down to meet her; and she will meet them.
{25:21} (And David said, Surely in vain did I watch all which was to this one in the desert, and not any thing was missed from all which was to him; and he will turn back to me evil for good.
{25:22} Thus will God do the enemies of David and thus will he add if I shall leave from all which is to him till the light of the morning, him pissing against the wall.)
{25:23} And Abigail will see David, and will hasten, and will come down from the ass, and fall before David upon her face, and will worship him to the earth.
{25:24} And she will fall at his feet and say, In me, my lord, me the iniquity; and thy servant now will speak in thine ears, and hear the words of thy servant.
{25:25} Now my lord shall not set his heart to this man of Belial upon Nebel: for as his name, so is he: Nabal his name, and folly with him: and I thy servant saw not the boys of my lord which thou sentest.
{25:26} And now my lord, Jehovah lives and thy soul lives, for Jehovah withheld thee from coming by blood, and saving thy hand to thyself, and now thine enemies shall be as Nabal, they seeking out evil to my lord.
{25:27} And now this blessing which thy servant brought to my give it to the boys going at the feet of my lord.
{25:28} Lift up now, to the trespass of thy servant: for making, Jehovah will make to my lord a faithful house; for Jehovah fought the battles of my lord, and evil shall not be found in thee thy days.
{25:29} And a man will rise to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: and the soul of my lord was bound up in the bundle of lives with Jehovah thy God; and the soul of thine enemies he will sling out in the midst of the hand of the sling.
{25:30} And it was that Jehovah will do to my lord according to all the good which he spake concerning thee, and he commanded thee for leader over Israel;
{25:31} And this shall not be to thee for an obstacle and for a stumbling-block of heart to my lord, and to pour out blood gratuitously, and for my lord saving for himself: and the doing good of Jehovah to my lord, and remember thy servant.
{25:32} And David will say to Abigail, Blessed Jehovah the God of Israel who sent thee this day to meet me.
{25:33} And blessed thy discernment, and blessed thou who finished me this day from coming for bloods, and my hand saving for me.
{25:34} But yet Jehovah the God of Israel lives who withheld me from doing thee evil, for unless thou hastenedst and came to meet me, for if there was left to Nabal by the light of the morning him pissing against the wall.
{25:35} And David will take from her hand what she brought to him, and he said to her, Go up for peace to thy house; see, I heard to thy voice, and I will lift up thy face.
{25:36} And Abigail will go to Nabal; and behold, to him a drinking in his house as the drinking of a king; and Nabal's heart good with him, and he was intoxicated even greatly; and she announced not to him a word small and great till the light of the morning.
{25:37} And it will be in the morning in the wine coming forth from Nabal, and his wife will announce to him these words, and his heart will die in the midst of him, and he was for a stone.
{25:38} And it will be about ten days, and Jehovah will strike Nabal, and he will die.
{25:39} And David will hear that Nabal died, and he will say, Blessed Jehovah who plead the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and held back his servant from evil: and the evil of Nabal Jehovah turned back upon his head. And David will send and will speak with Abigail to take her to him for wife.
{25:40} And David's servants will come to Abigail to Carmel and will speak to her, saying, David sent us to thee to take thee to him for a wife.
{25:41} And she will rise and worship with the face to the earth, and say, Behold, thy servant for a servant to wash the feet of my lord's servants.
{25:42} And Abigail will hasten and rise, and ride upon the ass with five of her girls going at her feet; and she will go after David's messengers and she will be to him for a wife.
{25:43} And David took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also, they two, to him for wives.
{25:44} And Saul gave Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti, son of Laish, who was of Gallim.
{26:1} And the Ziphites will come to Saul to the hill, saying, Is not David hiding in the hill of Hachilah, upon the face of the desert?
{26:2} And Saul will rise and go down to the desert of Ziph, and with him three thousand men the chosen of Israel, to seek out David in the desert of Ziph.
{26:3} And Saul will encamp in the hill of Hachilah that is upon the face of the desert, upon the way; and David dwelt in the desert, and he will see that Saul came after him to the desert.
{26:4} And David will send spies, and he knew that Saul came for a certainty.
{26:5} And David will rise and come to the place where Saul encamped there: and David will see the place where Saul lay down there, and Abner son of Ner, chief of his army. And Saul lay down in the track, and the people encamping round about him.
{26:6} And David will answer and say to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai, son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai will say, I will go down with thee.
{26:7} And David will come, and Abishai, to the people by night; and behold, Saul lay sleeping in the track, and his spear pressed into the earth at his head: and Abner and the people sleeping round about him.
{26:8} And Abishai will say to David, God shut up this day thine enemy in thy hand: and now, I will strike him now with the spear, and into the earth once, and I will not repeat to him.
{26:9} And David will say to Abishai, Thou shalt not destroy him: for who stretching forth his hand against Jehovah's Messiah, and being innocent?
{26:10} And David will say, Jehovah lives, for shall not Jehovah strike him? or his day shall come and he died; or he shall go down in the war and perish.
{26:11} Far be it to me from Jehovah stretching forth my hand against Jehovah's Messiah: and now, take now the spear which is at his head, and the cruse of water, and we will go for ourselves.
{26:12} And David will take the spear, and the cruse of water at Saul's head, and they will go for themselves, and none saw and none will know, and none waking: for all of them were sleeping; for a deep sleep of Jehovah fell upon them.
{26:13} And David will pass over to the other side, and he will stand upon the head of the mountain from afar, and much place between them.
{26:14} And David will call to the people and to Abner son of Ner, saying, Wilt thou not answer Abner? and Abner will answer and say, Who thou calling to the king?
{26:15} And David will say to Abner, Art not thou a man? and who as thee in Israel? and why watched thou not to thy lord the king? for one of the people came to destroy the king thy lord.
{26:16} This word was not good which thou didst Jehovah lives for ye the sons of death, for ye watched not over your lord, over Jehovah's Messiah And now see where is the king's spear and the cruse of water which was at his head.
{26:17} And Saul will know David's voice, and he will say, Is this thy voice, my son David? and David will say, My voice, my lord the king.
{26:18} And he will say, Wherefore this my lord pursued after his servant? for what did I? and what evil in my hand?
{26:19} And now will my lord the king hear now the words of his servant? If Jehovah moved thee against me, he will smell a gift; and if the sons of man, cursed are they before Jehovah; for they drove me out this day from adjoining myself to the inheritance of Jehovah, saying. Go, serve other gods.
{26:20} And now my blood shall not fall to the earth from before the face of Jehovah; for the king of Israel came forth to seek one flea, as when the partridge will pursue in the mountains.
{26:21} And Saul will say, I sinned; turn back my son David: for I will no more, do to thee evil because that my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I was foolish, and I shall go very much astray.
{26:22} And David will answer and say, Behold the king's spear: and will one of the boys pass over and take it?
{26:23} And Jehovah will turn back to a man his justice and his truth; for Jehovah gave thee this day in hand, and I would not stretch forth my hand against Jehovah's Messiah.
{26:24} And behold, as thy soul was magnified this day in mine eyes, so shall my soul be magnified in the eyes of Jehovah, and he will deliver me from all straits.
{26:25} And Saul will say, to David, Blessed thou, my son David: also doing, thou shalt do, and also being able, thou shalt be able. And David will go to his way, and Saul turned back to his place.
{27:1} And David will say in his heart, Now shall I be added one day into the hand of Saul: nothing good to me but escaping, I will escape into the land of the rovers; and Saul despairing to seek me farther in all the bound of Israel: and I was saved out of his hand.
{27:2} And David will rise and pass over, he and six hundred men that are with him, to Achish, son of Maoch, king of Gath.
{27:3} And David dwelt with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each in his house, David and his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal, the Carmelitess.
{27:4} And it was announced to Saul that David fled to Gath; and he will no more add to seek him.
{27:5} And David will say to Achish, If now I found grace in thine eyes, will they give me a place in one city of the field, and I will dwell there: and why shall thy servant dwell in the city of the kingdom with thee?
{27:6} And Achish will give to him in that day Ziklag; for this Ziklag was to the kings of Judah, even to this day.
{27:7} And the number of days which David dwelt in the field of the rovers will be days and four months.
{27:8} And David will go up, and his men, and will plunder against the Geshurites and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: and behold, the inhabitants of the land which were of old thy going to Shur, and even to the land of Egypt.
{27:9} And David struck the land, and will not save alive a man and woman; and he took the sheep and oxen, and asses and camels, and garments, and he will turn back and come to Achish.
{27:10} And Achish will say, Did ye not plunder this day? and David will say, Upon the south of Judah, and upon the south of the Jerahmeelite, and to the south of the Kenite.
{27:11} And David will not preserve alive a man and woman to bring to Gath, saying, Lest they shall announce against us, saying, Thus did David, and thus his judgment all the days which he dwelt in the field of the rovers.
{27:12} And Achish will believe in David, saying, Becoming loathsome, he became loathsome with his people, with Israel; and he shall be to me for servant forever.
{28:1} And it will be in those days, and the rovers will gather their camps together for war to fight against Israel. And Achish will say to David, Knowing, thou shalt know that with me thou shalt go forth with the camp, thou and thy men.
{28:2} And David will say to Achish, For this thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Achish will say to David, For this I will set thee a watcher for my head all the days.
{28:3} And Samuel died, and all Israel will lament for him; and they will bury him in Ramah, and in his city. And Saul took away the necromancers and the wizards from the land.
{28:4} And the rovers will gather together, and will come and encamp in Shunem: and Saul will gather together all Israel, and they will encamp in Gilboa.
{28:5} And Saul will see the camp of the rovers, and he will fear and his heart will tremble greatly.
{28:6} And Saul will ask through Jehovah, and Jehovah answered him not, also in dreams, also in Lights, also in the prophets.
{28:7} And Saul will say to his servants, Seek out for me a woman, mistress of necromancy, and I will go to her and inquire of her. And his servants will say to him, Behold, a woman mistress of necromancy in the Fountain of Dor.
{28:8} And Saul will disguise himself, and will put on other garments, and will go, and two men with him, and he will come to the woman by night: and he will say, Divine to me now, by necromancy, and bring up to me whom I say to thee.
{28:9} And the woman will say to him, Behold, thou knewest what Saul did who cut off the necromancers, and the wizards, from the land; wherefore art thou laying snares for my soul to kill me?
{28:10} And Saul will swear to her by Jehovah, saying, Jehovah lives, if iniquity shall pierce thee upon this word.
{28:11} And the woman will say, Whom shall I bring up to thee? And he will say, Bring up to me Samuel.
{28:12} And the woman will see Samuel, and she will cry out, with a great voice: and the woman will say to Saul, saying, Why didst thou deceive me? and thou Saul.
{28:13} And the king will say to her, Thou shalt not fear: What sawest thou? And the woman will say to Saul, I saw gods coming up out of the earth.
{28:14} And he will say to her, What his form? And she will say, An old man coming up, and he covered with an upper garment. And Saul knew that he Samuel, and he will bow his face to the earth and worship him.
{28:15} And Samuel will say to Saul, Why didst thou disturb me to bring me up? And Saul will say, Distress to me greatly: and the rovers warring against me, and God departed from me, and he answered me no more, also by the hand of the prophets, also by dreams: and I will call to thee to make known to me what I shall do.
{28:16} And Samuel will say, Why wilt thou ask of me, and Jehovah departed from thee and he will be thine enemy?
{28:17} And Jehovah will do for him as he spake by my hand, and Jehovah will rend the kingdom from thy hand and give it to thy neighbor, to David.
{28:18} As thou heardst not to the voice of Jehovah, and didst not the anger of his wrath against Amalek, for this, Jehovah did this word to thee this day.
{28:19} And Jehovah will give also Israel with thee into the hand of the rovers; and to-morrow thou and thy sons with me, also the camp of Israel Jehovah will give into the hand of the rovers.
{28:20} And Saul will hasten and fall with the fulness of his stature to the earth, and he will fear greatly from the words of Samuel: also strength was not in him, for he ate not bread all the day and all the night.
{28:21} And the woman will come to Saul, and she will see that he trembled greatly, and she will say to him, Behold, thy servant heard to thy voice, and I will put my soul in my hand, and heard thy words which thou spake to me.
{28:22} And now, hear now, also thou to the voice of thy servant, and I will set before thee a bit of bread; and eat and strength will be in thee that thou shalt go in the way.
{28:23} And he will refuse, and say, I will not eat And his servants will press upon him, and also the woman, and he will hear to their voice. And he will rise up from the earth and sit upon the bed.
{28:24} And to the woman a calf of the stall in the house; she will haste and sacrifice it, and take flour and knead and bake it unleavened.
{28:25} And she will bring near before Saul, and before his servants; and they will eat, and rise and go away in that night.
{29:1} And the rovers will gather together all their camp to Aphek: and Israel encamping by a fountain which is in Jezreel.
{29:2} And the princes of the rovers passing over by hundreds and by thousands: and David and his men passing over at last with Achish.
{29:3} And the chiefs of the rovers will say, What these Hebrews? and Achish will say to the chiefs of the rovers, Is not this David, servant of Saul king of Israel, who was with me these days or these years, and I found nothing in him from the day of his falling till this day.
{29:4} And the chiefs of the rovers will be angry with him; and the chiefs of the rovers will say to him, Cause this man to turn back, and he shall turn back to his place which thou didst set him there, and he shall not go down with us in the war, and he shall not be to us for an adversary in the war: and with what shall this satisfy to his lord? is it not with the heads of these men?
{29:5} Is not this David which they will answer to him in dances, saying, Saul struck his thousands and David his ten thousands?
{29:6} And Achish will call for David and say to him, Jehovah lives, for thou wert straight and good in mine eyes, thy going out and thy coming in with me in the camp, for I found not evil in thee from the day of thy coming to me even to this day: and in the eyes of the princes thou art not good.
{29:7} And now turn back and go in peace, and thou wilt not do evil in the eyes of the princes of the rovers.
{29:8} And David will say to Achish, But what did I? and what didst thou find in thy servant from the day I was before thee, even to this day, that I shall not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
{29:9} And Achish will answer and say to David, I knew that thou art good in mine eyes as a messenger of God: but the chiefs of the rovers said, He shall not go up with us in the war.
{29:10} And now rise early in the morning and the servants of thy lord which came with thee: and ye rising early in the morning, and the light to you, and go.
{29:11} And David will rise early, he and his men, to go in the morning to turn back to the land of the rovers. And the rovers went up to Jezreel.
{30:1} And it will be in the going up of David to Ziklag, and his men, in the third day, and the Amalekites plundered to the south, and to Ziklag, and they will strike Ziklag and burn it with fire.
{30:2} And they will take the women captive who are in it: from small and even to great they slew not a man, and they will lead away and go to their way.
{30:3} And David will come, and his men, to the city, and behold, it burnt with fire, and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive.
{30:4} And David will lift up, and the people with him, their voice, and they will weep till power was not in them to weep.
{30:5} And the two wives of David were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
{30:6} And it will press upon David greatly, for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was bitter, each for his sons and for his daughters: and David will be strengthened in Jehovah his God.
{30:7} And David will say to Abiathar the priest, son of Ahimelech, Bring now near to me the ephod. And Abiathar will bring near the ephod to David.
{30:8} And David will ask in Jehovah, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I hedge it in? and he will say, Pursue: and hedging, thou shalt hedge in, and taking away, thou shalt take away.
{30:9} And David will go, and six hundred men which were with him, and they will come to the torrent of Bezor, and those remaining, stood.
{30:10} And David will pursue, he and four hundred men: and two hundred men will stand, which were faint from passing over the torrent of Bezor.
{30:11} And they will find a man, an Egyptian, in the field, and they will take him to David, and they will give to him bread, and he will eat; and they will give him water to drink;
{30:12} And they will give to him a piece of a cake of dried figs and two bunches of dried grapes: and he will eat and his spirit will turn back to him, for he ate not bread and drank not water three days and three nights.
{30:13} And David will say to him, To whom thou? and from whence thou? and the boy, the Egyptian, will say, I servant to a man, an Amalekite; and my lord left me because I was sick the the third day.
{30:14} We plundered the south of the Cherethite, and upon that to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and Ziklag we burnt with fire.
{30:15} And David will say to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this troop? And he will say, Swear to me by God if thou wilt kill me, and if thou wilt deliver me into the hand of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.
{30:16} And he will bring him down, and behold them spread out upon the face of all the earth, eating and drinking and keeping a festival, for all the great spoil which they took from the land of the rovers, and from the land of Judah.
{30:17} And David will smite them from the dawn and even to the evening to their morrow: and a man escaped not from them, except four hundred men of youth who rode upon camels, and they will flee.
{30:18} And David will deliver all that Amalek took: and David took away his two wives.
{30:19} And nothing was wanting to them from small even to great, and even to sons and daughters, and spoil, and even to all which they took to them: David turned back all.
{30:20} And David will take all the sheep and the oxen they drove before those cattle, and they will say, This David's spoil.
{30:21} And David will come to the two hundred men which were faint from going after David, and they will cause them to dwell by the torrent of Bezor: and they will come forth to meet David and to meet the people which are with him: and David will draw near to the people and will ask to them of peace.
{30:22} And every evil man will answer, and Belial, of the men who went with David, and they will say, Because they went not with me, we will not give to them of the spoil which we took away, except each his wife and his sons, and they shall lead and go.
{30:23} And David will say, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with what Jehovah gave to us, and he will watch us and give the troop coming against us into our hand.
{30:24} And who will hear to you for this word? for as the part of him going clown in the war, and so the part of him sitting by the vessels: together shall they divide.
{30:25} And it will be from that day and over, and he will set it for a law and for a judgment to Israel even to this day.
{30:26} And David will come to Ziklag, and he will send from the spoil to the old men of Judah, to his neighbors, saving, Behold, to you a blessing from the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah.
{30:27} To those in Bethel, and to those in south Ramah, and to those in Jattir,
{30:28} And to those in Aroer, and to those in Siphmoth, and to those in Eshtemoa.
{30:29} And to those in Rachel, and to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those in the cities of the Kenites,
{30:30} And to those in Hormah, and to those in Chor-Ashan, and to those in Athach,
{30:31} And to those in Hebron, and to all the places where David went about there, he and his men.
{31:1} And the rovers warred against Israel: and the men of Israel will flee from the face of the rovers, and they will fall wounded in mount Gilboa.
{31:2} And the rovers will stick fast to Saul and his sons; and the rovers will strike Jonathan and Abinadab and Melchisua, Saul's sons.
{31:3} And the war will be heavy to Saul, and the archers, men with the bow, will find him; and he will be greatly wounded from the archers.
{31:4} And Saul will say to him lifting up his arms, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised shall come and thrust me through and mock upon me. And he lifting up his arms would not, for he will fear greatly; and Saul will take the sword and will fall upon it.
{31:5} And he lifting up his arms will fear, for he saw Saul died; and he will fall, also he, upon his sword, and he will die with him.
{31:6} And Saul will die, and his three sons, and he lifting up his arms, also all his men in that day together.
{31:7} And the men of Israel will see, who are on the the other side of the valley, and who are on the other side of Jordan, that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul died and his sons, and they will leave their cities, and flee; and the rovers will come and dwell in them.
{31:8} And it will be on the morrow, and the rovers will come to strip the wounded, and they will find Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
{31:9} And they will cut off his head, and they will strip off his arms, and send into the land of the rovers round about, to announce good news to the house of their images and to the people.
{31:10} And they will put up his arms in the house of Ashtaroth: and his body they will hang up upon the wall of the House of Quiet.
{31:11} And the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead will hear concerning him what the rovers did to Saul,
{31:12} And they will rise, every man of strength, and go all night and take the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the walls of the House of Quiet, and come to Jabesh, and burn them there.
{31:13} And they will take their bones and bury under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and they will fast seven days.
