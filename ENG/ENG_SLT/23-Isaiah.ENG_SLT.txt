{1:1} The vision of Isaiah son of Amos which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
{1:2} Hear, ye heavens, and give ear thou earth, for Jehovah spake: for I caused to grow and lifted up sons, and they rebelled against me.
{1:3} The ox knew his possessor, and the ass his lord's stall: Israel knew not; my people understood not.
{1:4} Wo! sinful nation, a people heavy with sin, a seed doing evil, sons acting wickedly; they forsook Jehovah; they despised the holy one of Israel; they separated themselves backward.
{1:5} For what shall ye be yet struck? will ye add apostasy? every head for sickness, and every heart sick.
{1:6} From the sole of the foot and even to the head, no wholeness in it; a wound and bruise, and a fresh blow: they were not pressed out, and they were not bound up, and they were not softened with oil.
{1:7} Your land made desolate, your cities burnt with fire, your land before your strangers eating it up, and made desolate, as the overthrow of strangers.
{1:8} And the daughter of Zion was left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a field of cucumbers, as a city besieged.
{1:9} Unless Jehovah of armies left to us an escaping so small, we were as Sodom and we were made like to Gomorrah.
{1:10} Hear the word of Jehovah, ye leaders of Sodom: give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
{1:11} For what to me the multitude of your sacrifices? Jehovah will say: I was filled with the burnt-offerings of rams and the fat of fatlings; and I delighted not in the blood of bullocks, and of he lambs and of he goats.
{1:12} When ye shall come to be seen before me who sought this from your hand to tread my enclosure.
{1:13} Ye shall not add to bring gifts of iniquity; incense, this an abomination to me; the new moon and the Sabbath, the calling of the assembly; I shall not be able to bear vanity and restraining.
{1:14} Your new moons and your appointments my soul hated; they were for a burden upon me; I was wearied to lift up.
{1:15} And in the spreading forth of your hands I will hide mine eyes from you; also when ye shall multiply prayer I hear not: your hands were full of blood.
{1:16} Wash ye, cleanse yourselves: turn away evil from your doings from before mine eyes; leave off the evil;
{1:17} Learn to do good; seek out judgment, lead right the oppressor, judge the orphan, contend for the widow.
{1:18} Come now we will confute together Jehovah will say: if your sins shall be as deep scarlet, they shall be white as snow; if they shall be red as crimson, they shall be as wool.
{1:19} If ye shall be willing and hear, ye shall eat the good of the land.
{1:20} And if ye shall refuse and rebel, ye shall be eaten by the sword: for the mouth of Jehovah spake.
{1:21} How was the faithful city for a harlot! I filled with judgment; justice will lodge in her; and now they are killing.
{1:22} Thy silver was for dross, thy wine adulterated with water.
{1:23} Thy chiefs turning away, and associates of thieves: every one loving a gift and following recompenses: the orphan they will not judge, and the cause of the widow will not come to them.
{1:24} For this says the lord Jehovah of armies, the mighty one of Israel, Wo! I will take vengeance of mine adversaries, and I will avenge myself of mine enemies:
{1:25} And I will turn back my hand upon thee, end I will straiten thy dross according to pureness, and I will remove all thine alloy:
{1:26} And I will turn back thy judges as in the beginning, and thy counsellors as in the beginning: after this he shall call to thee, The city of justice, the faithful city.
{1:27} Zion shall be ransomed with judgment and her captivity with justice.
{1:28} Breaking the transgressing and the sinning together, and they forsaking Jehovah shall be finished.
{1:29} For they shall be ashamed of their mighty ones which ye desired, and ye shall blush for the gardens which ye chose.
{1:30} For ye shall be as an oak the leaf withering, and as a garden which there no water to it.
{1:31} And the strong was for tow, and his work for a spark, and they two were burnt together, and none quenching.
{2:1} The word which Isaiah son of Amos saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
{2:2} And it was in the last days, the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be prepared upon the head of the mountains, and lifted up above the hills; and all nations flowed to it.
{2:3} And many people went and said, Come, and we will go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us from his ways, and we will go in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.
{2:4} And he judged between the nations, and he will decide for many peoples: and they shall beat down their swords to plough-shares and their spears to pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, and they shall no more learn war.
{2:5} O house of Jacob, come ye, and we will go in the light of Jehovah.
{2:6} For thou didst cast out thy people the house of Jacob, for they were filled from the east, and practicing magic as the rovers, and they will strike hands with the children of strangers.
{2:7} And their land shall be full of silver and gold, and no end to their treasures; and their land shall be full of horses, and no end to their chariots.
{2:8} And their land will be full of nothings; they will worship to the work of their hand, to what their fingers made:
{2:9} And man will bow down, and a man will humble himself, and thou shalt not lift up to them.
{2:10} Go into the rock, and hide in the dust from the face of the fear of Jehovah, and from the splendor of his majesty.
{2:11} The lofty eyes of man were humbled, and the height of men bowed down, and Jehovah alone was exalted in that day.
{2:12} For the day to Jehovah of armies is upon all the haughty and the high, and upon all lifted up; and he was humbled:
{2:13} And upon all the cedars of Lebanon being high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,
{2:14} And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills being lifted up,
{2:15} And upon every lofty tower, and upon every fortified wall,
{2:16} And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all the flags of desire.
{2:17} And the haughtiness of man was bowed down, and the height of man was humbled: and Jehovah alone was exalted in that day.
{2:18} And the nothings he shall cause to wholly pass away.
{2:19} And they shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the caverns of the dust, from the face of the fear of Jehovah, and from the splendor of his majesty in his rising to terrify the earth.
{2:20} In that day man shall cast the nothings of his silver and the nothings of his gold which they made for him to worship, to the digging of moles and to bats.
{2:21} To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the fissures of the rocks from the face of the fear of Jehovah, and from the splendor of his majesty in his rising to terrify the earth.
{2:22} Cease to you from man of whom the breath is in his nose: for in what was he reckoned?
{3:1} For behold, the Lord Jehovah of armies taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay, and the stay, all the stay of bread, and all the stay of water.
{3:2} The strong one and the man of war, the judge and the prophet, and the divines, and the old man,
{3:3} The captain of fifty and the elevated of face, and the counselor, and the wise of the artificers, and the intelligent one enchanting.
{3:4} And I gave boys their chiefs, and the petulant shall rule over them.
{3:5} And the people were pressed, man by man, and a man by his neighbor: the boy shall enlarge himself against the old man and the despised against the honorable.
{3:6} For a man shall seize upon his brother of the house of his father, A garment to thee, thou shalt be chief to us, this ruin under thy hand:
{3:7} He shall lift up in that day, saying, I will not be binding up; and in my house no bread and no garment: thou shalt not set me a chief of the people.
{3:8} For Jerusalem was weak, and Judah fell: for their tongues and their doings are against Jehovah to embitter the eyes of his glory.
{3:9} The withdrawing of their face answered against them; and they announced their sins as Sodom, and they covered not. Wo to their soul! for they rewarded evil to themselves.
{3:10} Say to the just, that it is good that they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
{3:11} Wo to the unjust! evil! for the reward of his hands shall be done to him.
{3:12} My people, their tyrants from children, and women ruled over them. My people, they calling thee happy, causing to err; they destroyed the way of thy paths.
{3:13} Jehovah stood up to contend and he stood to judge the peoples.
{3:14} Jehovah will go into judgment with the old men of his people and his chiefs: and ye burnt up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.
{3:15} Why will ye crush my people and grind the faces of the poor? says the Lord Jehovah of armies.
{3:16} And Jehovah will say, Because the daughters of Zion were lifted up, and they will go extending the neck and ogling their eyes, going and tripping their going, and binding back their feet:
{3:17} And Jehovah made bald the crown of the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah opened the redundance.
{3:18} In that day Jehovah will turn away the ornament of the ankle bands, and the inter-weavings, and the crescents,
{3:19} The drops, and the chains, and the veils,
{3:20} The head-dresses and the step chains, and the girdles, and the houses of the soul, and the amulets.
{3:21} The signet rings and the rings of the nose.
{3:22} The costly garments and the cloaks, and the mantles, and the caskets.
{3:23} The mirrors and the shirts and the turbans and the veils.
{3:24} And it was instead of a sweet smell there shall be rottenness, and instead of a girdle, a rope, and instead of turned work, baldness, and instead of a variegated garment, a girding of sackcloth a brand instead of beauty.
{3:25} Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy strength in the war.
{3:26} And her entrances sighed and mourned; and being clean, she shall sit upon the earth.
{4:1} And seven women shall lay hold upon one man in that day, saying, We will eat our bread, and we will be clothed with our garments: only thy name shall be called upon us to take away our reproach.
{4:2} In that day shall the springing up of Jehovah be for beauty and for glory, and the fruit of the earth for majesty and for ornament, for the escaping of Israel.
{4:3} And it was he being left in Zion and he remaining in Jerusalem, he shall say to him holy, all being written for their life in Jerusalem.
{4:4} When Jehovah washed out the excrements of the daughters of Zion, and he shall cleanse the blood of Jerusalem from her midst with the spirit of judgment, and with the spirit of burning.
{4:5} And Jehovah created upon all the foundation of mount Zion and upon all her convocation, a cloud by day, and smoke, and the shining of afire of flame by night: and upon all the glory a covering.
{4:6} And a booth shall be for a shadow by day from heat, and for a refuge, and for a hiding place from the storm, and from rain.
{5:1} I will sing now to my beloved a song of my love for his vineyard. There was a vineyard to my beloved in the horn of the son of oil:
{5:2} And he will dig it up, and he will free it from stones, and he will plant it with a vine of purple grapes, and build a tower in its midst, and he will also hew out a wine-vat in it: and he will wait for grapes to be made, and it will make wild grapes.
{5:3} And now, ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge ye now, between me and between my vineyard.
{5:4} What to do more to my vineyard, and did I not in it? wherefore I waited for grapes to be made, and it will make wild grapes.
{5:5} And now I will make known to you now what I do to my vineyard, taking away its hedge, and it was for consuming, breaking down its wall, and it was for a treading down.
{5:6} And I will make it a desolation; it shall not be pruned and it shall not be dressed, and there came up sharp points and thorns: and upon the clouds I will command from raining rain upon it.
{5:7} For the vineyard of Jehovah of armies is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah the plant of his pleasures: and he will wait for judgment, and behold bloodshed; for justice, and behold a cry.
{5:8} Wo to those touching house upon house, they will bring near field upon field, till no more place, and ye dwelt yourselves alone in the midst of the earth.
{5:9} In the ears of Jehovah of armies, If not many houses shall be for desolation, great and good from none dwelling.
{5:10} For ten measures of a vineyard shall make one bath, and the seed of an omer shall make an ephah.
{5:11} Wo to those rising early in the morning, they will follow strong drink; remaining in the evening, wine will inflame them.
{5:12} And there was the harp and the lyre, the drum and the pipe, and the wine of their drinking's: but the work of Jehovah they will not look at, and the work of his hands they saw not.
{5:13} For this my people were carried into exile from not knowing; and their honor, men of famine, and their multitude dry with thirst.
{5:14} For this, hades enlarged her soul, and opened wide her mouth without bound: and her honor shall go down, and her multitude, and her tumult, and he rejoicing, into her.
{5:15} And man shall bow down, and man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the haughty shall be humbled.
{5:16} And Jehovah of armies shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy God consecrated in justice.
{5:17} And the lambs feed according to their word, and the deserts of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
{5:18} Wo to those drawing iniquity with cords of evil, and sin as the cords of a wagon:
{5:19} Saying, He shall hasten, he shall urge on his work, so that we shall see: and the counsel of the holy one of Israel shall draw near and come and we shall know.
{5:20} Wo to those saying, to evil, good, and to the good, evil; putting darkness for light, and light for darkness; putting bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitten.
{5:21} Wo to the wise in their eyes, and knowing before their face.
{5:22} Wo to the strong to drink wine, and men of strength to mix strong drink:
{5:23} Justifying the unjust on account of a gift, and they will take away the justice of the just from him.
{5:24} For this as the tongue of fire consumes the straw, and the dry grass of flame will collapse: their root shall be as rottenness, and their flower shall go up as dust: for they rejected the law of Jehovah of armies, and the saying of the Holy One of Israel they despised.
{5:25} For this the anger of Jehovah was kindled against his people, and he will stretch forth his hand against them and strike them: and the mountains will be moved and their carcasses shall be as dung in the midst of the streets. In all this his anger was not turned back, and his hand was yet stretched out.
{5:26} And he lifted up a signal to the nations from far off, and he hissed to them from the extremity of the earth; and behold, they shall come swift from haste.
{5:27} None fainted, and none were weak among them; none shall slumber and none shall sleep; and the girdle of their loins was not loosed, and the thong of their shoes was not broken:
{5:28} Whose arrows were sharpened, and all their bows bent, the hoofs of their horses were reckoned as the rock, and their wheels as the whirlwind.
{5:29} The roaring to him as the lion, and he roared as the young lions: and they shall groan and shall lay hold of the prey, and it shall escape, and none delivering.
{5:30} And they shall groan against them in that day as the groaning of the sea: and they looked to the land and, behold, straitened darkness, and the light darkened in its clouds.
{6:1} In the year king Uzziah died, and I shall see Jehovah sitting upon his throne, high and lifted up, and his train filling the temple.
{6:2} And seraphs standing from above to it; six wings, six wings to one; with two he will cover his face, and with two he will cover his feet, and with two he will fly.
{6:3} And this called to this, and said, Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of armies: all the earth full of his glory.
{6:4} The foundations of the thresholds will tremble from the voice calling, and the house will be filled with smoke.
{6:5} And saying, Wo to me! for I was cut off; because I a man of unclean lips, and in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell: for mine eyes saw the king, Jehovah of armies.
{6:6} And one from the seraphs will fly to me, and in his hand a hot stone, he took with the tongs from off the altar:
{6:7} And he will touch upon my mouth, and say, Behold, this touched upon thy lips; and took away thine iniquity, and thy sin shall be covered.
{6:8} And I shall hear the voice of Jehovah, saying, Whom shall I send, and who shall go for us? and behold me saying, Send me.
{6:9} And he will say, Go, and say to this people, Hearing, hear ye, and ye shall not understand; and seeing, see ye, and ye shall not know.
{6:10} Make the heart of this people fat and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes, lest they shall see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and their heart shall understand and turn back and be healed to them.
{6:11} And saying, How long, O Lord? And he will say, Till when the cities were laid waste from not being inhabited, and the houses from not a man, and the land shall be laid waste with desolation.
{6:12} And Jehovah put man far away, and much forsaking in the midst of the land.
{6:13} And yet in it a tenth, and it turned back, and it was for consuming, as the terebinth and as the oak which in casting the trunk in them the holy seed its pillar.
{7:1} And it will be in the days of Ahaz son of Jotham son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin, king of Aram came up, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, to Jerusalem, to war against her, and he was not able to fight against her.
{7:2} And it will be announced to the house of David, saying, Aram rested upon Ephraim; and his heart will move to and fro and the heart of his people, as the woods of the forest moved from the face of the wind.
{7:3} And Jehovah will say to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou and Shear-Jashub thy son, at the extremity of the channel of the highest pool of the highway, of the fuller's field;
{7:4} And say to him, Watch and rest; thou shalt not fear, and thy heart shall not be tender from the two tails of these smoking fire-brands, upon the heat of anger of Rezin and Aram, and the son of Remaliah.
{7:5} Because Aram, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, will counsel evil against thee, saying,
{7:6} We will go up against Judah and terrify her and subdue her for us, and we will make a king in the midst of her, the son of Tabeal:
{7:7} Thus said the Lord Jehovah, It shall not stand, and it shall not be.
{7:8} For the head of Aram, Damascus, and the head of Damascus, Rezin, and in yet sixty and five years Ephraim shall be broken from a people.
{7:9} And the head of Ephraim, Shomeron, and the head of Shomeron, the son of Remaliah. If ye will not believe, because ye will not believe.
{7:10} And Jehovah will add to speak to Ahaz, saying,
{7:11} Ask for thee a sign from Jehovah thy God; make deep the asking, or make high upwards.
{7:12} And Ahaz will say, I will not ask and I will not tempt Jehovah.
{7:13} And he will say, Hear ye now, house of David; is it small for you to weary men, but will ye weary God also.
{7:14} For this, Jehovah he will give to you a sign Behold, the virgin conceiving, and she will bare a son, and call his name Immanuel.
{7:15} Curdled milk and honey he shall eat, for his knowing to reject in evil, and to choose in good.
{7:16} For before the boy shall know to reject in evil and to choose in good the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken from the face of its two kings.
{7:17} Jehovah shall bring upon thee and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days which came not, from the day Ephraim turned away from Judah; the king of Assur.
{7:18} And it was in that day Jehovah shall hiss for the fly which is in the extremity of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of Assur.
{7:19} And they shall come and rest all of them in the valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and in all the thorn hedges, and in all pastures.
{7:20} In that day shall Jehovah shave with a hired razor by those beyond the river, by the king of Assur, the head and the hair of the feet: and it also shall scrape off the beard.
{7:21} And it was in, that day a man shall preserve alive a heifer of the herd, and two sheep.
{7:22} And it was from the abundance of making milk he shall eat curdled milk; for curdled milk and honey shall eat all they being left in the midst of the land.
{7:23} And it was in that day every place shall be where shall be there a thousand vines for a thousand of silver, for sharp points and thorns shall it be.
{7:24} With arrows and with bows shall he come there: for sharp points and thorns shall be all the land.
{7:25} And all the mountains which shall be dressed with the hoe, the fear of sharp points and thorns shall not come there: and it was for the sending forth of the ox and for the treading of sheep.
{8:1} And Jehovah will say to me, Take to thee a great tablet, and write upon it with a man's graving tool to hasten the spoil, urging on the plunder.
{8:2} I will take to witness to me faithful witnesses, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah.
{8:3} And I shall draw near to the prophetess; and she will conceive and bear a son, and Jehovah will say to me, Call his name, Hastening the spoil, urging on the plunder.
{8:4} For before the boy shall know to call, My father and my mother, he shall lift up the strength of Damascus and the spoil of Shomeron before the king of Assur.
{8:5} And Jehovah will add yet to speak to me, saying,
{8:6} Because this people rejected the water of Shiloh, going softly and rejoicing in Rezin and the son of Remaliah;
{8:7} And for this, behold Jehovah bringing up upon them the water of the river, strong and many, the king of Assur and his glory: and he came up over all his channels and he went over all his banks.
{8:8} And he went in Judah; and he overflowed and passed through; he will reach even to the neck; and the expansion of his wings was the fulness of the land, God with us.
{8:9} Make friendship, ye peoples, and be broken in pieces; and give ear, every land from afar; be girded and be broken in pieces; be girded and be broken in pieces.
{8:10} Counsel ye, counsel, and it shall be dispersed; speak the word and it shall not stand: for God is with us.
{8:11} For thus said Jehovah to me with strength of the hand, and he will turn me away from going in the way of this people, saying,
{8:12} Ye shall not say, A conspiracy to all whom this people shall say a conspiracy; and ye shall not fear their fear, and ye shall not be afraid.
{8:13} Jehovah of armies, him shall ye consecrate; and he your fear, and he your terror.
{8:14} And he was for a holy place and for a stone of striking, and for a rock of falling to the two houses of Israel; for a trap net and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
{8:15} And many fainted among them and fell, and were broken, and snared, and taken.
{8:16} Bind up the oracle, seal up the law among the disciples.
{8:17} And I waited for Jehovah in his hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I trusted to him.
{8:18} Behold me and the children which Jehovah gave to me for signs and for wonders in Israel from Jehovah of armies dwelling in mount Zion.
{8:19} And when they shall say to you, Seek ye to necromancers and to wizards peeping and panting: shall not a people seek their God among the living for the dead?
{8:20} To the law and to the testimony if they will not speak according to this word, because no morning is in them.
{8:21} And passing through it, harshly oppressed and hungry; and it was when he shall be hungry, and they brake forth and cursed against their king and their God, and looked upwards.
{8:22} And they shall look to the earth, and behold, straits and darkness and fainting of distress; and to darkness being removed.
{9:1} For the fainting not to what the straits to her according to the time of the first he made light the land of Zebulon and the land of Naphtali; and afterward he made heavy the way of the sea beyond Jordan of Galilee of the nations.
{9:2} The people going in darkness saw a great light: they dwelling in the land of the shadow of death, light shone upon them.
{9:3} Thou didst multiply the nation, thou didst not increase the joy: they rejoiced before thee according to the joy in harvest as they will exalt in their dividing the spoil.
{9:4} For the yoke of his burden and the rod of his shoulder, and the rod of him oppressing with it thou didst break in pieces the day of Midian.
{9:5} For every shoe of the shod with trembling, and a garment being rolled in bloods; and it was for burning the food of fire.
{9:6} For a child was born to us, a son was given to us, and the dominion shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, everlasting Father, Captain of Peace.
{9:7} To the increase of his dominion and to peace no end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to prepare it and to support it in judgment and in justice from now and even to forever: the zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.
{9:8} Jehovah sent a word into Jacob, and it fell upon Israel.
{9:9} And the people shall know, all they of Ephraim and the inhabitants of Shomeron, in pride and in greatness of heart, saying,
{9:10} The bricks fell, and we will build with hewn stone: the sycamores were cut down, and the cedars we will renew.
{9:11} And Jehovah will set on high the adversaries of Rezin against him, and he will arouse his enemies:
{9:12} Aram from the east, and the rovers from behind; and they will eat up Israel with all the mouth. In all this his anger was not turned back, and yet his hand stretched out.
{9:13} And the people turned not back even to him smiting them, and Jehovah of armies they sought not.
{9:14} And Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm branch and reed in one day.
{9:15} The old man and they lifting up faces, he the head; and the prophet teaching falsehood, be the tail.
{9:16} And there will be those leading this people causing them to wander; and those being led being swallowed up.
{9:17} For this upon their young men Jehovah shall not rejoice, and their orphans and their widows he will not compassionate; for they all are polluted and doing evil, and every mouth speaking folly. In all this his anger turned not back, and yet his hand stretched out.
{9:18} For wickedness burnt as fire; the sharp point and the thorn it shall consume, and shall burn in the thickets of the forest, and they shall roll up in the mounting up of smoke.
{9:19} In the outpourings of Jehovah of armies the land was consumed, and the people will be as the food of fire: and they shall not pity a man to his brother.
{9:20} And he shall cut upon the right hand, and hungering; and he shall eat upon the left, and they were not satisfied: they shall eat a man the flesh of his arm.
{9:21} Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: they being united against Judah. In all this his anger turned not back, and yet his hand stretched out.
{10:1} Wo to those decreeing not decrees, and they wrote writings of labor;
{10:2} To turn away the judgment of the powerless, and to strip off judgment of the distressed of my people, for widows to be their plunder, and they will plunder orphans.
{10:3} And what will ye do for the day of reviewing, and for the tempest coming from far off? upon whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?
{10:4} Not to bow under the bound, and they shall fell under the slain; in all this his anger turned not back, and yet his hand stretched out.
{10:5} Wo to Assur the rod of mine anger, and that rod in their hand, my wrath.
{10:6} Against a polluted nation will I send him, and upon a people of my outpouring will I command him to spoil a spoil and to plunder a plunder, and to set them a treading down as the clay of the streets.
{10:7} And he will not thus purpose, and his heart will not reckon thus; for in his heart to destroy and to cut off nations not few.
{10:8} For he will say, Are not my chiefs united together kings?
{10:9} Is not as Carchemish, Calno? if not as Arpad, Hamath? if not as Damascus, Shomeron?
{10:10} As my hand found for the kingdoms of nothing, and their carved images from Jerusalem and from Shomeron;
{10:11} Is it not according to what I did to Shomeron and to her nothings, thus will I do to Jerusalem and to her images?
{10:12} And it was when the Lord will complete all his work upon mount Zion and upon Jerusalem, I will review upon the fruit of the great heart of the king of Assur and upon the glory of his eyes lifted up.
{10:13} For he said, By strength of my hand I did, and by my wisdom, for I was discreet: and I will remove the bounds of the people, and their things prepared I plundered, and I will bring down as a strong one the inhabitants.
{10:14} And my hand will find as a nest for the strength of the peoples: and as he gathering eggs left, I gathered all the land; and there was not moving the wing, and opening wide the mouth, and peeping.
{10:15} Shall the axe vaunt itself against him hewing with it? shall the saw magnify itself against him moving it up and down? as the rod moving up and down with those lifting it up; as the lifting up of the rod not wood.
{10:16} For this shall Jehovah, the Lord of armies send among his fatnesses leanness; and under his glory he shall burn a burning as the burning of fire.
{10:17} And the light of Israel was for a fire, and his Holy for a flame: and he burnt and consumed his thorns, and his sharp points in one day:
{10:18} And the glory of his forest and his Carmel, from the soul and even to the flesh, he shall finish, and it was as he fainting pined away.
{10:19} And the remainder of the wood of his forest shall be of number, and a boy shall write them.
{10:20} And it was in that day the remainder of Israel shall no more add, and the escaping of the house of Jacob, to lean upon him smiting them; and were leaning upon Jehovah the holy of Israel in truth.
{10:21} The remainder shall turn back the remainder of Jacob to the mighty God.
{10:22} For if my people Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall turn back among them: a consumption decided overflowing justice.
{10:23} For the Lord Jehovah of armies made a completion, and decided it in the midst of all the land.
{10:24} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah of armies, Thou my people dwelling in Zion shalt not fear from Assur: with the rod he shall strike thee and he will lift up his rod upon thee, in the way of Egypt.
{10:25} For yet a very little and wrath finished, and mine anger, in their destruction.
{10:26} And Jehovah of armies roused up for him a scourge according to the blow of Midian at the rock Oreb: and his rod upon the sea, and he lifted it up in the way of Egypt.
{10:27} And it was in that day, his burden shall remove from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke was lightened from the face of the anointing.
{10:28} He came upon Aioth, he passed through into Migron; at Michmash he will deposit his vessels.
{10:29} They passed through the passage the hill a lodging to us; Ramesh trembled; the hill of Saul fled.
{10:30} Cry aloud with thy voice, thou daughter of Gallim: hearken to Irish, Anathoth answered.
{10:31} Madmenah moved; they dwelling in Gebim fled for safety.
{10:32} Yet the day to stand in Nob: his hand will shake the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
{10:33} Behold the Lord Jehovah of armies dividing the bough with sudden violence: and the high of stature hewn down, and the lofty shall be humbled.
{10:34} And he cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall with a lofty one.
{11:1} And a rod shall come forth from the stock of Jesse, and a sprout shall blossom from his roots:
{11:2} And the spirit of Jehovah resting upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah:
{11:3} His sweet odor in the fear of Jehovah: and not according to the seeing of his eyes shall he judge, and not according to the hearing of his ears shall he decide.
{11:4} And he judged the powerless with justice, and he decided in straightness for the humble of the earth: and he struck the earth with the rod of his mouth, and by the spirit of his lips he will slay the unjust.
{11:5} And justice was the girding of his loins, and truth the girding of his loins.
{11:6} The wolf dwelt with the lamb; and the panther will lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the falling together, and a little boy leading with them.
{11:7} And the heifer and the bear shall feed together, and their young shall lie down; and the lion shall eat straw as the ox.
{11:8} And the suckling was delighted upon the hole of the asp, and upon the viper's den the weaned directed his hand.
{11:9} They shall not do evil, and they shall not destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth full of the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters covering to the sea.
{11:10} And there was in that day a root of Jesse which stood for a signal of the peoples; to him shall the nations seek, and his rest was glory.
{11:11} And it was in that day Jehovah shall add the second time his hand to gain the remnant of his people which shall be left from Assur and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
{11:12} And he lifted up a signal to the nations, and he gathered the outcasts of Israel, and he will collect the dispersed of Judah from the four wings of the earth.
{11:13} And the jealousy of Ephraim was removed, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not press upon Ephraim.
{11:14} And they flew upon the shoulder of the rovers to the sea; together shall they plunder the sons of the east: Edom and Moab the sending forth of their hand, and the sons of Ammon their audience.
{11:15} And Jehovah exterminated the tongue of the sea of Egypt, and he moved to and fro his hand over the river with the strength of his wind, and he struck it to the seven torrents, and he caused them to tread in shoes.
{11:16} And there was a highway for the remnant of his people which shall be left from Assur, as it was to Israel in the day of his coming up from the land of Egypt.
{12:1} And thou saidst in that day, I will praise thee, O Jehovah: for thou wert angry with me, thine anger will turn back and thou wilt comfort me,
{12:2} Behold God my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid: for my strength and song is Jah Jehovah, and he will be to me for salvation.
{12:3} Ye drew water with gladness from the fountains of salvation.
{12:4} And ye said in that day, Praise ye to Jehovah, call upon his name; make known his deeds among the peoples; keep ye in remembrance that his name was exalted.
{12:5} Strike the chords to Jehovah, for he did a lifting up: this being known in all the earth.
{12:6} Cry out and shout for joy thou inhabitress of Zion, for great in the midst of thee the Holy One of Israel.
{13:1} The burden of Babel which Isaiah son of Amos saw.
{13:2} Lift ye up a signal upon the bare mountain, lift up the voice to them; move the hand to and fro and they shall come in to the entrances of the noble minded.
{13:3} I commanded to the consecrated, also I called the strong ones for mine anger, those exulting in my lifting up.
{13:4} The voice of a multitude in the mountain; the likeness of much people; the voice of the uproar of kingdoms, nations being gathered: Jehovah of armies reviewing the army of battle.
{13:5} Coming from a land from afar, from the extremity of the heavens, Jehovah and the vessels of his wrath to overthrow all the earth.
{13:6} Pipe ye, for the day of Jehovah draws near; as desolation shall it come from the Almighty.
{13:7} For this all hands shall be relaxed, and every heart of man shall melt.
{13:8} And they trembled; pains and writhings will lay hold of them; as she bringing forth they will be in pain: they shall wonder a man at his neighbor; their faces the face of flames.
{13:9} Behold, the day of Jehovah coming fierce and overflowing, and burning anger to set the earth for desolation: and he will destroy the sinner out of it.
{13:10} For the stars of the heavens and the giants of the sky shall not shine their light: the sun was darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
{13:11} And I appointed evil over the habitable globe, and upon the unjust their iniquity; and I caused to cease the pride of the arrogant, and I will humble the pride of the terrible.
{13:12} I will make a man precious above pure gold, and a man above the gold of Ophir.
{13:13} For this I will provoke the heavens to anger, and the earth shall tremble from her place, in the wrath of Jehovah of armies, and in the day of his burning anger.
{13:14} And it was as the roe being thrust down and as a sheep and not a man gathering: to his people shall they turn, and they shall flee a man to his land.
{13:15} All being found shall be thrust through; and every one scraped together shall fall by the sword.
{13:16} And their children shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes, and their houses shall be plundered, and their wives shall be ravished.
{13:17} Behold me rousing up the Modes against them, who shall not reckon silver; and gold they shall not delight in it.
{13:18} And the bows of the boys shall be dashed in pieces, and the fruit of the womb they shall not pity; and upon their sons their eye shall not have compassion.
{13:19} And Babel the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' grandeur was as God overthrowing Sodom and Gomorrah.
{13:20} It shall not be inhabited forever, and it shall not be dwelt in even to generation and generation: and the Arabian shall not go on there, and the shepherds shall not recline there.
{13:21} And inhabitants of the desert reclined there, and their houses were filled with howlings, and the daughters of the ostrich dwelt there, and he goats shall leap there.
{13:22} And howlers cried out in its palaces, and great serpents in the temples of delight: and her time draws near to come, and her days shall not be protracted.
{14:1} For Jehovah will pity Jacob, and he yet chose in Israel, and he gave them rest upon their land: and the stranger was joined to them, and they joined  themselves to the house of Jacob.
{14:2} And peoples took them and brought them to their place, and the house of Israel inherited them upon the land of Jehovah for servants and for maids: and they were captives to those having been made captives, and they came down upon those pressing them.
{14:3} And it was in that day Jehovah gave rest to thee from thy toil and from thy trouble, and from the hard service which was served upon thee.
{14:4} And thou tookest up this parable against the king of Babel, and thou saidst, How did he oppressing, cease! oppression ceased.
{14:5} Jehovah broke in pieces the rod of the unjust, the rod of the rulers.
{14:6} Striking the peoples in wrath a blow not removed, bringing down the nations in anger; pursuing, not sparing.
{14:7} All the earth rested, having quiet: they broke forth a rejoicing.
{14:8} Also the cypresses rejoiced at thee, the cedars of Lebanon: From that time thou wert laid down, he cutting off will not come up against us.
{14:9} Hades from beneath was moved for thee to meet thy coming: it roused the shades for thee, all the leaders of the earth: it raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
{14:10} All they will answer and say to thee, Also thou wert weak as we; thou wert made like to us.
{14:11} Thy grandeur was brought down to hades, the sound of thy harps: the worm was spread under thee, and worms covering thee.
{14:12} How thou fallest from the heavens, brilliant star, son of the morning! thou wert cut off to the earth, overthrowing upon the nations!
{14:13} And thou saidst in thy heart, I will go up to the heavens; from above to the stars of God I will lift up my throne, and I will sit upon the mountain of appointment in the thighs of the north.
{14:14} I will go up upon the heights of the cloud: I will become like the Most High.
{14:15} But to hades shalt thou come down, to the thighs of the pit.
{14:16} They seeing thee shall look upon thee, they shall attend to thee. This the man moving the earth, shaking kingdoms:
{14:17} Setting the habitable globe as a desert, and destroying its cities: for his bound opening not the house.
{14:18} All the kings of the nations, all of them, lay down in honor, a man in his house.
{14:19} And thou wert east out of thy grave as a sprout abhorred, a garment of the slain thrust through with the sword, and going down to the stones of the pit as a corpse trodden down.
{14:20} Thou shalt not be united with them in the grave, for thou destroyedst thy land, and didst slay thy people: the seed of those doing evil shall not be called forever.
{14:21} Prepare slaughter for his sons, for the iniquity of their fathers; they shall not rise and possess the land, and fill the face of the habitable globe with cities.
{14:22} And I rose against them, said Jehovah of armies, and I cut off to Babel the name and remainder, offspring and progeny, says Jehovah.
{14:23} And I set it for the possession of the hedge-hog, and pools of water: and I swept her with the broom of desolation, says Jehovah of armies.
{14:24} Jehovah of armies sware, saying, If not as I purposed thus it was, and as I counseled, this shall stand:
{14:25} To break Assur in my land, and upon my mountain I will tread him down: and his yoke was removed from off them, and his burden shall remove from off their shoulder.
{14:26} This the counsel being counseled upon all the land: and this the hand stretched out upon all the nations.
{14:27} For Jehovah of armies counseled and who shall bring to nought? and his hand was stretched out, and who shall turn it back?
{14:28} In the year king Ahaz died was this burden.
{14:29} Thou shalt not rejoice Philistia, all of thee, because the rod of him striking thee was broken: for from the root of the serpent shall come forth a viper, and his fruit burning flying.
{14:30} And the first born of the poor were fed, and the needy shall lie down confidently: and I killed thy root with famine, and thy residue he shall slay.
{14:31} Wail, thou gate; cry out, thou city; all thou Philistia, melting away, for from the north a smoke coming, and none being alone in his appointments.
{14:32} And what shall the messengers of the nations answer? for Jehovah founded Zion, and the humble of his people shall trust in her.
{15:1} The burden of Moab. For in the night the city of Moab was destroyed, perishing; for in the night the wall of Moab was destroyed, perishing.
{15:2} He went up to the house and to Dibon, the heights, to weep: over Nebo and Medeba shall Moab wail: upon all their heads baldness; every beard cut off.
{15:3} And in their places without they girded themselves with sackcloth: upon her roofs and in her streets every one shall wail, going down into weeping.
{15:4} And Heshbon shall cry and Elealah; even to Jahaz their voice was heard: for this the loins of Moab shall make a loud noise his soul shall be evil to him.
{15:5} My heart shall cry out for Moab; passing through even to Zoar, a heifer of three years: for going up to Luhith with weeping shall they go up into it: for the way of Horonaim they shall rouse up a cry of breaking.
{15:6} For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolation; for the grass dried up, the herbage failed; there was no green.
{15:7} For this the abundance made and their wealth upon the torrent of the Arabians shall they lift them up.
{15:8} For the cry surrounded the bound of Moab, its wailing even to Eglaim, and its wailing to the well of Elim.
{15:9} For the waters of Dimon were filled with blood: I will put additions upon Dimon, to the escaping of Moab, lions, and to the rest of the land.
{16:1} Send ye a lamb to the ruler to the land, from the rock of the desert to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.
{16:2} And it shall be as the bird fleeing, the nest cast out, the daughters of Moab shall be from the passages to Arnon.
{16:3} Bring ye counsel, do judgment; place as the night thy shadow in the midst of noon; hide the driven out; thou shalt not betray the fugitive.
{16:4} The outcast shall dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covering to them from the face of him laying waste: for the oppressor ceased, violence was finished, the treaders-down were consumed out of the land.
{16:5} And the throne was set up in mercy: and he sat upon it in truth in the tent of David, judging and seeking judgment, and hastening justice.
{16:6} We heard the pride of Moab; he was greatly elated; his haughtiness and his pride and his wrath; not so his empty talk.
{16:7} For this shall Moab wail for Moab, every one shall wail: for the foundations of the wall of Haresheth shall ye sigh; surely they were smitten.
{16:8} For the fields of Heshbon languished, the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the nations struck its vine of purple grapes, they reached even to Jazer, they wandered to the desert: her sprouts were thrust out, they passed over the sea.
{16:9} For this I will weep with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah; I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealah: for upon thy fruit harvest and upon thy harvest the vintage shout fell.
{16:10} And joy and gladness was taken away from Carmel, and in the vineyards there shall be no shout for joy, there shall be no cry with a loud voice: and he treading shall not tread out wine in the wine-vat: I caused the vintage shout to cease.
{16:11} For this my bowels shall sound as a harp for Moab, and my inner parts for the wall of Haresh.
{16:12} And it was when it was seen that Moab was weary upon the height, and coming to his holy place to pray and he shall not be able.
{16:13} This the word which Jehovah spake to Moab from that time.
{16:14} And now Jehovah spake, saying, In three years as the years of a hireling and the honor of Moab despised with with all the great multitude; and the remnant being small, not great.
{17:1} The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus being taken away from a city, and it was a falling heap of rubbish.
{17:2} The cities of Aroer were forsaken: they shall be for flocks, and they lay down, and none terrifying.
{17:3} And the fortress ceased from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Aram: they shall be as the glory of the sons of Israel, says Jehovah of armies.
{17:4} And it was in that day the glory of Jacob shall be feeble, and the fatness of his flesh shall waste away.
{17:5} And it was as he gathered the harvest of standing grain, and he shall reap the ears with his arm; and it was as he gathering ears in the valley of Rephaim.
{17:6} And he left in it gleaning, as the beating of the olive tree, two, three berries upon the head of the summit, four, five in the branches of its fruit, says Jehovah, God of Israel.
{17:7} In that day shall the man look upon him making him, and his eyes shall look to the Holy One of Israel.
{17:8} And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, and what his fingers made he shall not see, and the statues and the images.
{17:9} In that day shall his strong cities be as the forsaken thicket, and the summit which they forsook from the face of the sons of Israel: and it was a desolation.
{17:10} For thou didst forget the God of thy salvation, and didst not remember the rock of thy fortress, for this, thou shalt plant pleasant plants, and thou shalt sow it with vine shoots of the stranger.
{17:11} In the day of thy planting thou shalt hedge in, and in the morning thou shalt make thy seed fruitful: the harvest a heap in the day of thy possession and incurable pain.
{17:12} Wo to the multitude of many peoples; they will sound as the sound of the seas; and the tumult to the nations shall rage as the tumult of great waters.
{17:13} To the nations as the tumult of many waters they shall rage, and he rebuked him and he fled from far off and was pursued as the chief of the mountains before the wind and as stubble before the whirlwind.
{17:14} For the time of evening, behold, terror; before morning he is not This the portion of those plundering us, and the lot of those spoiling us.
{18:1} Wo to the land of the whizzing of wings, which is from beyond the rivers of Cush:
{18:2} Sending messengers upon the sea, and in vessels of the bulrush upon the face of the waters, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation drawn out and sharpened, to a people to be feared from this, and farther off; a nation of might, of might, and of treading down, of which the rivers divided up its land.
{18:3} All ye inhabiting the habitable globe, and dwelling in the earth, when lifting up a signal on the mountains, ye shall see; and when striking the trumpet, ye shall hear.
{18:4} For thus said Jehovah to me, I will cause rest, and I will behold in my dwelling place as the serene heat upon the light, and as a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
{18:5} For before the harvest, when the flower was completed, and the sour grape shall be ripening in the flower, and he cut off the shoots with pruning-hooks, and cutting off he took away the tendrils.
{18:6} They shall be left together to the ravenous bird of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the ravenous bird summered upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
{18:7} In that time shall a gift be brought to Jehovah of armies of a people drawn out, and sharpened, and from a people to be feared from this, and farther off; a nation of might, of might, and of treading down, of which the rivers divided up its lands, to the place of the name of Jehovah of armies, mount Zion.
{19:1} The burden of Egypt Behold, Jehovah riding upon a swift cloud and coming to Egypt: and the vanities of Egypt moved to and fro from his face, and the heart of Egypt will melt in its midst.
{19:2} And I aroused Egypt against Egypt, and they warred a man against his brother, and a man against his neighbor; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.
{19:3} And the spirit of Egypt was emptied in its midst, and its counsel I will destroy: and they sought to the vanities and to the mutterers, and to the necromancers, and to the wizards.
{19:4} And I shut up Egypt into the hand of hard lords, and a strong king shall rule over them, says the Lord Jehovah of armies.
{19:5} And the water failed from the sea, and the river will waste and dry up.
{19:6} They cast away the rivers; the rivers of Egypt languished and dried up; the reed and the sedge pined away.
{19:7} The naked places by the river upon the mouth of the river, and everything being sown by the river was dried up, driven away, and nothing of it.
{19:8} And the fishermen groaned, and all casting the hook into the river mourned, and they spreading nets upon the face of the water, languished.
{19:9} And they working hatcheled flax and they weaving white linens were ashamed.
{19:10} And her pillars were broken in pieces, and all making wages, sorrowful in soul.
{19:11} Also the chiefs of Zoan are foolish, the wise counseling Pharaoh the counsel became brutish: how shall ye say to Pharaoh, I the son of the wise, the son of kings of old?
{19:12} Where are they? where thy wise? and they shall announce to thee now, and they shall make known what Jehovah shall counsel upon Egypt.
{19:13} The chiefs of Zoan were foolish, the chiefs of Noph were deceived; and they caused Egypt to wander, the pinnacles of its tribes.
{19:14} Jehovah mingled in the midst of her a spirit of perversities) and they caused Egypt to wander in all its works as the intoxicated wanders in his vomit.
{19:15} And there shall not be to Egypt a work which shall make head and tail, branch and reed.
{19:16} In that day Egypt shall be as women; and it trembled and was afraid from the face of the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of armies which he shook over it.
{19:17} And the land of Judah was to Egypt for consternation, all which shall have it in remembrance shall be afraid to himself from the face of the counsel of Jehovah of armies which he shall counsel against it.
{19:18} In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt speaking the lip of Canaan, and they sware to Jehovah of armies; and to one it shall be said, The city of the sun.
{19:19} In that day there shall be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar near its bound to Jehovah.
{19:20} And it was for a sign and for a witness to Jehovah of armies in the land of Egypt, for they shall cry to Jehovah from the face of those pressing them, and he shall send to them him saving, and great, and he delivered them.
{19:21} And Jehovah shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day, and they made a sacrifice and gift, and they vowed a vow to Jehovah, and they completed.
{19:22} And Jehovah smote Egypt, and he smote and healed: and they turned back even to Jehovah, and he was entreated by them, and he healed them.
{19:23} In that day shall be a highway from Egypt to Assur, and Assur came into Egypt, and Egypt into Assur, and the Egyptians served with Assur.
{19:24} In that day Israel shall be the third to Egypt and to Assur, and a blessing in the midst of the land:
{19:25} Whom Jehovah of armies blest him, saying, Blessed my people of Egypt, and the work of my hand, Assur, and my inheritance Israel.
{20:1} In the year Tartan came to Ashdod, (in Sargon's sending him, king of Assur) and he will fight with Ashdod and take it:
{20:2} In that time spake Jehovah by the hand of Isaiah, son of Amos, saying, Go loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and thou shalt draw off the shoe from thy foot And he will do so, going naked and barefoot.
{20:3} And Jehovah will say, As my servant Isaiah went naked and barefoot three years, a sign and miracle upon Egypt and upon Cush:
{20:4} Thus shall the king of Assur lead the captivity of Egypt, and the exile of Cush, boys and old men naked and barefoot, and buttocks uncovered, the nakedness of Egypt.
{20:5} And they were dismayed and ashamed of Cush their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.
{20:6} And he inhabiting this island said in that day, Behold, thus our expectation, where we fled there for help to be delivered from the face of the king of Assur: and how shall we escape?
{21:1} The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south for passing through, from the desert it came, from a fearful land.
{21:2} A hard vision was announced to me: The spoiler spoiled, and he laying waste, laid waste. Go up, O Elam: press, O Media; all her sighing I caused to cease.
{21:3} For this, my loins were filled with pain: distress took hold of me as the pains of her bringing forth: I was shaken from hearing; I trembled from seeing.
{21:4} My heart wandered; trembling made me afraid: the evening twilight of my desire he put to me for fear.
{21:5} Set in order the table; view the watch-tower; eat, drink: arise ye chiefs, anoint the shield.
{21:6} For thus said Jehovah to me, Go set up a watchman, he shall announce what he shall see.
{21:7} He will see a chariot, a pair of horse men, the rider of an ass, the rider of a camel; and listening, he listened with much attention.
{21:8} And he will call, A lion: on the watch-tower my lord, I stand continually in the day, and upon my watch I stand all the night.
{21:9} And behold, here came a chariot, a man, a pair of horsemen. And he will answer and say, She fell, Babel fell; and the carved images of her god he brake in pieces to the earth.
{21:10} O my threshing, and the son of my threshing-floor, what I heard from Jehovah of armies the God of Israel, I announced to you.
{21:11} The burden of Dumah. He called to me from Seir, Watch, what of the night? watch, what of the night?
{21:12} The watch said, I will mark out morning, and also night; if ye will seek, seek ye: turn back, come.
{21:13} The burden of Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, ye wayfarers of Dedanim.
{21:14} To meet the thirsty, bring ye water, O inhabitants of the land of Tema: anticipate ye him wandering, with bread.
{21:15} For they fled from the face of the swords, the sword drawn out, and from the face of the bent bow, and from the face of the heaviness of war.
{21:16} For thus said the Lord to me, Within yet a year; as the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar was finished.
{21:17} And the rest of the bows of the strong sons of Kedar shall be few: for Jehovah God of Israel spake.
{22:1} The burden of the valley of vision. What to thee now, that thou wentest up all of thee, to the roofs?
{22:2} The city put in commotion was filled with noise, the exulting city: thy wounded not wounded of the sword, and not the dead of war.
{22:3} All thy chiefs fled together, they were bound of the bow: all they finding thee were bound together; they fled from from far off.
{22:4} For this I said, Look ye away from me; I will be bitter in my weeping, ye shall not hasten to comfort me upon the desolation of the daughter of my people.
{22:5} For a day of consternation, and of treading down, and perplexity by the Lord Jehovah of armies of the valley of vision, of undermining the wall, and of a cry for help to the mountains.
{22:6} And Elam lifted up the quiver with the chariot of men, horsemen; and Kir made naked the shield.
{22:7} And it shall be the chosen of thy valleys was filled with chariots, and the horsemen placed a seat at the gate.
{22:8} And he will uncover the covering of Judah, and thou wilt look in that day to the weapons of the house of the forest.
{22:9} The clefts of the city of David ye saw, that they were many: and ye shall gather the water of the lowest pool.
{22:10} The houses of Jerusalem ye numbered, and ye will break down the houses to fortify the wall.
{22:11} And ye made a gathering place between the two walls for the water of the old pool; and ye looked not to him making it, and ye saw not him forming it from far off.
{22:12} And the Lord Jehovah of armies in that day will call to weeping and to wailing, and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth:
{22:13} And behold, gladness and joy, killing cattle and slaughtering sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.
{22:14} And it was uncovered in the ears of Jehovah of armies, If this iniquity shall be expiated to you till ye shall die, said the Lord Jehovah of armies.
{22:15} Thus said the Lord Jehovah of armies, Go, come in to this associate to Shebna who is over the house,
{22:16} What to thee here, and who to thee here, that thou hewedst to thee here a tomb, he hewing from on high his tomb and cutting in a dwelling in a rock to himself?
{22:17} Behold, Jehovah casting thee down, the casting down of a man, and covering, he covered thee.
{22:18} Rolling, he will roll thee a roll as a ball into a land broad of hands: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory the dishonor of thy lord's house.
{22:19} And I thrust thee from thy station, and from thy standing place he will pull thee down.
{22:20} And it was in that day I called for my servant, for Eliakim, son of Hilkiah:
{22:21} And I will clothe him with thy tunic, and I will strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will give thy dominion into his hand, and he was for a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
{22:22} And I gave the key of the house of David upon his shoulder, and he opened and none shut, and he shut and none opened.
{22:23} And I fastened him a peg in a faithful place; and he was for a throne of glory to his father's house.
{22:24} And they hung upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the sprouts, all the vessels of smallness, from the vessels of lavers and even to all the vessels of flasks.
{22:25} In that day, says Jehovah of armies, shall the peg fastened in a faithful place give way, and it was cut down, and it fell; and the lifting up which was upon it was cut off: for Jehovah spake.
{23:1} The burden of Tyre. Wail, ye ships of Tarshish, for it was laid waste from a house from going in: from the land of Chittim it was uncovered to them.
{23:2} Be ye silent, O inhabitants of the isle; the merchants of Zidon passing over the sea filled thee.
{23:3} On many waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river her produce; and she shall be the emporium of nations.
{23:4} Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea said, the strength of the sea, saying, I was not pained, I brought not forth, and I caused not youths to grow, and I raised not up virgins.
{23:5} As the hearing to Egypt; they shall be pained as the hearing of Tyre.
{23:6} Pass ye through Tarshish; wail, ye inhabitants of the isle.
{23:7} This to you the exulting from the days of old, her beginning; her feet shall fail her sojourning from far off.
{23:8} Who will counsel this against Tyre, encircled with a crown, whom her merchants, chiefs; her merchants the honored of the earth.
{23:9} Jehovah of armies purposed it to profane the pride of all glory, to make light all the honored of the earth.
{23:10} Pass through thy land as a river, thou daughter of Tarshish: no more girding.
{23:11} He stretched forth his hand over the sea, he disquieted kingdoms: Jehovah commanded to Canaan to destroy her fortress.
{23:12} And he will say, Thou shalt no more add to exalt, thou violated virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; also there it shall not be rest to thee.
{23:13} Behold the land of the Chaldees; this people was not; Assur founded it for the inhabitants of the desert: they set up its watch-towers, they raised up its fortresses, he set it for ruins.
{23:14} Wail, ye ships of Tarshish: your strength was laid waste.
{23:15} And it was in that day, and Tyre was forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: from the end of seventy years it shall be to Tyre as the song of a harlot.
{23:16} Take a harp, go about the city, O harlot having been forgotten; be cheerful, playing on the instrument; increase the song so that thou shalt be remembered.
{23:17} And it was from the end of seventy years, Jehovah will review Tyre, and she turned back to her gift, and she committed fornication with all the kingdoms of the land upon the face of the earth.
{23:18} And her traffic and her gift holy to Jehovah: it shall not be treasured up, and it shall not be laid up; for to those dwelling before Jehovah her traffic shall be for eating to be satisfied, and for a splendid covering.
{24:1} Behold, Jehovah emptying the earth and making it waste, and subverting its face, and scattering its inhabitants.
{24:2} And it was as the people, so the priest; as the servant, so his lord; as the maid, so the mistress; as the buyer, so he selling; as he lending, so the borrower; as be lending on interest, so he exacting interest to him.
{24:3} Being emptied, the land shall be emptied: and being plundered, it shall be plundered: for Jehovah spake this word.
{24:4} The earth mourning, fell away: the habitable globe languishing, fell away: the heights of the people of the land languished,
{24:5} And the earth was polluted under its inhabitants, for they passed by the instructions, they changed the law, they broke the eternal covenant.
{24:6} For this, the curse consumed the earth, and they dwelling in it, will transgress: for this, they dwelling upon the earth were burned, and those remaining, men of fewness.
{24:7} The new wine mourned, the vine languished, all they joyful of heart, sighed.
{24:8} The exulting of the drums ceased, the noise of those triumphing, left off, the exulting of the harp ceased.
{24:9} They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to those drinking it.
{24:10} The city of desolation was broken down: every house was shut up from coining in.
{24:11} An outcry for wine in the streets; all joy grew dark, the exulting of the earth was carried into exile.
{24:12} Desolation was left in the city, and the gate shall be struck in ruins.
{24:13} For thus it shall be in the midst of the land in the midst of the peoples, as the beating of the olive, as the gleanings if the vintage was finished.
{24:14} They shall lift up their voice, they shall shout for joy in the majesty of Jehovah they cried aloud from the sea.
{24:15} For this, with lights they honored Jehovah in the isles of the sea, the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
{24:16} From the wing of the earth we heard songs, glory to the just one. And saying, Destruction to me, destruction to me, wo to me! they acting deceitfully, acted deceitfully; and spoiling, they acting deceitfully, acted deceitfully.
{24:17} Fear, and the pit, and the snare, upon thee, thou inhabiters of the earth.
{24:18} And it was he fleeing from the voice of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he coming up out of the midst of the pit, shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from the height were opened, and the foundations of the earth, will tremble.
{24:19} And being broken, the earth was broken to pieces, and the earth being abolished, it was abolished; the earth being shaken, shook.
{24:20} The earth moving to and fro, shall move to and fro as the intoxicated, and it was removed as a lodge; and its transgression was heavy upon it and it fell, and it shall not add to rise.
{24:21} And it was in that day Jehovah shall review upon the army of the height upon the height, and upon the kings of the earth upon the earth.
{24:22} And they gathered a collection of the bound into the dungeon, and they were shut up into a shutting up, and after many days they shall be reviewed.
{24:23} And the moon blushed, and the sun was ashamed, for Jehovah of armies reigned in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and was honored before his old men.
{25:1} O Jehovah, thou my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name, for thou didst a wonder; counsels from far off, stability, faithfulness.
{25:2} For thou didst set from a city to a heap, a fortified city to ruins: a palace of strangers from a city; it shall not be built forever.
{25:3} For this shall the strong people honor thee, the city of terrible nations shall fear thee.
{25:4} For thou wert a fortress to the poor, a fortress to the needy in straits; to him a refuge from the inundation, a shadow from the heat when the wind of the terrible ones as the inundation of the wall.
{25:5} As the heat in Zion the noise of strangers thou shalt bring down; the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the song of the terrible shall be humbled.
{25:6} Jehovah of armies will make to all peoples in this mountain a drinking of fatness, a drinking of lees of wine, fatness of marrows, strained lees of wine.
{25:7} And he will swallow up in this mountain the face of the covering covered over all peoples, and the veil covered over all nations.
{25:8} He swallowed up death for glory, the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people he will remove from off all the earth, for Jehovah spake.
{25:9} And it was said in that day, Behold, this our God, we hoped for him, and he will save us: this Jehovah, we hoped for him, we will rejoice and be glad in his salvation.
{25:10} For the hand of Jehovah shall rest in this mountain, and Moab was thrust down under him as straw was thrust down in the water of the dunghill.
{25:11} And he spread forth his hands in their midst, as he swimming will spread forth to swim: and he humbled their pride with the ambuscades of their hands.
{25:12} And the fortress of the height of thy walls shall be brought low; be humbled, be struck to the earth, even to the dust.
{26:1} In that day this song shall be sung in the land of Judah: A strong city to us; he will set salvation the wall and the fortification.
{26:2} Open ye the gates and the just nation watching truths shall come in.
{26:3} The mind placed upon thee thou wilt form peace, peace, because he trusted in thee.
{26:4} Trust ye in Jehovah even to eternity, for in Jah Jehovah is the rock of ages.
{26:5} For he bows down those dwelling in height; for the city set up on high he will bring it down; he will bring it down even to the earth; he will cause it to touch even to the dust.
{26:6} The foot shall tread it down, the feet of the humble, the steps of the poor.
{26:7} The way to the just one is straightness: being upright, thou wilt prepare the departing of the just one.
{26:8} Also the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah, we hoped for thee; to thy name and to thy remembrance is the desire of the soul.
{26:9} My soul desired thee in the night; also my spirit in the midst of me I will seek thee: for when thy judgments to the earth, those dwelling in the habitable globe will learn justice.
{26:10} Shall the unjust be shown favor? He learnt not justice; in the land of justice he will act perversely, and he will not see the majesty of Jehovah.
{26:11} O Jehovah, high thy hand, they will not see: they shall see and be ashamed for their jealousy of the people; also the fire of thine enemies shall consume them.
{26:12} O Jehovah, thou wilt judge peace for us: for also all our works thou didst for us.
{26:13} O Jehovah our God, lords besides thee had dominion over us; but in thee alone will we make mention of thy name.
{26:14} The dead shall not live; shades shall not rise; for this, thou reviewedst and thou wilt destroy them, and all remembrance to them shall perish.
{26:15} Thou didst add to the nation, O Jehovah, thou didst add to the nation thou wert honored: thou didst put far; away all the ends of the earth.
{26:16} O Jehovah, in straits they looked after thee; they poured out a whispering thy correction to them.
{26:17} As she conceiving will draw near to bring forth, she will be pained and cry out in her pangs, thus were we from before thee, O Jehovah.
{26:18} We conceived, we were pained, thus we brought forth wind; we shall not make the earth salvation, the inhabitants of the habitable globe shall not fall.
{26:19} Thy dead shall live, with my corpse shall they rise. Awake and shout, ye dwelling in dust: for the dew of brightness is thy dew, and the land of the shades shall fall.
{26:20} Go, my people, enter into thy apartments and shut thy doors about thee: hide thee as a little moment till the wrath shall pass by.
{26:21} For behold, Jehovah will come forth out of his place to review the iniquity of him dwelling in the earth upon him; and the earth uncovered her bloods, and she will no more cover over her slain.
{27:1} In that day Jehovah will review with his hard and great and strong sword upon leviathan the serpent fleeing, and upon leviathan the winding serpent; and he killed the dragon which was in the sea.
{27:2} In that day, A vineyard being red, sing to her.
{27:3} I Jehovah watched her; for the moments I will water her; lest he will review upon her, night and day I will watch her.
{27:4} Wrath not to me: who shall distribute to me the sharp point of the thorn in battle? I will rush upon her; I will set her on fire together.
{27:5} Or he shall lay hold upon my strength, he shall make peace to me, he shall make peace to me.
{27:6} Those coming of Jacob shall he cause to take root: Israel shall blossom and be fruitful, and they filled the face of the habitable globe with produce.
{27:7} According to the blow of him striking him, he struck him; or according to the killing of those killing him, he killed.
{27:8} In measure, in sending her forth thou wilt contend with her: he took away with a hard spirit in the day of the east,
{27:9} Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob shall be expiated; and this all the fruit to remove his sin; in his setting all the stones of the altar as stones of lime broken in pieces, the statues and images shall not stand up.
{27:10} For the fortified city was separated, the habitation being cast out and forsaken as the desert: there shall the calf feed, and there he shall lie down, and there he finished its branches.
{27:11} In its harvest being dried up, women shall break it off in coming, illuminating it: for it is a people not understanding: for this he making them will not compassionate them, and he forming them will not have mercy upon them.
{27:12} And it was in that day Jehovah will beat off from the stream of the river even to the torrent of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered together by one, one, ye sons of Israel.
{27:13} And it was in that day he shall strike upon the great trumpet, and they perishing came into the land of Assui, and the outcasts into the land of Egypt, and they worshiped to Jehovah in the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
{28:1} O to the crown of pride, wo to the hirelings of Ephraim! a flower falling away is the glory of his beauty which is upon the head of the valley of fatness of those smitten with wine.
{28:2} Behold, a strong and active one to Jehovah, as a storm of hail, a destroying tempest, as a storm of vast waters overflowing, let fall to the earth with the hand.
{28:3} With the feet shall the crown of pride, the hirelings of Ephraim, be trodden down.
{28:4} And the flower falling away was the glory of his beauty which is upon the head of the valley of fatness, as the first-fruits before fruit harvest which he looking at it shall see, in its continuing in his hand he will swallow it up.
{28:5} In that day shall Jehovah of armies be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, to the remnant of his people.
{28:6} And for a spirit of judgment to him sitting upon the judgment, and for strength of them turning back the battle of the storm.
{28:7} And these also went astray by wine, and by strong drink they erred; the priest and the prophet went astray by strong drink, they were swallowed up from wine, they erred from strong drink, they went astray in seeing, they wavered in judgment.
{28:8} For all tables were full of vomit, of filth without place.
{28:9} Whom shall he teach knowledge? whom shall he cause to understand hearing? those weaned from milk and those taken away from the breasts.
{28:10} For precept to precept, precept to precept; line to line, line to line; a little there, a little there:
{28:11} For with the stammerings of the lip and with another tongue he will speak to this people.
{28:12} To whom he said to them, This the rest they caused to the weary to rest; and this the quiet: and they would not hear.
{28:13} And the word of Jehovah was to them, precept to precept, precept to precept; line to line, line to line; a little there, a little there, so that they shall go and they stumbled backward, and were broken and snared and taken.
{28:14} For this, hear ye the word of Jehovah, ye men of scorn, ruling this people which is in Jerusalem.
{28:15} Because ye said, We cut out a covenant with death, and with hades we did this; when this overflowing scourge passed through it shall not come to us, for we set falsehood our refuge, and in a lie we hid ourselves.
{28:16} For this, thus said the Lord. Jehovah, Behold me placing for a foundation in Zion a stone, a stone of trial, a corner precious, a foundation being founded: and he believing shall not hasten.
{28:17} And I set judgment to the line and justice to the weight: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of falsehood, and the waters shall overflow the covering.
{28:18} And your covenant with death was obliterated, and your league with hades shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through and ye were for a treading down to it.
{28:19} When passing through it shall take you: for by morning by morning it shall pass through in the day and in the night: and it was only an agitation to;understand the hearing.
{28:20} For the spreading was shortened above stretching out, and the covering narrow for hiding one's self.
{28:21} For as mount Perazim shall Jehovah rise up, as the valley in Gibeon shall he be moved to do his work, his strange work, and to work his service, his unknown service.
{28:22} And now ye shall not be mocker's lest your bonds shall be strong: for I heard a completion and decision from the Lord. Jehovah of armies upon all the earth.
{28:23} Give ear and hear my voice; tend and hear my saying.
{28:24} Shall he ploughing, plough all the day to sow? shall he open and level his earth?
{28:25} Did he not make level its face and disperse the fennel flower, and he will scatter the cummin, and he set the wheat in order, and designated the barley, and the spilt in his bound?
{28:26} He will instruct him, according to judgment his God will teach him.
{28:27} For the fennel flower shall not be beaten with the threshing sledge, and the wheel of a wagon shall not be turned about upon the cummin; for the fennel flower shall be beaten out with the rod and the cummin with the rod.
{28:28} Bread shall be beaten small; for threshing, he will not forever thresh it; and the wheel of his wagon he put in motion and his horsemen shall not beat it small.
{28:29} Also this shall come forth from Jehovah of armies, he being wonderful of counsel and great of understanding.
{29:1} Wo to Ariel, Ariel, the city David encamped in! add ye year upon year; the festivals shall run their circle.
{29:2} And I pressed upon Ariel, and there was sorrow and sighing, and it was to me as Ariel.
{29:3} And I encamped as a circle upon thee, and I pressed upon thee with a garrison, and I raised intrenchments against thee.
{29:4} And thou being brought down, thou shalt speak from the earth, and thy word shall be depressed out of the dust, and thy voice as a necromancer from the earth, and thy saying Shall peep from the dust.
{29:5} And the multitude of thy strangers was as the thin dust, and Its the chaff passing away, the multitude of the terrible ones: and it was at a moment suddenly.
{29:6} From Jehovah of armies shalt thou be reviewed, with thunder and with shaking, and a great voice, whirlwind and storm, and the flames of consuming fire.
{29:7} And it was as a dream of a vision of the night, the multitude of all the nations warring against Ariel and all warring against her and her fastnesses, and those pressing upon her.
{29:8} And it was as when the hungry shall dream, and behold, he ate; and he awoke and his soul was empty: and as when the thirsty shall dream, and behold, he drank, and he awoke, and behold, he fainted, and his soul desired: thus shall be the multitude of all the nations warring against mount Zion.
{29:9} Linger ye, and wonder; delight yourselves, and be ye blinded; they were drunken and not with wine; they reeled and not with strong drink.
{29:10} For Jehovah poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and he will close your eyes: the prophets and your heads, the seeing he covered.
{29:11} And the vision of all will be to you as the words of the book being sealed, which they shall give to him, to him knowing writing, saying, Read now, this: and he said, I shall not be able, for it was sealed.
{29:12} And the book was given to him not knowing writing, saying, Read now, this: and he said, I know not writing.
{29:13} And Jehovah will say, Because that this people drew near with their month, and honored me with their lips, and their heart was far from me, and their fear towards me shall be taught from the command of men.
{29:14} For this, behold me adding to be wonderful with this people, dealing wonderfully and being a wonder: and the wisdom of their wise perished, and the understanding of their understanding ones shall be hid.
{29:15} Wo to those making deep to hide counsel from Jehovah, and their work was in darkness, and they will say, Who saw us? and who knew us?
{29:16} Shall not your perverting be reckoned as the potter's clay? for shall the work say to him making it, He made me not? and he being formed, say to him forming, He understood not?
{29:17} Is it not yet a very little and Lebanon turned back to Carmel, and Carmel shall be reckoned for a forest?
{29:18} In that day the deaf heard the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of thick darkness, and darkness.
{29:19} And the humble shall add joy in Jehovah, and the poor of men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
{29:20} For the terrible one ceased, the mocker was consumed, and they watching vanity were cut off:
{29:21} Leading a man into sin by a word, and laying snares for him doing justice in the gate, and they will turn aside the just one by vanity.
{29:22} For this, thus said Jehovah, to the house of Jacob, who redeemed Abraham, Jacob shall not now be ashamed and his face shall not now become pale.
{29:23} For in his seeing his children, the work of my hand, in his midst, they shall consecrate my name, and consecrate the Holy One of Jacob, and they shall fear the God of Israel.
{29:24} And they going astray shall know understanding, and they murmuring shall learn knowledge.
{30:1} Wo to sons turning aside, says Jehovah, to make counsel and not from me; and to cover a covering, and not my spirit so as to add sin upon sin:
{30:2} Going to come down to Egypt, and my mouth they asked not; to be strengthened by the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt.
{30:3} And the strength of Pharaoh was to you for shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt for reproach.
{30:4} For his chiefs were in Zoan, and his messengers will reach to Hanes.
{30:5} All acted wickedly for a people who will not profit them, not for help and not for profiting, but for shame and also for a reproach.
{30:6} The burden of quadrupeds of the south: into the land of straits and distress, the lioness and the lion from them, the viper and the burning flying they will lift up upon the shoulder of young asses, their riches, and upon the humps of camels their treasures, for a people who shall not profit.
{30:7} And the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose; therefore I called to this their violence ceased.
{30:8} Now go, write it to them upon a tablet, and engrave it upon a book, and it shall be for the latter day, forever even forever.
{30:9} For this is a people of contradiction, sons of lies, sons who will not to hear the law of Jehovah.
{30:10} Who said to the seeing, Ye shall not see, and to the perceiving, Ye shall not perceive for us right things, speak to us smooth things, perceive delusions.
{30:11} Remove from the way, turn aside from the path, cause to cease from before us the Holy One of Israel.
{30:12} Therefore thus said the Holy One of Israel, Because ye rejected in this word, and ye will trust in violence and perverseness, and ye will do upon it.
{30:13} For this, this iniquity shall be to you as a breach falling, gushing out in a high wall, of which the breaking will come suddenly at a moment.
{30:14} And he broke it as the breaking of a vessel of the potter's being crushed; he will not spare: and there shall not be found in its crushing a sherd to take fire from the burning, and to skim off water from the reservoir.
{30:15} For thus said Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, In turning back and in rest shall ye be saved; in quiet and in trust shall be your strength, and ye would not.
{30:16} And ye will say, No; for upon horses we will flee: for this ye shall flee: and upon the swift will we ride; for this they pursuing you shall be swift.
{30:17} One thousand from before the rebuke of one; from before the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye were left as a mast upon the head of the mountain, and as a signal upon the hill.
{30:18} And for this Jehovah will wait to compassionate you, and for this he will be lifted up to pity you, for Jehovah is a God of judgment: happy all they waiting for him.
{30:19} For the people shall dwell in Zion in Jerusalem: weeping, thou shalt not weep: pitying, he will pity thee at the voice of thy cry; for in his hearing, he answered thee.
{30:20} And Jehovah gave to you the bread of straits and the waters of oppression, and he will no more cover those teaching thee, and thine eyes shall be seeing those teaching thee:
{30:21} And thine ears shall hear the word from after thee, saying, This the way, go ye in it when ye shall turn to the right, and when ye shall turn to the left.
{30:22} And defile ye the thin covering of the carved images of thy silver, and the overlaying of the molten things of thy gold: thou shalt scatter them as a menstruous cloth, thou shalt say to it, Go forth.
{30:23} And he gave the rain of thy seed which thou shalt sow the earth and bread of the increase of the earth: and it was fat and fertile, thy cattle shall feed in that day in a large meadow.
{30:24} And the oxen and the young asses working the land shall eat salted provender which was winnowed with the fan and by the winnower.
{30:25} And there was upon every mountain being lofty and every hill lifted up, brooks and streams of water in the day of much slaughter, in the falling of the towers.
{30:26} And the light of the moon was as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun, shall be seven fold, as the light of seven days, in the day Jehovah bound up the breaking of his people, and he will heal the wound of his smiting.
{30:27} Behold, the name of Jehovah coming from far off, burning his wrath, and its lifting up heavy: his lips they were full of anger, and his tongue as consuming fire:
{30:28} And his spirit as the torrent overflowing, shall divide even to the neck, to shake the nations in the sieve of ruin: and a curb upon the cheeks of the people, causing to err.
{30:29} The song shall be to you as by night, consecrating a festival and gladness of heart, as he going with a pipe to come into the mountain of Jehovah to the rock of Israel.
{30:30} And Jehovah caused the swelling of his voice to be heard, and he will cause the letting down of his arm to be seen in the anger of his wrath, and the flame of a consuming fire, violent rain and tempest, and the stone of hail,
{30:31} For from the voice of Jehovah shall Assur be broken down, he will smite with a rod.
{30:32} And it was every one passing by the rod of foundation which Jehovah shall cause to rest upon him, with drums and with harps: and in battles of moving to and fro shall he war with with it.
{30:33} For tophet was set in order from yesterday; also it was prepared; for the king, he made deep, he made broad, its pile fire and much wood; the breath of Jehovah as a torrent of pitch burned upon it.
{31:1} Wo to those going down to Egypt for help; and they will look upon horses, and trust upon chariots, because they are many; and upon horsemen because they were strong greatly; and they looked not upon the Holy One of Israel, and sought not Jehovah.
{31:2} And he also being wise and he will bring evil, and he removed not his words: and he rose up against the house of those doing evil, and against the help of those working vanity.
{31:3} And the Egyptians, men and not God; and their horses, flesh and not spirit And Jehovah will stretch forth his hand, and he helping became weak, and he being helped, fell, and together shall they all be finished.
{31:4} For thus spake Jehovah to me, As the lion shall growl, and the young lion over his prey, when a fulness of shepherds shall be called against him, from their voice shall he not be terrified, and shall not he be humbled from their noise: thus shalt Jehovah of armies come down to war from mount Zion and for its hill.
{31:5} Its birds flying, so will Jehovah of armies cover over Jerusalem, covering and he delivered; and passing over he saved.
{31:6} Turn ye back to him against whom the sons of Israel made a deep turning away.
{31:7} For in that day they shall reject a man the vanities of his silver, and the vanities of his gold which your hands made for you to sin.
{31:8} And Assur fell by the sword, not of a man, and the sword not of a man, shall consume him, and he fled for himself from the face of the sword, and his young men shall be for tribute.
{31:9} And his rock shall pass through from fear, and his chiefs were terrified from the signal, says Jehovah whose light to him in Zion, and furnace to him in Jerusalem.
{32:1} Behold, a king shall reign for justice, and for chiefs they shall rule for judgment.
{32:2} And a man was as a hiding of the spirit, and a covering of the tempest; as brooks of water in Zion, as the shadow of a weighty rock in a weary land.
{32:3} And the eyes of those seeing shall not be blinded, and the ears of those hearing shall attend.
{32:4} And the heart of the hasty shall understand to know, and the tongue of those stammering shall hasten to speak plain.
{32:5} Liberal shall no more be called to the foolish, and noble shall not be said to the deceiver.
{32:6} For the foolish will speak folly, and his heart will do vanity to do profaneness and to speak error to Jehovah, to empty the soul of the hungry; and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
{32:7} And the implements of the deceiver are evil: he will meditate counsels to destroy the humble with words of falsehood, and in the needy's speaking judgments.
{32:8} And the liberal will counsel liberal things, and upon liberal things shall he stand.
{32:9} Rise up, ye careless women; hear my voice, ye confident daughters; give ear to my word.
{32:10} Days over a year shall ye being confident, be disturbed; for the vintage being finished, the ingathering shall not come.
{32:11} Tremble, ye careless be disturbed, ye, confident: strip and be naked, gird upon the loins.
{32:12} Smiting upon the breasts for the fields of desire, for the fruitful vine.
{32:13} Upon the land of my people shall come up the thorn of the sharp point; so upon the houses of rejoicing of the exulting city.
{32:14} For the fortress was left, the multitude of the city was forsaken; the hill and the watch-tower for caves even forever; the rejoicing of the wild asses a pasture of the flocks;
{32:15} Until the spirit shall be poured upon us from on high, and the desert be for Carmel, and Carmel be reckoned for a forest.
{32:16} And judgment dwelling in the desert, and justice shall sit in Carmel.
{32:17} And the work of justice was peace, and the service of justice, rest and confidence, even to forever.
{32:18} And my people shall sit in a dwelling of peace, and in habitations of trust and in quiet resting places.
{32:19} And the hail hailing upon the forest; and the city shall be made low in lowness.
{32:20} Happy ye sowing upon all waters, sending the foot of the ox and the ass.
{33:1} Wo to thee oppressing, and thou not oppressed; and spoiling, and they spoiled not upon thee! when thou finishing to oppress, thou shalt be oppressed; when thou ceasing to spoil, they shall spoil upon thee.
{33:2} O Jehovah, pity us: we hoped for thee: be thou their arm for the mornings, also our salvation in time of straits.
{33:3} From the voice of the multitude peoples fled; from thy lifting up, nations were scattered.
{33:4} And your spoil was gathered the gathering of the locust: as the running about of locusts he ran to and fro upon it.
{33:5} Jehovah was exalted; for he dwells On high: he filled Zion with judgment and justice.
{33:6} And the stability of thy times, the strength of salvation, was wisdom and knowledge: the fear of Jehovah this his treasure.
{33:7} Behold the lions of God they cried out without: the messengers of peace shall weep bitterness.
{33:8} The highways lay waste, the traveler passing by, ceased: he brake the covenant, he despised the cities, he reckoned them not men.
{33:9} The earth mourning, languished: Lebanon being ashamed, pined away: Sharon was as a sterile region, and Bashan was shaken, and Carmel.
{33:10} Now will I rise, Jehovah will say; now will I be exalted; now will I be lifted up.
{33:11} Ye shall conceive dry grass, ye shall bring forth straw: your spirit of fire shall consume you.
{33:12} And peoples were the burnings of lime; thorns cut down, in fire shall they be burnt.
{33:13} Hear, ye afar off, what I did and know, ye drawing near, my strength.
{33:14} The sinners in Zion trembled; trembling seized the profane. Who to us shall sojourn with devouring fire? who to us with everlasting burning?
{33:15} He going in justice and speaking uprightness, rejecting in the plunder of oppression; shaking his hands from holding upon a gift, shutting his ear from the hearing of bloods, and binding up his eyes from looking upon evil;
{33:16} He shall dwell upon heights: the strongholds of rocks his height: his bread was given; his waters sure.
{33:17} Thine eyes shall perceive the king in his beauty: they shall see the land from far off.
{33:18} Thy heart shall meditate terror. Where the scribe? where the weigher? where he writing the towers?
{33:19} Thou shalt not see a firm people, a people of a deep lip above hearing; of a stammering tongue, of no understanding.
{33:20} Behold Zion the city of our appointment: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet dwelling, the tent shall not remove; its pegs shall not be pulled up forever, and none of its cords shall be broken.
{33:21} But there the mighty Jehovah to us a place of rivers, rivers broad of hands; a ship with the oar shall not go in it, and a mighty ship shall not pass over it.
{33:22} For Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah our law-giver, Jehovah our king; he will save us.
{33:23} Thy cords were broken in pieces; they will not well strengthen their mast; they spread not the flag: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame plundered the plunder.
{33:24} And the inhabitant shall not say, I was sick: to the people dwelling in it, iniquity was lifted up.
{34:1} Draw near, ye nations, to hear; and ye people, attend: the earth shall hear, and its fulness; the habitable globe, and all its offspring.
{34:2} For the wrath of Jehovah is upon all nations, And anger upon all their army: he devoted them to destruction, he gave them to slaughter.
{34:3} And their wounded shall be cast out, and their carcasses the stench shall go up, and the mountains flowed down from their blood.
{34:4} And all the army of the heavens melted, and the heavens shall roll together as a book, and all their army shall fall away as the leaf falling from the vine, and as a falling from the fig tree.
{34:5} For my sword was drunk in the heavens: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of destruction for judgment.
{34:6} The sword of Jehovah was filled with blood, it was made fat from the fat of the blood of lambs and he goats, from the fat of kidneys of rams: for a sacrifice to Jehovah in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
{34:7} And the buffaloes shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the strong ones; and their land was drunk from blood, and from fat shall their dust be made fat.
{34:8} For a day of vengeance to Jehovah, a year of retributions for the contention of Zion.
{34:9} And its torrents turned to pitch, and its dust to sulphur, and its land to burning pitch.
{34:10} Night and day it shall not be quenched; its smoke shall go up forever: from generation to generation it shall be laid waste; none passing through it forever to forever.
{34:11} And the pelican and the hedgehog shall possess it; the ibis and the raven shall dwell in it: and he stretched out upon it the line of desolation and the stones of emptiness.
{34:12} Its nobles shall be called to the kingdom, and none there, and all its chiefs shall be no more.
{34:13} And thorns came up in her palaces, the nettle and the thorn bush in her fortifications, and it was a dwelling of jackals, an enclosure for the daughters of the ostrich.
{34:14} And animals of the desert lighted upon the howlers, and the he goat shall call to his neighbor; also there the night spectre rested, and found for herself a resting place.
{34:15} There the arrow-snake nested, and she will lay eggs and hatch, and brood in her shadow: also there the falcons were collected, the female with her companion.
{34:16} Seek ye from the book of Jehovah, and read: One of these was not wanting; a female her companion they missed not: for my mouth it commanded, and his spirit it collected them.
{34:17} And be cast the lot for them, and his hand divided it to them by line; they shall possess it even forever, to generation and generation they shall dwell in it.
{35:1} The desert and the dryness shall be glad for them; and the sterile region shall rejoice and blossom as the meadow flower.
{35:2} Blossoming, it shall blossom and rejoice, also with joy and shouting: the glory of Lebanon was given to it, the majesty of Carmel and Sharon they shall see the glory of Jehovah, the majesty of our God.
{35:3} Strengthen the relaxed hands and make firm the feeble knees.
{35:4} Say to those hasty of heart, Be strong ye shall not fear; behold, your God will come with vengeance, the recompense of God; he will come and save you.
{35:5} Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be opened.
{35:6} Then shall the lame one leap as the stag, and the tongue of the dumb shall give forth the voice: for waters brake forth in the desert, and torrents in the sterile region.
{35:7} And the dry was for a pool, and the thirsty land for fountains of water: in the dwelling of jackals its lying down, an enclosure for the reed and the bulrush
{35:8} And a highway was there, and a way, and it shall be called to it, A way of holiness; the unclean one shall not pass through it; and it is for them; he going the way, and the foolish shall not err.
{35:9} The lion shall not be there, and the rapacious beast shall not go up upon it, it shall not be found there; and the redeemed went.
{35:10} And the ransomed of Jehovah shall turn back and come to Zion with a shout of joy and eternal joy upon their heads: and they shall attain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
{36:1} And it will be in the fourteenth year to king Hezekiah, Senherib kind of Assur came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and he will seize them.
{36:2} And the king of Assur will send Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a weighty army. And he will stand by the channel of the higher pool in the highway of the fuller's field.
{36:3} And Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, will come forth, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah Asaph's son, remembering.
{36:4} And Rabshakeh will say to them, Say now to Hezekiah, Thus said the king, the great king of Assur, What this trust in which thou trustedst?
{36:5} I said, (also a word of the lips) Counsel and strength for the war; now upon whom trustedst thou that thou didst rebel against me?
{36:6} Behold, thou trustedst upon the staff of this broken reed, upon Egypt; which, shall a man rest upon it, it was into his hand and pierced it: thus Pharaoh king of Egypt to all trusting upon him.
{36:7} And if thou shalt say to me, We trusted to Jehovah our God: is it not he whom Hezekiah turned away his heights, and his altars, and he will say to Judah and to Jerusalem, Before this altar shall ye worship?
{36:8} And now, become surety now, to my lord the king of Assur, and I will give to thee two thousand horses if thou shalt be able to give to thee riders upon them.
{36:9} And how wilt thou turn back the face of one prefect of the servants of my lord, the smallest of them, aid trust for thee upon Egypt for chariot and for horsemen?
{36:10} And now came I up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.
{36:11} And Eliakim will say, and Shebna, and Joah, to Rabshakeh, Speak now to thy servants Aramean, for we hear; and thou shalt not speak to us Judaic in the ears of the people who are upon the wall.
{36:12} And Rabshakeh will say, Did my lord send me to thy lord and to thee to speak these words? did he not to the men sitting upon the wall to eat their excrements and to drink their urine with you?
{36:13} And Rabshakeh will stand and call with a great voice in Judaic, and say, Hear ye the words of the king, the great king of Assur.
{36:14} Thus said the king, Hezekiah shall not lift up to you, for he will not be able to deliver you.
{36:15} And Hezekiah shall not cause you to trust to Jehovah, saying, Delivering, Jehovah will deliver us: this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assur.
{36:16} Ye shall not hear to Hezekiah; for thus said the king of Assur, Make to me a blessing, and come forth to me: and eat a man of his vine and a man of his fig tree, and drink ye a man water of his cistern;
{36:17} Till my coming and I took you to a land as your land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
{36:18} Lest Hezekiah shall stimulate you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Did each of the gods of the nations deliver his land from the hand of the king of Assur?
{36:19} Where the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where the gods of Sepharvaim? and when have they delivered Shomeron from my hand?
{36:20} Who among all the gods of these lands who delivered their land from my hand, that Jehovah will deliver Jerusalem from my hand?
{36:21} And they will be silent and not answer him a word: for this the command of the king, saying, Ye shall not answer.
{36:22} And Eliakim son of Hilkiah who was over the house, will go in, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, remembering, to Hezekiah, their garments rent, and they will announce to him the words of Rabshakeh.
{37:1} And it will be when king Hezekiah heard, and he will rend his garments, and he will be covered with sackcloth and go in to the house of Jehovah.
{37:2} And he will send Eliakim who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the old men of the priests covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah, son of Amos, the prophet.
{37:3} And they will say to him, Thus said Hezekiah, A day of straits and chastisement and reproach, this day; for the sons came even to the breaking forth and not strength to bring forth.
{37:4} Perhaps Jehovah thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh whom his lord the king of Assur sent him to reproach the living God, and judge upon the words which Jehovah thy God heard; and lift thou up a prayer for the remnant being found.
{37:5} And the servants of king Hezekiah will come to Isaiah.
{37:6} And Isaiah will say to them, Thus shall ye say to your lord, Thus said Jehovah, Thou shalt not fear from the face of the words which thou heardest which the boys of the king of Assur reviled me.
{37:7} Behold me giving a spirit into him and he heard a report, and he turned back to his land; and I caused him to fall by the sword in his land.
{37:8} And Rabshakeh will turn back and find the king of Assur warring against Libnah: for he heard that he removed from Lachish.
{37:9} And he heard concerning Tirhakah, king of Cush, saying, He came forth to war with thee. And he will hear, and send messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
{37:10} Thus shall ye say to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Thy God in whom thou trustest shall not lift thee up in him, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assur.
{37:11} Behold, thou heardest what the kings of Assur did to all the lands to destroy them; and shalt thou be delivered?
{37:12} Did the gods of the nations deliver them which my fathers destroyed, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden which were in Thelassar?
{37:13} Where the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king to the city of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivah?
{37:14} And Hezekiah will take the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it: and he will go up to the house of Jehovah, and Hezekiah will spread it before Jehovah.
{37:15} And Hezekiah will pray to Jehovah, saying,
{37:16} Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, dwelling in the cherubim, thou thyself God alone to all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made the heavens and the earth.
{37:17} Bend, O Jehovah, thine ear, and hear; open, O Jehovah, thine eye, and see; and hear all the words of Senherib which he sent to reproach the living God.
{37:18} Indeed, O Jehovah, the kings of Assur laid waste all the lands, and their land;
{37:19} And he gave their gods into fire; for they were not God but the work of man's hands, wood and stone: and they will destroy them.
{37:20} And now, Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, and all the kingdoms of the earth shall know that thou alone art Jehovah.
{37:21} And Isaiah son of Amos will send to Hezekiah, saying, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Because thou didst pray to me against Senherib the king of Assur.
{37:22} This the word that Jehovah spake concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion despising to thee, deriding to thee; the daughter of Jerusalem shook her head after thee.
{37:23} Whom didst thou reproach and revile, and against whom didst thou raise up the voice, and wilt thou lift up thine eyes on high to the Holy One of Israel?
{37:24} By the hand of thy servants thou didst reproach Jehovah, and wilt thou say, By the multitude of my chariots I came up to the height of the mountains, to the thighs of Lebanon; and I will cut down the stature of his cedars, the choicest of his cypresses: and I will go into the height of his extremity, the forest of his Carmel.
{37:25} I dug and drank water; and I will dry up with the sole of my footstep all the rivers of Egypt,
{37:26} Didst thou not hear to remoteness I did it? from days of old and I formed it? now did I bring it and thou shalt be to lay waste fortified cities into straits.
{37:27} And their inhabitants short of hand; they were dismayed and ashamed; they were the greet herb of the field and the verdure, and the tender grass of the enclosure of the roofs, and a blasting before it rose up.
{37:28} And thy dwelling, and thy going out, and thy coming in, I knew; and thine anger against me.
{37:29} Because thine anger against me and thine arrogance came up into mine ear, and I put my hook in thy nose and my curb in thy lips, and I turned thee back in the way which thou camest in it.
{37:30} And this the sign to thee: To eat this year the self-sown; and in the second year, that growing of itself: and in the third year, sow and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruits.
{37:31} And the escaping of the house of Judah being left shall add a root downward and make fruit upward:
{37:32} For from Jerusalem shall come forth a remnant, and the escaping from mount Zion: the zeal of Jehovah of armies shall do this.
{37:33} For this, thus said Jehovah concerning the king of Assur, Thou shalt not come into this city, and thou shalt not shoot an arrow there, and thou shalt not go before it with a shield, and thou shalt not cast a mound against it.
{37:34} In the way which he came in it he shall turn back, and to this city he shall not come in, says Jehovah.
{37:35} And I covered over this city to Save it for my sake, and for the sake of David my servant.
{37:36} And the messenger of Jehovah will go forth, and strike in the camp of Assur a hundred and eighty-five thousand: and they will rise early in the morning, and behold, all of them dead corpses.
{37:37} And Senherib king of Assur will remove and go and turn back and dwell in Nineveh.
{37:38} And it will be he worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, and Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, struck him with the sword; and they escaped to the land of Ararat; and Esar-Haddon his son will reign in his stead.
{38:1} In those days Hezekiah was sick to death. And Isaiah son of Amos, the prophet, will come in to him, and say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Command to thy house, for thou diest, and shalt not live.
{38:2} And Hezekiah will turn his face to the wall and pray to Jehovah.
{38:3} And he will say, O Jehovah, remember now how I went before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and I did the good in thine eyes: And Hezekiah will weep a great weeping.
{38:4} And the word of Jehovah will be to Isaiah, saying,
{38:5} Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus said Jehovah, the God of David thy father, I heard thy prayer; and I saw thy tears: behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years.
{38:6} And I will deliver thee and this city from the hand of the king of Assur: and I covered over this city.
{38:7} And this to thee the sign from Jehovah that Jehovah will do this word which he spake:
{38:8} Behold me turning back the shadow of the steps which will go down in the steps of Ahaz in the sun, backward ten steps. And the sun will turn back ten steps in the steps which it will go down.
{38:9} The writing to Hezekiah king of Judah in his being sick, and he will live from his sickness:
{38:10} I said in the quiet of my days, I shall go to the gates of hades: I was missed the remainder of my years.
{38:11} I said, I shall not see Jah Jah, in the land of the living: I shall no more behold man with the inhabitants of the place of rest.
{38:12} Mine age removed, and was carried away from me as a shepherd's tent: I rolled together as a weaver my life: from the thread he will cut me off: from the day even to the night thou wilt finish me.
{38:13} I set till the morning, as the lion thus will he break all my bones: from the day even to the night thou wilt finish me.
{38:14} As the twittering swallow so shall I chirp: I shall murmur as the dove: mine eyes languished for height: O Jehovah, oppression is to me; be surety for me.
{38:15} What shall I speak? and he said to me, and he did: I shall go slowly all my years upon the bitterness of my soul.
{38:16} O Jehovah, upon these they shall live, and for all of these the life of my spirit: and thou wilt heal me and cause me to live.
{38:17} Behold, for peace bitterness, to me bitterness: and thou didst cleave to my soul from the pit of destruction: and thou didst cast all my sin behind my back.
{38:18} For not hades shall praise thee, death celebrate: they going down to the pit shall not hope for thy truth.
{38:19} The living; the living, he shall praise thee, as from me this day the father to the sons shall make known for thy truth.
{38:20} Jehovah to save me; and striking my stringed instruments all the days of our life for the house of Jehovah.
{38:21} And Isaiah will say, They shall lift up round cakes of figs, and rub over the burning sore, and he shall live.
{38:22} And Hezekiah will say, What the sign that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah?
{39:1} In that time Merodach-Baladan, son of Baladan king of Babel, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah: and he will hear that he was sick, and he will be strengthened.
{39:2} And Hezekiah rejoiced over them, and he will cause them to see the house of the spices, the silver and the gold and the aromatics, and the good oil, and all the house of his vessels: and all which was found in his treasures, there was not a word which Hezekiah caused them not to see, in his house and in all his dominions.
{39:3} And Isaiah the prophet will come to king Hezekiah, and say to him, What said these men? and from whence will they come to thee? And Hezekiah will say, From a land far off came they to me, from Babel.
{39:4} And he will say, What saw they in thy house? and Hezekiah will say, All which is in my house they saw: there was not a word that I caused them not to see in my treasures.
{39:5} And Isaiah will say to Hezekiah, Hear thou the word of Jehovah of armies:
{39:6} Behold, the days coming and all which is in thy house and which thy fathers treasured up, even to this day, being lifted up to Babel: there shall not be left a word, said Jehovah.
{39:7} And from thy sons that shall come forth from thee which thou shalt beget, they shall take; and they were eunuchs in the temple of the king of Babel.
{39:8} And Hezekiah will say to Isaiah, Good the word of Jehovah which thou spakest And he will say, That there shall be peace and truth in my days.
{40:1} Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, will your God say.
{40:2} Speak ye to the heart of Jerusalem, and call to her that her war was filled up, her iniquity was paid off: that she received from the hand of Jehovah double for all her sins.
{40:3} The voice of him calling in the desert, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah, make straight in the sterile region a highway for our God.
{40:4} Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the acclivity was for evenness, and the mountain ranges for a valley:
{40:5} And the glory of Jehovah was uncovered, and all flesh saw it together: for the mouth of Jehovah spake.
{40:6} The voice said, Call And he said, What shall I call? All flesh grass, and all its goodness as the flower of the field:
{40:7} The grass was dried up, the flower fell away: for the spirit of Jehovah blew upon it: surely the people grass.
{40:8} The grass was dried up, the flower fell away: and the word of our God shall stand forever.
{40:9} Upon the high mountain come up for thee, O Zion: announcing the good news, lift up thy voice with strength, O Jerusalem; announcing the good news, lift up, thou shalt not be afraid; say to the cities, Behold your God!
{40:10} Behold the Lord Jehovah will come in strength, and his arm ruling for him: behold, his reward with him and his work before him.
{40:11} As a shepherd he will feed his flock: with his arm he will gather the lambs, and will lift up into his bosom, he will lead those coming up.
{40:12} Who measured the water in his palm, and measured the heavens with a span, and held the dust of the earth in a third, and weighed the mountains in a balance and the bills in scales?
{40:13} Who measured the spirit of Jehovah? and will a man of his counsel make him to know?
{40:14} With whom did he consult, and will he cause him to understand and teach him in the path of judgment, and teach him knowledge, and cause him to know the way of understanding?
{40:15} Behold, the nations as a drop from a bucket; they were reckoned as the fine dust of the scales: behold, he will cast down the isles as small dust.
{40:16} And Lebanon not enough to burn, and its beasts not enough for a burnt-offering.
{40:17} All the nations as nothing before him; they were reckoned to him from nothing, and vanity.
{40:18} And to whom will ye liken God? what likeness will ye compare to him?
{40:19} The artificer cast the carved image, and the founder will spread it out with gold, and he smelted chains of silver.
{40:20} And he being poor of oblation will choose wood that will not be rotten; he will seek to him a wise artificer to prepare a carved image that will not shake.
{40:21} Will ye not know? will ye not hear? was it not announced to you from the beginning? did ye not understand from the foundations of the earth?
{40:22} He sitting upon the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants as locusts; he stretching out the heavens as fine cloth, and he will extend them as a tent to dwell in:
{40:23} He gave princes to nothing; he made the judges of the earth as vanity.
{40:24} Also they were not planted: also they were not sown: also their stock took not root in the earth: and he also blew upon them and they will be dried up, and the storm will lift them up as straw.
{40:25} And to whom will ye liken me, and shall I be equal? will say the Holy One.
{40:26} Lift up your eyes on high, and see who created these, bringing forth their army by number: he will call to all of them by name, from the multitude of their strength; and he is strong of power; a man was not wanting.
{40:27} For what wilt thou say, O Jacob, and wilt thou speak, O Israel, My way was hid from Jehovah, and my judgment will pass over from my God.
{40:28} Didst thou not know? heardest thou not the eternal God, Jehovah, creating the extremities of the earth, will not faint, and will not be weary? no searching to his understanding.
{40:29} He gave power to the faint; and to the not strong he will increase strength.
{40:30} And the boys shall be faint and weary, and the young men faltering, shall become feeble.
{40:31} And they waiting for Jehovah shall change power; they shall go up on the wing as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall go and not faint.
{41:1} Be silent to me, ye islands; and the people shall change strength: they shall draw near; then shall they speak: together we will come near for judgment.
{41:2} Who raised up justice from the sunrising? he shall call him to his foot; he will give the nations before him; and he will bring down kings: he will give as the dust of his sword, as driven straw, his bow.
{41:3} He will pursue them, he will pass over in peace; the path he will not come in with his feet.
{41:4} Who made and did, calling the generations from the beginning? I Jehovah, the first, and with the last; I am he.
{41:5} The isles saw, and they will be afraid; the extremities of the earth will tremble; they drew near and they will come.
{41:6} They will help a man his neighbor, and he will say to his brother, Be strong.
{41:7} And the artificer will strengthen the founder, he making smooth with the hammer, he beating the anvil, saying, It is good for the welding; he will strengthen it with nails; it shall not totter.
{41:8} And thou, Israel, my servant Jacob whom I chose thee, the seed of Abraham my beloved:
{41:9} Whom I held thee fast from the extremities of the earth, and I called thee from its sides, and saying to thee, Thou my servant; I chose thee, and I rejected thee not.
{41:10} Thou shalt not fear, for I am with thee: thou shalt not look around for help for I thy God will strengthen thee; also I helped thee; also I held thee up with the right hand of my justice.
{41:11} Behold, all they burning with anger against thee shall be ashamed and disgraced: they shall be as nothing; and the men of thy strife shall be destroyed.
{41:12} Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them; the man of thy contention, the men of thy war, shall be as nothing and as no more.
{41:13} For I Jehovah thy God holding thy right hand, saying to thee, Thou shalt not fear; I helped thee.
{41:14} Thou shalt not fear, thou worm Jacob, ye men of Israel; I helped thee, says Jehovah, and thy redeemer the Holy One of Israel.
{41:15} Behold, I set thee to a new cutting threshing sledge having mouths: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat small, and the hills thou shalt set as chaff.
{41:16} Thou shalt winnow them, and the wind shall lift them up, and the storm shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in Jehovah, and glory in the Holy One of Israel.
{41:17} The poor and the needy seeking water, and none; their tongue failing in thirst, I Jehovah will answer them; the God of Israel, I will not forsake them.
{41:18} I will open rivers upon naked hills, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will set the desert for a pool of water, and the dry land for goings forth of water.
{41:19} I will give in the desert the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the tree of oil; I will set in the sterile region the the elm and the box tree together.
{41:20} So that they shall see and know and attend, and consider together that the hand of Jehovah did this, and the Holy One of Israel created it.
{41:21} Bring near your cause, Will say Jehovah; draw near your strong defences, will the king of Jacob say:
{41:22} They shall draw near and announce to us what shall happen: shewed they the former things, what they were, and we will set our heart, and we shall know their latter state; or did we hear things coming?
{41:23} Announce the things coming hereafter, and we shall know that ye are God: also will ye do good or will ye do evil, and we shall look around for help and see together.
{41:24} Behold, ye are from nothing, and your work no more: an abomination he will choose in you.
{41:25} I roused up from the north, and he will come: from the rising of the sun he shall call upon my name: and he shall come upon prefects as clay, and as the potter will tread down the mud.
{41:26} Who announced from the beginning, and we shall know? and before, and we shall say, He is just; also none announcing; also none hearing; also none heard your words.
{41:27} The first to Zion, Behold, behold them: and to Jerusalem I will give him announcing good news.
{41:28} And I shall see, and no man; and from these, and no counselor; and I shall ask them, and they will not turn back a word.
{41:29} Behold, all of them, nothing; their works are no more: wind and emptiness are their libations.
{42:1} Behold my servant, I will hold fast in him; my chosen, my soul delighted; I gave my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the nations.
{42:2} He shall not cry, and be shall not lift up, and he shall not cause his voice to be heard without.
{42:3} A broken reed he shall not break, and bedimmed flax shall he not quench it: he shall bring forth judgment to truth.
{42:4} He shall not be weak, and he shall not break, till he shall set judgment in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law:
{42:5} Thus said God Jehovah, creating the heavens and stretching them out; and spreading out the earth and its productions; giving breath to the people upon it, and spirit to those going upon it:
{42:6} I Jehovah called thee in justice, and I will hold by thy hand, and I will guard thee and give thee for a covenant of the people, for the light of the nations,
{42:7} To open the eyes of the blind, to bring forth the bound out of prison, those sitting in darkness out of the house of the prison.
{42:8} I Jehovah, this my name: and my glory I will not give to another, and my praise to carved images.
{42:9} The first things, behold, they came, and new things I announce: before they shall spring up I will cause you to hear.
{42:10} Sing ye to Jehovah a new song, and his praise from the extremity of the earth, ye going down to the sea, and its fulness; the isles and their inhabitants.
{42:11} The desert and its cities shall lift up, the enclosures shall Kedar inhabit: they inhabiting the rock shall shout for joy, from the head of the mountains they shall shout for joy.
{42:12} They shall set glory to Jehovah, and they shall announce his praise in the islands.
{42:13} Jehovah as a strong one shall go forth; as a man of war he shall raise up jealousy: he shall shout, also he shall cry aloud; he shall be strong against his enemies.
{42:14} I was silent of old; I will be still, I will restrain myself: as she bringing forth I will cry out; I will lay waste and snuff up together.
{42:15} I will lay waste mountains and hills, and I will dry up all their green herbage; and I set the rivers for islands, and I will dry up the pools.
{42:16} I brought the blind by a way they knew not; and I will cause them to tread in beaten paths they knew not: I will set darkness for light before them, and crooked ways into straightness; these words I did them, and I forsook them not.
{42:17} They were turned back, they will be ashamed with shame, trusting in the carved image, saying to the molten image, Thou our God.
{42:18} Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, to see.
{42:19} Who blind but my servant? and deaf as my messenger I shall send? who blind he being perfect? and blind as the servant of Jehovah?
{42:20} Seeing many things, and thou wilt not watch; opening the ears, and he will not bear.
{42:21} Jehovah was pleased for sake of his justice; he will magnify the law and make glorious.
{42:22} And this people was plundered and spoiled; snaring all of them in holes, and they were hid in houses of prisons: they were for plunder and none delivering; a treading down, and none said, Turn back.
{42:23} Who among you will give ear to this? and will attend and hear hereafter?
{42:24} Who gave Jacob for a treading down, and Israel for spoils? did not Jehovah against whom we sinned? and they would not go in his ways and they heard not to his laws.
{42:25} And be will pour upon him the heat of his anger, and the strength of war: and it will burn him from round about, and he will not know; and it will feed upon him and he will not lay to the heart.
{43:1} And now, thus said Jehovah creating thee, O Jacob, and forming thee, O Israel, Thou shalt not fear, for I redeemed thee; I called by thy name; thou art to me.
{43:2} When thou shalt pass through the waters, I with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou shalt go through fire thou shalt not be burnt, and the flame shall not consume thee.
{43:3} For I Jehovah thy God, the Holy One of Israel, saving thee: I gave Egypt expiating thee, Cush and Seba instead of thee.
{43:4} From that thou wert precious in mine eyes, thou wert honored, and I loved thee: and I will give man instead of thee, and peoples instead of thy soul.
{43:5} Thou shalt not fear, for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the sunrisings, and from the west I will gather thee.
{43:6} Say to the north, Thou shalt give, and to the south thou shalt not withhold: bring in my sons from far off, and my daughters from the extremities of the earth;
{43:7} All being called by name: and I created him; for my glory I formed him; also I made him.
{43:8} Bring forth the blind people, and there are eyes; and the deaf, and ears to them.
{43:9} Gather all nations together, and people shall be collected: who among them shall announce this, and will they cause us to hear former things? shall they give their witnesses, and be justified? and will they hear, and say, Truth?
{43:10} Ye my witnesses, says Jehovah, and my servants whom I chose: so that ye shall know and trust to me, and understand that I am he: before me was no God formed, and after me shall be none.
{43:11} I, I, Jehovah, and none saving besides me.
{43:12} I announced and I saved, and I caused to hear, and no stranger among you: and ye are witnesses, says Jehovah, and I am God.
{43:13} Also from the day I am he, and none delivering from my hand: I will do and who shall turn it back?
{43:14} Thus said Jehovah redeeming you, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I sent to Babel, and brought down the bars all of them, and the Chaldees shouting in their ships.
{43:15} I Jehovah your Holy One, creating Israel your king.
{43:16} Thus said Jehovah giving a way in the sea, and a beaten path in the strong waters;
{43:17} Bringing forth the chariot and the horse, the strength and the might together, they shall fall down, they shall not rise: they went out; they were quenched as tow.
{43:18} Will ye not remember the former things? will ye not discern the things of old?
{43:19} Behold me doing a new thing; now it shall spring forth, shall ye not know it? I will also set a way in the desert, rivers in the waste.
{43:20} The beast of the field shall know me, the sea monster and the daughters of the ostrich: for I gave waters in the desert, rivers in the waste to give drink to my people, my chosen.
{43:21} This people I formed for myself; they shall recount my praise.
{43:22} And thou calledst me not, O Jacob; and thou overt weary of me, O Israel.
{43:23} Thou broughtest not to me the sheep of thy burnt-offering, and thou honoredst me not with thy sacrifices I caused thee not to serve with a gift, and I wearied thee not with frankincense.
{43:24} Thou broughtest not for me a buying with silver, thou didst not satiate me with the fat of thy sacrifices also thou causedst me to serve with thy sins, thou didst weary me with thine iniquities.
{43:25} I, I am he wiping away thy transgressions for my sake, and I will not remember thy sins.
{43:26} Cause me to remember; we will judge together; relate thou so that thou shalt be justified.
{43:27} Thy first father sinned, thy interpreter transgressed against me.
{43:28} And will defile the chiefs of the holy place, and will give Jacob to be devoted, and Israel for reproaches.
{44:1} Hear now, O Jacob and Israel, whom I chose:
{44:2} Thus said Jehovah making thee, and forming thee from the belly, he will help thee; Thou shalt not be afraid, my servant Jacob, and Jeshurun whom I chose.
{44:3} For I will pour water upon the thirsty, and flowings upon the dry: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring.
{44:4} And they sprung up in the midst of the enclosure as willows by streams of water.
{44:5} This shall say, I to Jehovah; and this shall call in the name of Jacob; and this shall write his hand to Jehovah, and he shall address in the name of Israel.
{44:6} Thus said Jehovah king of Israel, and Jehovah of armies, redeeming him, I the first and I the last; and besides me no God.
{44:7} And who as I shall call and announce it, and set it in order for me from my placing the people of old? and the things coming and that shall come, they shall announce to them.
{44:8} Ye shall not tremble, and ye shall not be afraid: did I not from thence cause thee to hear? and I announced, and ye my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? and no rock; I knew not.
{44:9} They forming a carved image all of them emptiness; and their delights shall not profit, and they are their witnesses; they will not see and they will not know, so that they shall be ashamed.
{44:10} Who formed a god and a carved molten image, profiting for nothing?
{44:11} Behold, all his associates shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they from man, they shall be gathered together, all of them; they shall stand, they shall tremble, they shall be ashamed together.
{44:12} The workman of iron with an axe also worked with coal, and he will cleave it with hammers, and will work with the arm of his strength: also he hungered and no strength: he drank not water and was wearied.
{44:13} The workman of woods stretched out the line; he will delineate it with an awl, he will do it with chisels, and he will delineate it with a compass, and he will make it according to the image of a man, according to the beauty of man; to dwell in the house.
{44:14} To cut down for him cedars, and he will take the fir tree and the oak, and he will strengthen for himself among the trees of the forest: he planted an ash and the rain will cause to grow.
{44:15} And it was for a man to burn: and he will take from them and he will be warmed; also he will kindle, and bake bread; also he will make a god, and he will worship; he made it a carved image, and he will fall down to them.
{44:16} Half of it he burnt in the fire; upon half of it he will eat flesh; he will roast roast, and he will be satisfied: also he will be warm, and he will say, Aha, I was warm, I saw the light.
{44:17} And its remainder he made for a god, for his carved image: he will fall down to it, and he will worship and pray to it, and say, Deliver me, for thou my god.
{44:18} They will not know, and they will not discern: he spread over their eyes from seeing; their heart from considering.
{44:19} And none will set to his heart; and not knowledge, and not understanding to say, Half of it I burnt in the fire; and also I baked bread upon its coals; I will roast flesh and eat: and its remainder shall I make for an abomination? shall I fall down to a trunk of wood?
{44:20} He fed upon ashes: a deceived heart turned him away, and he shall not deliver his soul, and he shall not say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?
{44:21} Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I formed thee; a servant to me: thou Israel shalt not forget me.
{44:22} I wiped away as a cloud thy transgressions, and as a cloud thy sins: turn back to me for I redeemed thee.
{44:23} Shout, ye heavens, for Jehovah made: make a loud noise, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into a shout of joy, ye mountains, thou forest and every tree in it, for Jehovah redeemed Jacob, and he will be honored in Israel.
{44:24} Thus said Jehovah redeeming thee, and forming thee from the belly, I am Jehovah making all; stretching forth the heavens alone; spreading out the earth from myself:
{44:25} Bringing to naught the signs at vain boasters, and he will make those divining, foolish; turning back the wise backward, and he will frustrate their knowledge.
{44:26} Setting up the word of his servant, and he will complete the counsel of his messengers; saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be dwelt in; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and will raise up her wastes:
{44:27} Saying to the depth, Be thou dry, and I will dry up thy rivers.
{44:28} Saying to Cyrus, My shepherd, and he shall complete all my delight: and saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and the temple shall be founded.
{45:1} Thus said Jehovah to his Messiah, to Cyrus whom I held by his right hand to bring down nations before him; and I will loosen the loins of kings to open before him the doors; and the gates shall not be shut.
{45:2} I will go before thee, and I will make straight the circles: I will break in pieces the doors of brass, and I will cut down the bars of iron:
{45:3} And I gave to thee the treasures of darkness, and the hidden stores of lurking places, so that thou shalt know that I Jehovah calling by, thy name am the God of Israel.
{45:4} For sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, and I will call to thee by thy name: and I will address thee, and thou knewest me not.
{45:5} I am Jehovah, and none yet, no God besides me: I will gird thee and thou knewest me not:
{45:6} So that they shall know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that none besides me. I am Jehovah, and none yet.
{45:7} I shall form light and create darkness: making peace and creating evil: I Jehovah doing all these.
{45:8} Drop, ye heavens, from above, and the clouds shall shake out justice: the earth shall open, and they shall bring forth salvation, and justice shall spring up together; I Jehovah created it.
{45:9} Wo to him striving with him forming him! the potsherd with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him forming it, What wilt thou make? and thy work, No hands to it?
{45:10} Wo to him saying to the father, What wilt thou beget? and to the woman, What wilt thou bring forth?
{45:11} Thus said Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his potter, Ask me of things coming concerning the sons, and concerning the work of my hands will ye command me?
{45:12} I made the earth, and man upon it I created: my hand stretched forth the heavens, and all their army I commanded.
{45:13} I mused him up in justice, and I will make straight all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall send away my captivity, not by price and not by a gift, said Jehovah of armies.
{45:14} This said Jehovah, The labor of Egypt and the gain of Cush, and of the Sabeans, men of measure, shall pass over upon thee, and to thee shall they be: after thee shall they come in fetters: they shall pass over and to thee shall they worship and supplicate to thee, Surely God is in thee, and none yet: no God.
{45:15} Surely thou art God hiding thyself, the God of Israel, the Saviour.
{45:16} They were ashamed and also disgraced, all of them: together they went in shame the workmen of images.
{45:17} Israel was saved in Jehovah with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed and ye shall not be disgraced even to forever, forever.
{45:18} For thus said Jehovah creating the heavens, He the God forming the earth, and he made it; he prepared it, be created it not in vain, he formed it to be dwelt in: I Jehovah and none besides.
{45:19} I spake not in secret in a dark place of the earth: I said not to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I Jehovah speak justice, announcing straightnesses.
{45:20} Assemble ye together and come; draw ye near together, the escaped of the nations: they knew not lifting up the wood of their carved image, and praying to God he will not save.
{45:21} Announce ye, and bring near; also ye shall take counsel together: who caused this to be heard from of old, from then announcing it? was it not I Jehovah? and no God more beside me; a just God and Saviour; none beside me.
{45:22} Look to me all ye ends of the earth and be saved, for I am God, and none else.
{45:23} By myself I sware the word, justice went forth out of my mouth, and shall not turn back, That to me every knee shall bend, every tongue shall swear.
{45:24} Surely saying, In Jehovah to me justice and strength: even to him shall he come; and all being angry against him shall be ashamed.
{45:25} In Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.
{46:1} Bel bent; Nebo bowed down; their images were for the beast and for the cattle: your gifts were carried; a lifting up to the weary.
{46:2} They bowed down, they bent together; they were not able to deliver the burden and their soul went into captivity.
{46:3} Hear to me, ye house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, being carried from the belly, being lifted up from the womb:
{46:4} find even to old age I am he; and even to grayness I will bear; I made and I will lift up, and I will bear, and I will deliver.
{46:5} To whom will ye liken me and make equal? and compare me and we shall be like?
{46:6} Squandering gold out of the bag and they will weigh silver in the balance, they will hire a founder, and he will make it a god: they will fall down, they will also worship.
{46:7} They will lift him up upon the shoulder, they will carry him, they will set him down in his place and he will stand; from his place he shall not depart: also he will cry out to him and he will not answer; he will not save him from his straits.
{46:8} Remember this, shew yourselves men: turn back, ye transgressing, upon the heart.
{46:9} Remember the former things from forever: for I am God and no god besides, and none like me.
{46:10} Announcing the last part from the beginning, and from of old what was not done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my delight:
{46:11} Calling a ravenous beast from the sunrising, from a land afar off a man of my counsel: also I spake, also I will bring it; I formed, also I will do it.
{46:12} Hear to me, ye strong of heart, being far from justice.
{46:13} I brought near my justice; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not delay: and I gave salvation in Zion for Israel my beauty.
{47:1} Come down and sit upon the dust, thou virgin daughter of Babel, sit upon the earth: no throne, thou daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt not be added for them to call thee tender and delicate.
{47:2} Take the two mill-stones and grind flour, and uncover thy veil; strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.
{47:3} Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, also thy reproach shall be seen: I will take vengeance, I will not make peace with man.
{47:4} Jehovah of armies redeemed us, his name the Holy One of Israel.
{47:5} Sit thou silently and go into darkness, thou daughter of the Chaldeans for thou shalt no more be added for them to call thee The mistress of kingdoms.
{47:6} I was angry against my people; I defiled my inheritances, and I will give them into thine hand, and thou didst not set mercy to them; upon the old thou didst make heavy thy yoke greatly.
{47:7} And thou wilt say, I shall be mistress forever: till thou didst not set these upon thy heart, thou didst not remember its last part.
{47:8} And now hear this, thou living delicately, dwelling securely, saying in her heart, I, and none besides me; I shall not sit a widow, and I shall not know bereavement.
{47:9} And these two shall come to thee suddenly, in one day, bereavement and widowhood: as finished they came upon thee, in the multitude of thy sorceries, and in the great numbers of thy enchantments.
{47:10} And thou wilt trust in thy wickedness: thou saidst, None saw me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge it caused thee to turn away; and thou wilt say in thy heart, I, and none yet besides me.
{47:11} And evil came upon thee; thou shalt not know its dawn, and ruin shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to expiate it, and desolation shall suddenly come upon thee; thou shalt not know.
{47:12} Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries in which thou didst labor from thy youth; perhaps thou wilt be able to be of use, perhaps thou wilt cause fear.
{47:13} Thou wert wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Shall those searching out the heavens, those looking upon the stars, causing to know concerning the months, now stand and save thee from what shall come upon thee?
{47:14} Behold, they were as straw; the fire burnt them; they shall not deliver their soul from the hand of the flame: not a coal for warming, light to sit before it.
{47:15} Thus shall they be to thee for whom thou didst labor, thy merchants, from thy youth; they wandered a man to his other side; none saving thee.
{48:1} Hear this, ye house of Jacob, being called by the name of Israel, and from the water of Judah they came forth swearing by the name of Jehovah, and by the God of Israel they shall bring to remembrance, not in truth and not in justice.
{48:2} For they were called of the holy city, and rested themselves upon the God of Israel; Jehovah of armies his name.
{48:3} From then I announced the former things, and they went forth out of my Mouth, and I caused them to be heard; I did suddenly, and they shall come.
{48:4} From my knowledge that thou wert hard, and thy neck an iron sinew, and thy forehead of brass:
{48:5} I will announce to thee from then; before it shall come I caused thee to hear, lest thou shalt say, My image did them; and my carved image, and my Molten image commanded them.
{48:6} Thou heardest, seeing it all; and will ye not announce? I caused thee to hear new things from now, and hidden things, and thou knewest them not.
{48:7} Now were they created and not from then; and before the day and thou heardest them not; lest thou shalt say, Behold, I knew them.
{48:8} Also thou heardest not; also thou knewest not; also from then thine ear was not opened: for I knew, acting deceitfully, thou wilt act deceitfully, and it was called to thee transgressing from the womb.
{48:9} For sake of my name I will delay Mine anger; I will be muzzled towards thee, not cutting thee of.
{48:10} Behold, I purified thee and not with silver; I chose thee in the furnace of affliction.
{48:11} For my:sake, for my sake will I do: for how shall it be defiled? and I will not give my glory to another.
{48:12} Hear to me, O Jacob and Israel, my calling; I am he, I the firsts also I the last.
{48:13} Also my hand will found the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens: -I call to them, they shall stand together.
{48:14} Assemble, all ye, and hear; who among them announced these things? Jehovah loved him: he will do his delight upon Babel, and his arm upon the Chaldeans.
{48:15} I, I spake; also I called him: I brought him, and his way prospered.
{48:16} Draw ye near to me, hear this; I spake not in secret in the beginning; from the time of its being, there was I: and now the Lord Jehovah sent me, and his spirit.
{48:17} Thus said Jehovah redeeming thee, the Holy One of Israel: I Jehovah thy God teaching thee to profit, causing thee to tread in a way thou shalt go.
{48:18} Would thou didst attend to my commands! and thy peace shall be as a river, and thy justice as the billows of the sea.
{48:19} And thy seed shall be as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels as its bowels; his name shall not be cut off and shall not be destroyed from before me.
{48:20} Go ye forth from Babel; flee from the Chaldeans; with the voice of shouting, announce ye; cause this to be heard; cause it to go forth, even to the extremity o the earth; say ye, Jehovah redeemed his servant Jacob.
{48:21} And they thirsted not causing them to go in dry places: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: and he will cleave asunder the rock, and the waters will flow out.
{48:22} No peace, said Jehovah, to the unjust.
{49:1} Hear to me, ye islands, and attend ye people from far off; Jehovah called me from the belly; from my mother's bowels he made mention of my name.
{49:2} And he set my mouth as a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand he hid me, and he will set me for a polished arrow; in his quiver he hid me.
{49:3} And he will say to me, Thou my servant, Israel, whom I will be honored in thee.
{49:4} And I said, I labored in vain, for emptiness; and I finish my strength vainly; surely my judgment is with Jehovah and my work with my God.
{49:5} And now, said Jehovah, forming me from the belly for servant to him to turn back Jacob to him, And Israel shall not be gathered, and I shall be honored in the eyes of Jehovah, and God was my strength.
{49:6} And he will say, It was light thou being to me a servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to turn back the preserved of Israel: and I gave thee for a light of the nations to be my salvation even to the extremity of the earth.
{49:7} Thus said Jehovah redeeming Israel, his Holy One, to the despised of soul, to him being abhorred of the nations, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and princes arose, and they shall worship him for sake of Jehovah who was faithful, the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.
{49:8} Thus said Jehovah, In a time of acceptance I answered thee, and in the day of salvation I helped thee: and I will guard thee, and I will give thee for a covenant of the people to cause the earth to stand, to cause to inherit the inheritance of desolations,
{49:9} To say to the bound, Go forth; to those in darkness, Uncover yourselves. They shall feed upon the ways, and in all naked hills their pastures.
{49:10} They shall not hunger and they shall not thirst, and the heat shall not strike them, and the sun: for he pitying them shall lead them, and to fountains of water he shall conduct them.
{49:11} And I set all the mountains for a way, and the highways shall be raised up.
{49:12} Behold, these shall come from far off; and behold, these from the north, and from the sea; and these from the land of Sinim.
{49:13} Shout, ye heavens, and rejoice thou earth; and the mountains shall break forth with shouting: for Jehovah comforted his people and he will pity his afflicted.
{49:14} And Zion will say, Jehovah forsook me, and the Lord forgot me.
{49:15} Shall a woman forget her child, from pitying the son of her womb? also these shall forget, and I shall not forget thee.
{49:16} Behold, upon the palms I engraved thee; thy walls before me continually.
{49:17} Thy sons hastened; they destroying thee and laying thee waste shall come forth from thee.
{49:18} Lift up round about thine eyes and see: they all gathered themselves together, they came to thee. I live, says Jehovah, thou shalt put them all on as an ornament, and thou shalt bind them as a bride.
{49:19} For thy wastes and thy desolations, and the land of thy destruction, for now it shall press for the inhabitants, and they swallowing thee up were far away.
{49:20} Yet shall the sons of thy bereavement say in thine ears, The place is strait to me: draw near to me and I shall dwell.
{49:21} And thou saidst in thy heart, Who begat these to me, and I being bereaved and barren, an exile, and departing? and who caused these to grow? Behold, I was left alone; they, where were they?
{49:22} Thus said the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and to the peoples I will raise up my signal: and they brought thy sons in the bosom, and thy daughters shall be lifted up upon the shoulder.
{49:23} And kings were thy supporters, and princesses thy nurses: their faces to the earth they shall worship to thee, and the dust of thy feet shall they lick up; and thou knewest that I Jehovah, that they shall not be ashamed waiting for me.
{49:24} Shall the prey be taken from the strong? and if the captivity of the just shalt be delivered?
{49:25} For thus said Jehovah, Also the captivity of the strong shall be taken, and the prey of the terrible shall escape: and I will contend with him contending with thee, and thy sons I will save.
{49:26} And I will cause those oppressing thee to eat their own flesh, and they shall drink their blood to the full as new wine: and all flesh shall know that I am Jehovah saving thee, and redeeming thee, the Mighty One of Jacob.
{50:1} Thus said Jehovah, Where this writing of cutting off of your mother which I sent her away? or which of my creditors whom I sold you to him? Behold, in your iniquities ye sold yourselves, and in your transgressions your mother was sent away.
{50:2} Wherefore, I came, and no man? I called and none answered. Being short, was my hand shortened from redeeming? and if not power in me to deliver behold, in my rebuke I will dry up the sea; I will set the rivers a desert: their fish shall stink from no water, and they shall die with thirst.
{50:3} I will put darkness upon the heavens, and I will put sackcloth their covering.
{50:4} The Lord Jehovah gave to me the tongue of the expert to know to help the weary with a word: he will rouse up in the morning by morning, he will rouse up to me the ear to hear as the expert.
{50:5} The Lord Jehovah opened to me the ear and I opposed not, and I drew not back.
{50:6} My back I gave to those smiting, and my cheeks to those tearing out the hair: and my face I hid not from shame and spittle.
{50:7} And the Lord Jehovah will help to me: for this I was not ashamed; for this I set my face as the flint, and I shall know that I shall not be ashamed.
{50:8} He drawing near justifying me: who shall contend with me? we will stand together: who the lord of my judgment? he shall draw near to me.
{50:9} Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help for me; who is he that shall condemn me? behold, they all shall decay as a garment; the moth shall eat them.
{50:10} Who among you fearing Jehovah, hearing to the voice of his servant? who goes in darkness and no light to him? he shall trust in the name of Jehovah and rest upon his God.
{50:11} Behold, all ye kindling a fire, girding yourselves with fiery darts: go ye in the light of your fire, and in the fiery darts ye kindled. From my hand was this to you; ye shall lie down for sorrow.
{51:1} Hear to me, ye pursuing justice, seeking Jehovah: look to the rock ye hewed, and at the quarry of the pit ye dug out.
{51:2} Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah bringing you forth: for one I called him, and I will bless him, and I will increase him.
{51:3} For Jehovah comforted Zion: he comforted all her wastes, and he will set her desert as Eden, and her sterile region as the garden of Jehovah; joy and gladness shall be found in her confession, and the voice of song.
{51:4} Attend to me, my people, and give ear to me, my nation: for a law shall go forth from me, and I will cause my judgment to rest for the light of the peoples.
{51:5} My justice is near; my salvation went forth, and mine arms shall judge the peoples; the islands shall wait for me, and to mine arm shall they hope.
{51:6} Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look to the earth from beneath: for the heavens as smoke vanished away, and the earth as a garment shall decay, and they inhabiting as thus shall die; and my salvation shall be forever, and my justice shall not be broken.
{51:7} Hear to me, ye knowing justice, the people my law in their heart; ye shall not fear the reproach of men; and from their reviling ye shall not be dismayed.
{51:8} For the moth shall eat them as a garment, and as wool shall the moth eat them: and my justice shall be forever, and my salvation to generation of generations.
{51:9} Rouse up, rouse up, put on strength, thou arm of Jehovah; rouse up as the days of old, of everlasting generations. Was it not with him cutting off Rahab, wounding the sea monster?
{51:10} Was it not with him desolating the sea, the water of the great deep? setting the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?
{51:11} And the redeemed of Jehovah shall turn back, and they came to Zion with shouting and eternal joy upon their head: and gladness and joy shall they attain; sorrow and sighing fled.
{51:12} I, I am he comforting you: who thou? and shalt thou be afraid of man he shall die, and of the son of man shall be given for grass?
{51:13} And shalt thou forget Jehovah making thee, stretching out the heavens and founding the earth? and thou wilt tremble continually all the day from the face of the anger of him pressing as being prepared to destroy: and where the wrath of him pressing?
{51:14} He being bowed down hastened to be loosed, and he will not die in the pit, and his bread shall not fail.
{51:15} And I am Jehovah thy God causing the sea to tremble. And its billows shall be put in motion: Jehovah of armies his name.
{51:16} And I will put my word in thy mouth, and in the shadow of my hand I covered thee, to plant the heavens and to found the earth, and to say to Zion, Thou my people.
{51:17} Arise, arise, stand up, O Jerusalem, who drank from the hand of Jehovah the cup of his wrath; thou didst drink the goblet cup of reeling, pressing out.
{51:18} None providing for her of all the sons she brought forth; and none holding by her hand of all the sons she caused to grow.
{51:19} These two encountering thee; who shall be moved for thee? desolation and breaking, and famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?
{51:20} Thy sons fainted; they lay down upon the head of all the streets as an antelope in a net: being full of the wrath of Jehovah the rebuke of thy God.
{51:21} For this, bear now this, thou afflicted and drunken, and not from wine:
{51:22} Thus said thy Lord Jehovah and thy God, he will contend for his people, Behold, I took from thy hand the cup of reeling, the goblet cup of my wrath; thou shalt not add to drink it more.
{51:23} And I put it in the hand of those afflicting thee; who said to thy soul, Bow down, and we will pass over; thou wilt set thy middle as the earth, and as the street to those passing over.
{52:1} Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on the garments of thy glory, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for the uncircumcised shall no more add to come into thee, and the unclean.
{52:2} Shake thyself from dust: arise, sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bonds of thy neck, thou captive daughter of Zion.
{52:3} For thus said Jehovah, Ye sold yourselves gratuitously, and ye shall not be redeemed with silver.
{52:4} Thus said the Lord Jehovah, My people at first went down to Egypt to sojourn there, and Assur oppressed them for nothing.
{52:5} And now what to me here, says Jehovah, that my people were taken gratuitously? ruling, they will cause to give a sharp sound, says Jehovah; and continually all the day my name being despised.
{52:6} For this, my people shall know my name: for this in that day, for I am he speaking: behold me.
{52:7} How exalted upon the mountains the feet of him announcing good news, causing peace to be beard: announcing good news of good, causing salvation to be heard; saying to Zion, Thy God reigns!
{52:8} They watching thee lifted up the voice; the voice together they will shout: for they shall see eye to eye in Jehovah's turning back Zion.
{52:9} Break forth into joy, shout together, ye wastes of Jerusalem, for Jehovah comforted his people, he redeemed Jerusalem.
{52:10} Jehovah uncovered his holy arm to the eyes of all nations, and all the ends of the earth saw the salvation of our God.
{52:11} Turn aside, turn aside, come ye forth from thence; ye shall not touch the unclean thing; come forth from the midst of her; be separated ye lifting up the vessels of Jehovah.
{52:12} For ye shall not come forth with haste, and in flight ye shall not go; for Jehovah goes before you, and he gathering you the God of Israel.
{52:13} Behold, my servant shall be wise, he shall be exalted, and lifted up, and be high exceedingly.
{52:14} As many were astonished at thee, his appearance being so spoiled from man, and his form from the sons of men.
{52:15} So shall he cause many nations to rejoice for him; kings shall shut their mouth; for what was not recounted to them they saw; and what they heard not, they considered.
{53:1} Who believed in our report? and to whom was the arm of Jehovah uncovered?
{53:2} He shall come up as a sucking child before him, and as a root out of a land of dryness: no form to him and no decoration; and we shall see him, and no appearance and we shall desire him.
{53:3} He was despised and forsaken of men; a man of griefs and knowing affliction: and as hiding the faces from him; he was despised and we regarded him not.
{53:4} Surely he lifted up our afflictions, and our griefs he carried them: and we reckoned him to be smitten, struck of God, and afflicted.
{53:5} And he being wounded for our transgressions, and crushed from our iniquities; the correction of our peace upon him, and in the marks of his stripes it was healed to us.
{53:6} All we as sheep went astray; we turned a man to his way; and Jehovah caused the iniquity of us all to fall upon him.
{53:7} He was pressed, and he was afflicted, and he will not open his mouth: he was brought as a sheep for the slaughter, and as a sheep before his shearers being dumb and he will not open his mouth.
{53:8} From constraint and from judgment was he taken, and his generation who shall comprehend? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he struck for them.
{53:9} And he will give with the unjust his grave, and with the rich in his deaths, for he did no violence, and no deceit in his mouth.
{53:10} And Jehovah inclined to crash him; piercing him when his soul shall be set a sacrifice for sin, he shall see seed, he shall prolong the days, and the delight of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand.
{53:11} And be shall see of the labor of his soul, he shall be satisfied: by his knowledge my just servant shall justify for many; and he shall bear their iniquities.
{53:12} For this I will divide to him with many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; for which his soul was poured out to death, and he was numbered with transgressors; and he lifted up the sin of many, and he will supplicate for transgressors.
{54:1} Shout, thou barren, not bringing forth; break forth in shouting, cry aloud, not being pained; for more the sons of the desolate than the sons of the married, said Jehovah.
{54:2} Enlarge the place of thy tent, stretch forth the hangings of thy dwellings; thou shalt not spare; lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy pegs.
{54:3} For the right and the left thou shalt break forth, and thy seed shall inherit the nations, and they shall cause desolated cities to be inhabited.
{54:4} Thou shalt not fear; for thou shalt not be ashamed: and thou shalt not be disgraced, and thou shalt not be put to shame, for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and thou shalt no more remember the reproach of thy widowhood.
{54:5} For thy Lord making thee; Jehovah of armies his name; and he redeeming thee, the Holy One of Israel; the God of the earth shall he be called.
{54:6} As a wife forsaken and grieved of spirit Jehovah called thee, and a wife of youth; for thou shalt be rejected, said thy God.
{54:7} In a little moment I forsook thee; and with great mercies I will gather thee.
{54:8} In the outpouring of anger I hid a moment my face from thee; and in eternal mercy I compassionated thee, said Jehovah redeeming thee.
{54:9} For this the water of Noah to me: as I sware to the water of Noah from again passing over the earth; thus I sware from being angry against thee and from rebuking upon thee.
{54:10} For the mountains shall remove and the hills shall waver; and my mercy shall not remove from thee, and the covenant of my peace shall not waver, said Jehovah compassionating thee.
{54:11} Thou afflicted, tossed about, not comforted behold me laying thy stones with paint, and I founded thee with sapphires.
{54:12} And I set thy battlements the ruby, and thy gates in stones of sparkling, and all thy bound in stones of delight.
{54:13} And all thy sons taught of Jehovah; and much the peace of thy sons.
{54:14} In justice shalt thou be prepared: go far off from violence; for thou shalt not be afraid: and from terror, for it shall not draw near to thee.
{54:15} Behold, gathering, it shall gather together, not from me: who sojourned with thee shall fall for thee.
{54:16} Behold, I created the workman blowing the coals in the fire, and bringing forth a utensil for his work; and I created the destroyer to overthrow.
{54:17} Every vessel formed against thee shall not prosper: and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This the inheritance of the servants of Jehovah, and their justice is from me, says Jehovah.
{55:1} Ho, every one thirsting, Come ye to the waters, and whom there is not to him silver, come ye, buy and eat; and come ye, and buy without silver and without price, wine and milk.
{55:2} Wherefore will ye weigh silver without bread? and your labour not for fulness? hearing, hear ye to me, and eat good, and your soul shall delight in fatness.
{55:3} Incline your ear, and come to me, and hear, and your soul shall live; and I will cut out with you an eternal covenant, the sure mercies of David.
{55:4} Behold, I gave him a witness of the nations, a leader and commanding the nations.
{55:5} Behold, nations thou shalt not know; thou shalt call, and nations that knew thee not shall run to thee, for sake of Jehovah thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he honored thee.
{55:6} Seek ye Jehovah in his being found, and call him in his being near.
{55:7} The unjust one shall forsake his way, and the man of vanity his purposes, and turn back to Jehovah, and he will pity him, and to our God, for he will multiply to forgive.
{55:8} For not my purposes your purposes and not your ways my ways, says Jehovah.
{55:9} As the heavens were high above the earth, so my ways were high above your ways, and my purposes above your purposes.
{55:10} For as the rain coming down and the snow from the heavens, and shall not turn back there, but watering the earth and causing it to bring forth and sprout, and giving seed to be sown, and bread to be eaten;
{55:11} So shall be my word which went forth out of my mouth: it shall not turn back to me empty, but doing what I delighted in, and it shall prosper for what I send it.
{55:12} For with joy shall ye go forth, and in peace shall ye be led forth; the mountains and hills shall break forth before you into shouting, and all the trees of the field shall clap the hand.
{55:13} Instead of the thorn-hedge shall come up the cypress; of the briar shall come up the myrtle: and it was to Jehovah for a name for an eternal sigh; it shall not be cut off.
{56:1} Thus said Jehovah, Watch ye judgment and do justice; for my salvation drew near to come, and my justice to be uncovered.
{56:2} Happy the man that shall do this, and the son of man that shall lay hold upon it; watching the Sabbath from defiling it, and watching his hand from doing all evil.
{56:3} And the son of the stranger joining himself to Jehovah, shall not say, saying, Jehovah separating, will separate me from his people; and the eunuch shall not say, Behold me a dry tree.
{56:4} For thus said Jehovah to the eunuchs who shall watch my Sabbaths, and choose in what I delighted, and taking hold upon my covenant;
{56:5} And I gave to them in my house and in my walls a hand and a name good above sons and above daughters: an eternal name will I give to him which shall not be cut off.
{56:6} And the sons of the stranger joining themselves to Jehovah to serve him, and to love the name of Jehovah, to be to him for servants, every one watching the Sabbath from defiling it, and taking hold upon my covenant;
{56:7} And I brought them to my holy mountain, and I made them rejoice in the house of my prayer: their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices for acceptance upon mine altar; for my house shall be called the house of prayer for all the peoples.
{56:8} Says the Lord Jehovah gathering the outcasts of Israel, Yet will I gather to him to his gathered.
{56:9} All ye beasts of the fields, come ye to eat; all ye beasts in the forest.
{56:10} Look about, ye blind; they all knew not, they all dumb dogs, they shall not be able to bark; dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.
{56:11} And dogs hard of soul, they knew not fulness; and they are evil, they know not understanding; they all looked to their way, a man to his plunder from his extremity.
{56:12} Come ye, I will take wine, and we will drink strong drink to excess; and the morrow being as this day, the remainder great exceedingly.
{57:1} The just one perished and none put upon the heart: men of kindness being taken away, for none understanding that the just one was taken away from the face of evil.
{57:2} He shall come into peace: they shall rest upon their beds, he went in his justice.
{57:3} And ye, come ye near here, sons of her practicing magic, seed of the adulterer and the harlot.
{57:4} Against whom will ye deride? against whom will ye make broad the mouth, will ye thrust out the tongue? are ye not children of transgressing and a seed of falsehood?
{57:5} Being comforted with gods under every green tree, slaughtering the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?
{57:6} In the smoothnesses of the torrent they thy portion, they thy lot; also to them thou didst pour out a libation, thou didst bring up a gift Shall I be comforted with these?
{57:7} Upon a mountain high and lifted up thou didst set thy bed: also there thou wentest up to sacrifice a sacrifice.
{57:8} Behind the doors and the door-post thou didst set thy memorial: for from me thou didst migrate, and thou wilt go up; thou didst make broad thy bed, and thou wilt cut out to thee from them; thou didst love their bed; thou didst look upon the hand.
{57:9} And thou wilt pour out for the king with oil and thou wilt increase thy perfumes, and thou wilt send thy messengers even from far off, and thou wilt be made low, even to hades.
{57:10} In the abundance of thy way thou wert wearied; thou midst, Not to give over; thou didst find the living of thy hand; for this, thou wert not pained.
{57:11} And whom didst thou fear? and wilt thou be afraid? for thou wilt lie, and thou didst not remember me; thou didst not put it upon thy heart; was not I being silent and from of old, and thou wilt not be afraid of me?
{57:12} I will announce thy justice and thy works, and they shall not profit thee.
{57:13} In thy crying out, shall thy gatherings deliver thee? and the wind shall lift them all up; a breath shall take: and he taking refuge in me shall inherit the land, and he shall inherit my holy mountain;
{57:14} And he shall say, Lift ye up, lift ye up; clear the way, take up the stumbling block out of the way of my people.
{57:15} For thus said the high and lifted up inhabiting eternity, and his name Holy; being lifted up, and I will dwell in the holy place, and with the broken and humble of spirit, to preserve alive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the broken.
{57:16} For not forever will I contend, and not to everlasting will I be angry: for the spirit will faint from before me, and the lives I made.
{57:17} For the iniquity of his plunder was I angry, and I will smite him: covering myself, and I will be angry, and he went turning away in the way of his heart.
{57:18} I saw his ways, and I will heal him: and I will lead him and I will restore comforts to him, and to his mourners.
{57:19} Creating the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him being far off, and to him being near, said Jehovah; and I healed him.
{57:20} And the unjust as the tossed sea when it shall not be able to rest, and its waters will toss up mud and mire;
{57:21} no peace, said God, to the unjust.
{58:1} Call with the throat; thou shalt not spare; as a trumpet lift up thy voice, and announce to my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sin.
{58:2} And day, day, they will seek me, and delight to know my way as a nation who did justice and forsook not the judgment of his God: they will ask me the judgments of justice, they will delight to draw near to Gad.
{58:3} For what did we fast, and thou sawest not? we humbled our soul and thou wilt not know? Behold, in the day of your fasting ye will find desire, and ye will exact all your labors.
{58:4} Behold, for contention and strife ye will fast, and to strike with the fist of injustice: ye shall not fast as today to cause your voice to be heard on high.
{58:5} Will this be the fast I shall choose? a day for a man to humble his soul? to bend his head as a bulrush, and he will place sackcloth and ashes? wilt thou call this a fast and a day of acceptance to Jehovah.
{58:6} Is not this the fast I shall choose? to loose the bands of injustice, to shake off the bundles of the yoke, and to send away the broken free, and ye shall break every yoke?
{58:7} Is it not to break thy bread to the hungry, and thou shalt bring the wandering poor to thy house? when thou shalt see the naked and cover him; and thou shalt not hide from thy flesh.
{58:8} Then shall thy light break forth as the dawn, and thy healing shall spring forth quickly: and thy justice going before thee; the glory of Jehovah shall gather thee.
{58:9} Then shalt thou call and Jehovah will answer; thou shalt cry for help, and he will say, Behold me. If thou shalt take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the extending of the finger, and the word of vanity;
{58:10} And thou shalt give out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the humble soul; and thy light rising in darkness, and thy thick darkness as the noon.
{58:11} And Jehovah led thee continually, and he satisfied thy soul in dry places, and he will make thy bones strong: and thou wert as a watered garden, and as a spring of water which its waters shall not deceive.
{58:12} And from thee the old wastes were built; the foundations of generation and generation thou shalt raise them up, and it was called to thee, Walling the breach, Turning back the beaten paths to dwell in.
{58:13} If thou shalt turn back thy foot from the Sabbath, doing thy delight in my holy day; and thou calledst to the Sabbath a delight for the holy of Jehovah, being honored; and thou honoredst him from doing thy ways, from finding thy delight, and speaking the word.
{58:14} Then shalt thou delight thyself in Jehovah, and I caused thee to ride upon the heights of the earth, and I caused thee to eat the inheritance of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of Jehovah spake.
{59:1} Behold, the hand of Jehovah was not shortened from saving, and his ear heavy from hearing:
{59:2} But your iniquities were separating between you and between your God, and your sins caused to hide the face from you from hearing.
{59:3} For your hands were polluted with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips spake falsehood, your tongue will mutter evil.
{59:4} None called upon justice, and none judged in truth: trusting in vanity and speaking evil, they conceived labor and brought forth vanity.
{59:5} They plundered vipers eggs, and they will weave spiders webs: he eating from their eggs shall die, and being crushed, it shall break forth a viper.
{59:6} Their webs shall not be for a garment, and they shall not be covered with their works: their works the works of vanity, and the work of violence in their hands.
{59:7} Their feet will run to evil, and they will hasten to pour out innocent blood: their purposes, purposes of vanity; destruction and breaking in their highways.
{59:8} The way of peace they knew not, and no judgment in their paths: they perverted their beaten paths for themselves: every one treading in it shall not know peace.
{59:9} For this judgment was far off from us, and justice shall not overtake us: we shall wait for light, and behold, darkness; for brightness, and we shall walk in thick darkness.
{59:10} We shall feel for the wall as the blind, and we shall feel, as no eyes: we stumbled at noon as at evening twilight; in fertile fields as the dead.
{59:11} We shall growl as bears all of us, and murmuring we shall murmur as doves: we shall wait for judgment, and none; for salvation, it was far from us.
{59:12} For our transgressions were multiplied before thee, and our sins answered against us: for our transgressions are with us, and our iniquities we knew them.
{59:13} Transgressing and lying against Jehovah, and departing from after our God, speaking violence and apostasy, they conceived and muttered from the heart words of falsehood.
{59:14} And judgment was turned away behind, and justice shall stand from far off: for truth fainted in the street, and right will not be able to come in.
{59:15} And truth shall be lacking; and he departing from evil being plundered: and Jehovah will see, and it will be evil in his eyes, for no judgment.
{59:16} And he will see that not a man, and he will be astonished that none was supplicating: and his arm will save for him, and his justice it upheld him.
{59:17} And he will put on justice as a coat of mail, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and be will put on robes of vengeance a garment, and he will clothe himself with zeal as an upper garment.
{59:18} According to the works, accordingly he will recompense, wrath to his adversaries, recompense, to his enemies; to the islands will he requite recompense.
{59:19} And from the west they shall fear the name of Jehovah, and from the rising of the sun, his glory. When the adversary shall come in as a river, the spirit of Jehovah was lifted up against him.
{59:20} And be redeeming came to Zion, and they turning away transgression in Jacob, says Jehovah.
{59:21} And I, this my covenant with them, said Jehovah: my spirit which is upon thee, and my word which I put in thy mouth shall not depart from thy mouth, and from the mouth of thy seed, from the mouth of thy seed's seed, said Jehovah, from now and even forever.
{60:1} Arise, shine, for thy light has come, and the glory of Jehovah has risen upon thee.
{60:2} For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gloom the nations: and Jehovah shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.
{60:3} And nations shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.
{60:4} Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: they all gathered together, they came to thee: thy sons shall come from far off, and thy daughters shall be supported upon the side.
{60:5} Then thou shalt see and flow together, and thy heart shall fear and be enlarged; for the multitude of the sea shall turn to thee, the strength of the nations shall come to thee.
{60:6} An abundance of camels shall cover thee, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all they from Seba shall come: they shall lift up gold and frankincense; they shall announce good news, the praises of Jehovah.
{60:7} All the sheep of Kedar shall be gathered together to thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall serve thee: they shall go up for acceptance to mine altar and I will adorn the house of my glory.
{60:8} Who are these? they will fly as a cloud, and as doves to their lattices.
{60:9} For the islands shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish among the first to bring thy sons from far off, their silver and their gold with them, to the name of Jehovah thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he honored thee.
{60:10} And the sons of the stranger built thy walls, and their kings shall serve thee: for in my wrath I struck thee, and in mine acceptance I compassionated thee.
{60:11} And thy gates were opened continually; day and night they shall not be shut; to bring to thee the strength of the nations, and their kings being led on.
{60:12} For the nation and the kingdom which will not serve thee shall perish; and the nations shall be laid waste with the sword.
{60:13} The glory of Lebanon shall come to thee, the cypress, the plane tree, and the box tree together, to adorn my holy place; and I will honor the place of my foot.
{60:14} And sons humbling thee came bowing down to thee: and all they despising thee worshiped at the soles of thy feet; and they called thee, The city of Jehovah, Zion, the Holy One of Israel.
{60:15} Because of thy being forsaken and hated, and none passed through, and I set thee for a perpetual excellency, the joy of generation and generation.
{60:16} And thou didst suck the milk of nations, and thou shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou knewest that I am Jehovah, saving thee and redeeming thee, the Mighty One of Jacob.
{60:17} Instead of brass I will bring gold, and instead of iron I will bring silver, and instead of woods, brass, and instead of stones, iron: and I set thine overseers peace, and thy rulers justice.
{60:18} Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation and breaking in thy bounds: and thou calledst thy walls Salvation, and thy gates, Praise.
{60:19} The sun shall be no more to thee for light by day, and for brightness the moon shall not shine to thee: and Jehovah was to thee for an eternal light, and thy God for thy glory.
{60:20} Thy sun shall no more go down, and thy moon shall not withdraw, for Jehovah shall be to thee for an eternal light, and the days of thy mourning were finished.
{60:21} And thy people all of them just: forever shall they inherit the land, watching his planting, the work of my hand for glory.
{60:22} The little one shall be for a thousand, and the small for a strong nation: I Jehovah will hasten it in its time.
{61:1} The spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah anointed me to announce good news to the afflicted, he sent me to bind up to the broken of heart, to call freedom to the captives, and the opening of the prison to the bound.
{61:2} To call the year of acceptance to Jehovah, and the day of vengeance to our God; to comfort all those mourning;
{61:3} To set to those mourning in Zion, to give to them adorning instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, the vestment of praise for the spirit of faintness; and it shall be called to them, The mighty trees of justice of the planting of Jehovah, to be honored.
{61:4} And they shall build the perpetual wastes; they shall raise up the former desolations, and they renewed the cities of the waste, the desolations of generation and generation.
{61:5} And strangers stood and fed your sheep, and the sons of the stranger, your husbandmen and your vinedressers.
{61:6} And ye shall be called the priests of Jehovah, serving our God; he shall say to you, Ye shall eat the strength of the nations, and ye shall take place in their honor.
{61:7} For your shame the second place; and they shall rejoice in reproach, their portion: for this in their land they shall inherit the second place; eternal joy shall be to them.
{61:8} For I Jehovah love judgment, hating robbery for burnt-offering; and I gave their works in truth, and I will cut out to them an eternal covenant.
{61:9} And their seed was known among the nations, and their offspring in the midst of the peoples: all seeing them shall recognise them, for they the seed Jehovah blessed.
{61:10} Rejoicing, I will rejoice in Jehovah, my soul shall exult in my God, for he put upon me the garments of salvation, and he clothed me with a robe of justice, as a bridegroom will be a priest with a turban, and as a bride will be adorned with her dress.
{61:11} For as the earth will bring forth her sprout, and as a garden will cause the things sown to sprout, so the Lord Jehovah will cause justice and praise to sprout before all nations.
{62:1} For sake of Zion I will not be silent, and for sake of Jerusalem I will not rest till its justice shall go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a flame shall burn.
{62:2} And the nations shall see thy justice, and all kings thy glory: and a new name shall be called to thee which the mouth of Jehovah shall name it.
{62:3} And thou wert a crown of glory in the hand of Jehovah, and a tiara of royalty in the hand of thy God.
{62:4} It shall no more be said to thee, Forsaken; and to thy land it shall no more be said, Desolation; for it shall be called to thee, My delight in her, and to thy land, Married: for Jehovah delighted in thee, and thy land shall be married.
{62:5} As a young man will marry a virgin, thy sons shall marry thee: and the bridegroom rejoicing over the bride, thy God will rejoice over thee.
{62:6} I appointed those watching over thy walls, O Jerusalem: all the day and all the night continually they shall not be silent: ye remembering Jehovah, no stillness to you.
{62:7} And ye shall not give rest to him till he shall prepare, and till he shall set Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
{62:8} Jehovah sware by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, If I shall give more thy grain for food to thine enemies, and if the sons of the stranger shall drink thy new wine which thou didst labor for it:
{62:9} For they gathering it shall eat it, and praise Jehovah; and they collecting it shall drink it in the enclosures of my holy place.
{62:10} Pass through, pass through in the gates; clear ye the way of the people; lift up, lift up the highway; free it from stone; raise up a signal for the peoples.
{62:11} Behold, Jehovah caused to be heard to the extremity of the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation coming: behold, his reward with him, and his work before his face.
{62:12} And they called to them, The holy people, redeemed of Jehovah: and it shall be called to thee, A city sought for: not forsaken.
{63:1} Who this coming from Edom, splendid with garments from Bozra? this adorned in his attire, bowing himself in his strength? I, speaking in justice, great for salvation.
{63:2} Wherefore red to thine attire, and thy garments as he treading in the wine press?
{63:3} I trod the wine-press alone; and from the people not a man with me: and I will tread them down in my wrath, and I will trample them in mine anger, and their juice shall be sprinkled upon my garment, and I will stain all my vestment.
{63:4} For the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redemption came.
{63:5} And I shall look, and none helping; and I shall be astonished and none upholding: and my arm will save for me, and my wrath it upheld me.
{63:6} And I will tread down peoples in mine anger; and I will make them drunk in my wrath, and I will bring down their juice to the earth.
{63:7} I will remember the mercies of Jehovah, the praises of Jehovah according to all that Jehovah benefited us, and the abundance of good to the house of Israel which he benefited them according to his mercies and according to the multitude of his kindnesses.
{63:8} And he will say, Surely they my people, sons that will not lie: and he will be to them for Saviour.
{63:9} In all their straits not an adversary, and: a messenger of his face saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he will take them up and bear them all the days forever.
{63:10} They embittered and grieved his holy spirit; and he will turn to them for an enemy; he fought against them.
{63:11} And he will remember the days of old, Moses his people; Where he bringing them up from the sea with the shepherd of his sheep? where he putting his holy spirit in the midst of him?
{63:12} Leading by the right hand of Moses, the arm of his glory dividing the waters from before them to make to him an eternal name.
{63:13} Leading them through the depths as a horse in the desert, they shall not be weak.
{63:14} As cattle in the valley the spirit of Jehovah will come down, it will cause us to rest: so thou didst lead thy people, to make to thee a name of glory.
{63:15} Look from the heavens, and see from thy holy dwelling and thy glory: where thy zeal and thy strength? the multitude of thy bowels and thy compassions to me restrained themselves.
{63:16} For thou our Father, for Abraham knew us not, and Israel will not recognize us: thou Jehovah our Father redeeming us; thy name from eternity.
{63:17} Wherefore, O Jehovah, wilt thou cause us to wander from thy ways, wilt thou harden our heart from thy fear? turn back for sake of thy servants, the tribes of thine inheritance.
{63:18} For a little While the people of thy holy place possessed it: our adversaries trod down thy holy place.
{63:19} We were from of old: thou didst not rule with them; thy name was not called upon them.
{64:1} Would that thou didst rend the heavens; thou camest down; the mountains flowed from before thee.
{64:2} As the fire of meltings was kindled the fire will cause the water to boil, to cause thy name to be known to thine adversaries; from thy face shall the nations be moved.
{64:3} In thy doing wonderful things we shall not expect, thou camest down, the mountains flowed from before thee.
{64:4} From forever they heard not, they gave not ear, the eye saw not, O God, besides thee, he will do to him waiting for him.
{64:5} Thou mettest him rejoicing and doing justice, they shall remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wert angry; and we shall sin in them of old, and we shall be saved.
{64:6} And we were all as the unclean, and all our justice as the garment of monthly courses; and we shall all fail away as the leaf; and our iniquities as the wind will take us away.
{64:7} And none calling upon thy name, none rousing himself to take hold upon thee: for thou hiddest thy face from us, and thou wilt melt us by the hand of our iniquities.
{64:8} And now, O Jehovah, thou our Father; we the clay and thou forming us; and we all the work of thy hand.
{64:9} Thou wilt not be angry, O Jehovah, even greatly, and not forever wilt thou remember iniquity: behold, look now, Ye are all thy people.
{64:10} The cities of thy holy place were desert; Zion was a desert, Jerusalem a desolation.
{64:11} The house of our holy place and our glory where our fathers praised thee, was for a burning of fire, and all our precious things were for desolation.
{64:12} For these wilt thou refrain thyself, O Jehovah? wilt thou be silent, and wilt thou humble us even greatly?
{65:1} I was sought by them they asked not; I was found by them not seeking me: I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation not calling upon my name.
{65:2} I spread forth my hands all the day to a perverse people, going the way not good, after their purposes.
{65:3} The people irritating me to my face continually; sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks;
{65:4} Dwelling among the graves, and they will lodge among the watchers, eating swine's flesh, and broth of unclean things in their vessels.
{65:5} Saying, Come near to thyself; thou shalt not touch upon me, for I was clean to thee. These a smoke in my wrath, a fire burning all the day.
{65:6} Behold, it written before me: I will not be silent, but I requited, and I requited upon their bosom,
{65:7} Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together, said Jehovah, who burnt incense upon the mountains, and upon the hills they reproached me: and I measured their former work upon their bosom.
{65:8} Thus said Jehovah, As the new wine will be found in the cluster, and he will say, Thou shalt not destroy it, for a blessing in it: thus will I do for sake of my servant, to not destroy them all.
{65:9} And I brought forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah he shall inherit my mountain: and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell their.
{65:10} And Sharon was for a dwelling of sheep, and the valley of Achor for a resting place of the herd, for my people who sought me.
{65:11} And ye forsaking Jehovah, forgetting my holy mountain, and preparing a table for Gad, and filling up for fate from mixed wine.
{65:12} And I numbered you to the sword, and ye all shall bend to the slaughter, because I called, and ye answered not: I spake and ye heard not; and ye will do evil in mine eyes, and in what I delighted not, ye chose.
{65:13} For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants shall eat and ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink and ye shall thirst: behold, my servants shall rejoice, and ye shall be ashamed.
{65:14} Behold, my servants shall shout from good of heart, but ye shall cry from pain of heart, and wail from breaking of spirit.
{65:15} And ye set down your name for a curse to my chosen: and the Lord Jehovah slaying thee, and he will call his servants another name.
{65:16} That he praising himself in the earth shall praise himself in the true God; and he swearing in the earth, shall swear in the true God; for the former straits were forgotten, and because they were hid from mine eyes.
{65:17} For behold me creating new heavens and a new earth: and the former things shall not be remembered, and they shall not come upon the heart.
{65:18} But be ye glad and rejoice even forever, for what I create: for behold me creating Jerusalem a joy, and her people a rejoicing.
{65:19} And I rejoiced in Jerusalem, and was glad in my people; and the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her, and the voice of crying.
{65:20} There shall be no more from thence a child of days, and an old man who shall not fill up his days: for the boy shall die the son of a hundred years and he sinning, the son of a hundred years, shall be cursed.
{65:21} And they built houses and they dwelt in them; and they planted vineyards, and they ate the fruit.
{65:22} They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat: for as the days of a tree the days of my people, and my chosen shall wear out the work of their hands.
{65:23} They shall not labor in vain, and they shall not bring forth for terror; for they the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.
{65:24} And it was before they shall call, I will answer; they yet speaking, and I will hear.
{65:25} The wolf and the lamb shall feed as one, and the lion and the ox shall eat straw, and the serpent, dust his bread. They shall not do evil, and they shall not destroy in all my holy mountain, said Jehovah.
{66:1} Thus said Jehovah, The heavens my throne, and the earth the footstool of my feet: where this house which ye will build to me? and where this place of my rest?
{66:2} And all these my hand made, and all these shall be, says Jehovah: and to this will I look, to the humble and smitten of spirit, and trembling at my word.
{66:3} He slaughtering the ox, striking a man; he sacrificing a sheep, broke a dog's neck; he bringing up a gift, swine's blood; he making remembrance of frankincense, praising vanity; also they chose their ways, and in their abominations their soul delighted.
{66:4} Also I will choose upon their vexations, and I will bring their fears to them; for I called, and none answered; I spake, and they heard not: and they will do evil in mine eyes, and in what I delighted not, they chose.
{66:5} Hear the word of Jehovah, ye trembling at his word: Your brethren hating you, excluding you for sake of my name, said, Jehovah shall be honored: and he was seen to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.
{66:6} A voice of uproar from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Jehovah requiting retribution to his enemies.
{66:7} Bringing forth before she will travail, before pain will come to her, she was delivered of a male.
{66:8} Who heard such as this? who saw such as these things? shall the earth be made to travail in one day? if a nation shall be brought forth at once? for Zion was pained, she also brought forth her sons.
{66:9} Shall I cause to break and not cause to bring forth? will Jehovah say: If I cause to bring forth and did I shut up? said thy God.
{66:10} Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad in her, all ye loving her: rejoice with her from joy, all ye mourning over her:
{66:11} So that ye shall suck and be satisfied from the breast of her consolation; so that ye shall press out and be delighted from the brightness of her glory.
{66:12} For thus said Jehovah, Behold me extending peace to her as a river, and as a torrent flowing to the glory of the nations: and ye sucked, ye shall be lifted upon the side, and ye shall be caressed Upon the knees.
{66:13} As a man whom his mother shall comfort him, so will I comfort you; and in Jerusalem ye shall be comforted.
{66:14} And ye saw, and your heart rejoiced, and your bones shall break forth as the tender grass: and the hand of Jehovah was known with his servants, and his wrath to his enemies.
{66:15} For behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and his chariots as a whirlwind, to turn back in the wrath of his anger, and his rebuke in flames of fire.
{66:16} For with fire and with sword Jehovah judged all flesh: and the wounded of Jehovah were many.
{66:17} They consecrating themselves and cleansing themselves in the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse; together shall they perish, says Jehovah.
{66:18} And I come to gather together all nations and tongues, their works and their purposes; and they came and saw my glory.
{66:19} And I set a sign among them and I sent those escaping of them to the nations, Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, drawing the bow, Tubal and Javan, the isles far off, that heard not my report, and saw not my glory; and they announced my glory among the nations.
{66:20} And they brought all your brethren out of all the nations a gift to Jehovah, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift camels, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, said Jehovah, as the sons of Israel shall bring a gift in a clean vessel to the house of Jehovah.
{66:21} And I also will take from them for priests, for Levites, said Jehovah.
{66:22} For as the new heavens and the new earth which I made, standing before me, says Jehovah, so shall stand your seed and your name.
{66:23} And it was as often as the new moon in its new moon, and as often as the Sabbath in its Sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says Jehovah.
{66:24} And they went forth and saw the carcasses of the men transgressing against me: for their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched; and they were an abhorrence to all flesh.
