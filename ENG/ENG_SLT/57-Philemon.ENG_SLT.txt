{1:1} PAUL, imprisoned of Jesus Christ, Timothy the brother, to Philemon, dearly beloved, and cooperating,
{1:2} And to the dearly beloved Apphia, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the church in thy house:
{1:3} Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
{1:4} I thank my God, always making remembrance of thee in my prayers,
{1:5} Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast to the Lord Jesus, and to all the holy;
{1:6} So that the mutual participation of thy faith might be effective in acknowledgment of every good in you to Christ Jesus.
{1:7} For we have much grace and consolation upon thy love, for the bowels of the holy are refreshed by thee, brother.
{1:8} Wherefore, having much freedom of speech in Christ to enjoin thee what concerns thee,
{1:9} By love I beseech rather, being such as Paul an aged man, and now also the imprisoned of Jesus Christ.
{1:10} I beseech thee for my child whom I begat in my bonds, Onesimus.
{1:11} Once unprofitable to thee, but now more profitable to thee and to me:
{1:12} Whom I sent back: and thou him, that is, my bowels, receive again:
{1:13} Whom I was wishing to retain to myself, that for thee he might serve me in the bonds of the good news:
{1:14} But without thy judgment I would do nothing; that good might not be as according to necessity, but according to free will.
{1:15} For perhaps therefore he was separated for a time, that thou mightest receive him forever;
{1:16} No more as a servant, but above a servant, a dearly beloved brother, especially to me, and how much rather to thee, also in the flesh, and in the Lord?
{1:17} If therefore thou hold me a participator, receive him in addition as me.
{1:18} And if he injured thee any, or is indebted, charge this to me.
{1:19} I Paul wrote with my hand, I will pay back: that I say not to thee, for thou owest thyself to me also in addition.
{1:20} Yea, brother, may I be profited by thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
{1:21} Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote to thee, knowing that thou wilt do above what I say to thee.
{1:22} And at the same time also prepare for me a reception as a guest: for I hope that by your prayers I shall be given as a favor to you.
{1:23} Epaphras greets thee, my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus;
{1:24} Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my co-workers.
{1:25} The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with your spirit. Amen.
