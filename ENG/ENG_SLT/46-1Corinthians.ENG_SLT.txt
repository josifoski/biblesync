{1:1} Paul, called, sent of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,
{1:2} To the church of God being in Corinth, to the consecrated in Christ Jesus, to the Called holy ones, with all calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours:
{1:3} Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
{1:4} I return thanks to my God always for you, for the grace of God given you in Christ Jesus;
{1:5} That in every thing we were enriched in him, in all the word, and all knowledge;
{1:6} As the testimony of Jesus Christ was made firm in you:
{1:7} So that ye are not wanting in any grace; awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
{1:8} Who also shall make you firm even to the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
{1:9} God faithful, by whom we were called to the communion of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
{1:10} And I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same, and there be no divisions in you; and ye be set in order in the same mind and in the same knowledge.
{1:11} For it was manifested to me concerning you, my brethren, by them of Chloe, that there are contentions with you.
{1:12} And this I say, that each of you says, I truly am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
{1:13} Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you? or in Paul's name were ye immersed.
{1:14} I thank God that I immersed none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
{1:15} Lest any should say that in my name I have immersed.
{1:16} And I immersed also the house of Stephanas: besides, I know not if I immersed any other.
{1:17} For Christ sent me not to immerse, but to announce good news: not in wisdom of word, lest the cross of Christ be made void.
{1:18} For truly the word of the cross to them perishing is foolishness; but to us saved it is the power of God.
{1:19} For it has been written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and put away the understanding of the intelligent.
{1:20} Where the wise? where the scribe? where the seekers together of this life has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
{1:21} For since in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, God was contented by the foolishness of proclaiming to save them believing.
{1:22} And since the Jews ask a sign, and the Greeks seek wisdom:
{1:23} And we proclaim Christ crucified, to the Jews truly a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness;
{1:24} And to these the called, to both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and wisdom of God.
{1:25} For the foolish thing of God is wiser than men; and the weak thing of God is stronger than men.
{1:26} For ye see your calling, brethren, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many powerful, not, many well born:
{1:27} But the foolish things of the world, has God chosen that he might shame the wise; and the weak things of the world has God chosen that he might shame things strong;
{1:28} And the ignoble things of the world, and the despised things, has God chosen, and things not being, that the things being he might leave unemployed:
{1:29} That no flesh might boast before him.
{1:30} And ye are of him in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and also justice, and consecration, and holiness:
{1:31} That, as it has been written, Let him boasting, boast in the Lord.
{2:1} And I having come to you, brethren, came not with eminence of word or of wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.
{2:2} For I judged not to know any thing among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
{2:3} And I, in weakness, and in fear, and in much tremor, was with you.
{2:4} And my word and my proclaiming not in persuasible words of man's wisdom, but in manifestation of the Spirit and of power.
{2:5} That your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
{2:6} But we speak wisdom among the perfected: and the wisdom not of this life, nor of the rulers of this life, they being left unemployed:
{2:7} But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, hidden, which God determined beforehand, before the times to our glory:
{2:8} Which none of the rulers of this world knew: for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
{2:9} But as has been written. Which the eye saw not, and the ear heard not, and upon the heart of man it came not up, what things God has prepared for them loving him.
{2:10} And God has revealed to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, and the deep things of God.
{2:11} For who of men knows the things of men except the spirit of man in him? so also the things of God no one knows, except the Spirit of God.
{2:12} And we have not received the spirit of the world, but the spirit from God; that we might know things bestowed upon us as a gift by God.
{2:13} Which also we speak, not in words taught of man's wisdom, but in them taught of the Holy Spirit; examining spiritual things by spiritual.
{2:14} And the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: and he cannot know, for they are spiritually examined.
{2:15} And the spiritual truly examines all things, and he is examined by no one.
{2:16} For who knew the mind of the Lord, who shall instruct him And we have the mind of Christ.
{3:1} And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as spiritual, but as carnal, as babes in Christ.
{3:2} I have given you milk to drink, and not food; for ye were not able, but neither now are ye yet able.
{3:3} For yet are ye carnal: for wherefore envy in you, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?
{3:4} For when a certain one should say, I truly am of Paul; and another, I of Apollos; are ye not carnal?
{3:5} Who then is Paul, and who Apollos, but servants by whom ye believed, and to each as the Lord gave?
{3:6} I have planted, Apollos watered; but God increased.
{3:7} So that neither he planting is anything, neither he watering; but God increasing.
{3:8} And he planting and he watering are one: and each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.
{3:9} For we are workers together with God: the agriculture of God, ye are the building of God.
{3:10} According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise chief-architect, I have laid the foundation, and another builds upon. And let each see how he builds upon.
{3:11} For none is able to lay another foundation above that laid, which is Jesus the Christ.
{3:12} And if any one build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stalks;
{3:13} The work of each shall be manifested: for the day shall manifest, for in fire it is revealed; and the work of each, what sort it is, the fire shall prove.
{3:14} If the work of any shall remain which he built upon, he shall receive a reward.
{3:15} If the work of any one shall be burned, he shall be caused damage: and he shall be saved; and so as by fire.
{3:16} Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and the spirit of God dwells in you?
{3:17} If any one destroy the temple of God, him will God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which ye are.
{3:18} Let none completely deceive himself. If any think to be wise in this life, let him be foolish, that he may he wise.
{3:19} For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it has been written, He seizing the wise in their deceptions.
{3:20} And again, The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.
{3:21} Therefore let none boast in men. For all things are yours;
{3:22} Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or about to be; all are yours;
{3:23} And ye of Christ; and Christ of God.
{4:1} So let a man reckon us, as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
{4:2} And besides it is sought in stewards, that any one be found faithful.
{4:3} And to me it is the least that I be judged by you, or by man's day: but neither do I judge myself.
{4:4} For I know nothing by myself; but in this I have not been justified: and he examining me is the Lord.
{4:5} Therefore judge ye nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who also, will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of hearts: and then shall praise be to each from God.
{4:6} And these things, brethren, I transformed to myself and to Apollos for you; that ye might learn in us not to think above what has been written, lest ye be puffed up one above one against the other.
{4:7} For who distinguishes thee? and what hast thou which thou didst not receive? and if thou also didst receive, why dost thou boast, as not having received?
{4:8} Already were ye satisfied, already were ye rich, without us ye reigned; and I would ye also reigned, that we also might reign together with you.
{4:9} For I think that God has exhibited us the last sent, as exposed to death; for we were a theatre to the world, and to messengers, and to men.
{4:10} We foolish for Christ, and ye wise in Christ; we weak, and ye strong; ye honourable, and we dishonoured.
{4:11} Until this present hour we also hunger, and thirst, and we are naked, and are cuffed, and are unsteady.
{4:12} And we are wearied, working with our own hands: being reviled, we praise; being driven out, we hold up.
{4:13} Being defamed, we entreat: as the filth of the world were we become, the offscouring of all until now.
{4:14} Not shaming you, write I these, but as my beloved children I admonish you.
{4:15} For if ye have ten thousand preceptors in Christ, but not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus by the good news I begat you.
{4:16} I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.
{4:17} Therefore sent I Timotheus to you, who is my beloved child, and faithful in the Lord, who will remind you of all my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in all the churches.
{4:18} And as my not coming to you, some were puffed up.
{4:19} And I will come to you swiftly, if the Lord will, and I shall know not the word of those puffed up, but the power.
{4:20} For the kingdom of God not in word, but in power.
{4:21} What will ye? should I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?
{5:1} In general is fornication heard among you, and such fornication which is not named in the nations, for any to have his father's wife.
{5:2} And ye were puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he having done this work might be taken away from the midst of you.
{5:3} For I truly, as being at a distance in body, and being present in spirit, have already, as being present, judged him having so worked this.
{5:4} In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, ye, gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
{5:5} To deliver such a one to Satan for the ruin of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
{5:6} Your boasting not good. Know ye not that a little leaven may leaven the whole mixture?
{5:7} Therefore cleanse out the old leaven, that ye may be a new mixture, as ye are unleavened. For also our pascha was sacrificed for us, Christ:
{5:8} Therefore let us keep the festival, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of vice and wickedness; but with the unleavened of frankincense and truth.
{5:9} I wrote to you in the epistle not to mix together with fornicators.
{5:10} And not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or the rapacious, or idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.
{5:11} And now I wrote to you not to mix together, if any called a brother is a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or intoxicated, or rapacious; not to eat with such.
{5:12} For what to me also to judge them without? do ye yourselves judge them within.
{5:13} And them without God judges. And take ye away evil from yourselves.
{6:1} Dare any of you, having an affair with another, be judged by the unjust, and not by the holy ones?
{6:2} Know ye not that the holy ones shall judge the world? and if the world be judged by you, are ye unworthy of the least judgments?
{6:3} Know ye not that we shall judge messengers? also not only things pertaining to the cares of life?
{6:4} Therefore truly, if ye have judgments pertaining to the cares of life, set them counted as nothing in the church.
{6:5} For confusion I speak to you. So is there not one wise with you, who will be able to judge between his brother?
{6:6} But brother with brother is judged, and this by the unbelieving.
{6:7} Therefore truly, already is there wholly a misfortune in you, that ye have judgments with yourselves. Wherefore had ye not rather be treated ill? wherefore had ye not rather be defrauded?
{6:8} But ye treat ill, and defraud, and that the brethren.
{6:9} Or know ye not that the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God Be ye not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,
{6:10} Nor thieves; nor covetous, nor intoxicated, nor railers, nor rapacious, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
{6:11} And these were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were consecrated, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.
{6:12} All things are lawful to me, but all are not profitable: all are lawful to me, but I will not be exercised by power under any.
{6:13} Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods: and God will also leave unemployed this and them. And the body not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
{6:14} And God also raised up the Lord, and us will he also raise up by his power.
{6:15} Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? having taken the members of Christ, shall I make members of a harlot? It may not be.
{6:16} Or know ye not that he joined to a harlot is one body? for they shall be, he says, they two into one flesh.
{6:17} And he joined to the Lord is one spirit.
{6:18} Flee fornication. Every sin which if a man do is without the body; but he committing fornication sins against his own body.
{6:19} Or know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit in you, which ye have from God, and ye are not your own?
{6:20} For ye were bought for a price: then glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are of God.
{7:1} And of what ye wrote to me: good for a man not to touch a woman.
{7:2} And, on account of fornication, let each have his own wife, and let each have her own husband.
{7:3} Let the husband return to the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife to the husband.
{7:4} The wife of her own body has not power, but the husband: and likewise also the husband of his own body has not power, but the wife.
{7:5} Deprive ye not one another, except somewhat of an agreement for a time, that ye might have leisure for fasting and prayer; and again upon the same ye might come together, lest Satan tempt you for your want of self command.
{7:6} And this I say according to indulgence, not according to order.
{7:7} For I will all men to be as also myself. But each has his own favor of God, the one truly thus, and the other thus.
{7:8} And I say to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they remain also as I.
{7:9} And if they have not self command, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to be set on fire.
{7:10} And to the married I announce, (not I, but the Lord,) The wife not to be separated from the husband:
{7:11} And if also she be separated, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to the husband: and the husband not to send away the wife.
{7:12} And to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother have an unbelieving wife, and she assents to dwell with him, let him not send her away.
{7:13} And the woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he assents to dwell with her, let her not send him away.
{7:14} For the unbelieving husband was consecrated in the wife, and the unbelieving wife was consecrated in the husband: for then are our children unclean; and now are they holy.
{7:15} And if the unbelieving is separated, let him be separated. A brother or a sister has not been reduced to slavery in such things as these: and God has called us in peace.
{7:16} For what knowest thou, O wife, if thou shalt save the husband or what knowest thou, O husband, if thou shalt save the wife?
{7:17} Except as God divided to each, as the Lord has called each, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the churches.
{7:18} Whoever was called circumcised? let him not be drawn to himself. Whoever was called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
{7:19} Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commands of God.
{7:20} Each in the calling which he was called, in this let him remain.
{7:21} A servant wert thou called? let it not concern thee: for if thou art able to be free, rather make use of it.
{7:22} For the servant called in the Lord, is the freedman of the Lord: likewise also the freedman called, is the servant of Christ.
{7:23} Ye were bought for a price; be ye not servants of men.
{7:24} Each, in what he was called, brethren, in this let him remain with God.
{7:25} But for virgins I have not an order of the Lord: and I give an opinion as compassionated by the Lord to be faithful.
{7:26} I think therefore this to be good for the present necessity, that it is good for a man to be thus.
{7:27} Hast thou been bound to a wife? seek not a release. Hast thou been loosed from a wife seek thou not a wife.
{7:28} And if also thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned. And such shall have pressure to the flesh: and I spare you.
{7:29} And this I say, brethren, the time is restricted; as to the rest, that they also having wives should be as not having;
{7:30} And they weeping, as not weeping; and they rejoicing, as not rejoicing; and they buying, as not possessing.
{7:31} And they using this world, as not using; for the form of this world passes away.
{7:32} But I will you to be free from care. The unmarried cares for things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord:
{7:33} And he married cares for the things of the world, how he shall please the wife.
{7:34} The wife and virgin have been divided. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, that she might be holy also in body and spirit: and she married cares for the things of the world, how she shall please her husband.
{7:35} And this I say for the advantage of yourselves; not that I shall cast a net upon you, but for the becoming, and occupied assiduously for the Lord without being turned away.
{7:36} And if any think to act unbecomingly towards his virgin, if she be past the vigor of youth, and so it ought to be, let him do what he will, he sins not; let them marry.
{7:37} And he who has stood firmly fixed in heart; not having necessity, and has power concerning his own will, and has judged this in his heart to keep his virgin, does well.
{7:38} So that he marrying does well; and he not marrying does better.
{7:39} The woman was bound by law for as much time as her husband lives; and if her husband be set to sleep, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
{7:40} And she is happier if she so remain, according to my opinion: and I also think to have the Spirit of God.
{8:1} And concerning sacrifice to idols, we know, (for we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, and love builds the house.
{8:2} And if any one thinks to know anything, as yet he has known nothing as he ought to know.
{8:3} And if any one love God, the same is known of him.)
{8:4} Concerning food therefore of sacrifices to idols, we know that an idol nothing in the world, and that none other God but one.
{8:5} For also though they are called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon the earth, (for there are many gods, and many lords,)
{8:6} But to us one God, the Father, of whom all things, and we for him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom all things, and we by him.
{8:7} But not in all, knowledge: and some with consciousness of the idol even till now eat as a sacrifice to idols: and their consciousness being weak is contaminated.
{8:8} And food sets us not before God: for neither, if we eat, do we abound; neither if we eat not, do we want.
{8:9} And see ye lest this your power be a stumble to the weak.
{8:10} For if any one see thee having knowledge reclining in the idol's temple, shall not his consciousness, being weak, be built up to eat the sacrifices to idols;
{8:11} And shall the weak brother be destroyed upon thy knowledge, for whom Christ died?
{8:12} And so sinning against the brethren, and striking their weak consciousness, ye sin against Christ.
{8:13} Wherefore, if food offend my brother, I will eat no flesh forever, lest I shall offend my brother.
{9:1} Am I not sent? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are ye not my work in the Lord.
{9:2} If to others I am not sent, but surely I am to you: for the seal of my sending are ye in the Lord.
{9:3} My justification to them examining me is this,
{9:4} have we not power to eat and to drink?
{9:5} Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife; as also the rest of the sent, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
{9:6} Or I only and Barnabas, have we not power not to work?
{9:7} Who makes war at any time at his own charges who plants a vineyard, and eats not of its fruit or who feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?
{9:8} Not according to man do I speak these things: or does not the law also say these things?
{9:9} For in the law of Moses has been written, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox grinding. Is there not care to God for oxen?
{9:10} Or does he say altogether on account of us? For it was written on account of us: that he ploughing ought to plough upon hope; and he grinding upon hope, to participate with his hope.
{9:11} If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it great if we shall reap your carnal things?
{9:12} If others participate with your power, not rather we? But we used not this power; but endure all things, lest we give some hindrance to the good news of Christ.
{9:13} Do ye not know that they working consecrated things, eat of the temple? they working diligently at the altar, share together with the altar?
{9:14} Thus also the Lord appointed to them announcing good news to live of the good news.
{9:15} But I used none of these things: and I wrote not these things, that thus it might be with me: for good to me rather to die, than that any should render my boasting void.
{9:16} For if I announce the good news, there is no boasting to me: for necessity is laid upon me; and woe is to me, if I announce not the good news!
{9:17} For if of free will I do this, I have reward: and if unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a stewardship.
{9:18} What reward therefore is to me? That announcing good news, I shall make the good news of Christ not expensive, not to make use of my power in the good news.
{9:19} For being free from all, I have subjected myself to all, that I might gain the more.
{9:20} And I was to the Jews as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews: to them under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them under the law;
{9:21} To the lawless, as lawless, (not being lawless to God, but subject to the law to Christ,) that I might gain the lawless,
{9:22} I became to the weak as weak, that I might gain the weak: I have been all things to all, that altogether I might save some.
{9:23} And this I do on account of the good news, that I might become a partaker of it.
{9:24} Do ye not know that they running in a race-course, all truly run, and one receives the prize of combat? Do ye so run, that ye might receive.
{9:25} And every one contending for the prize, has self command in all things. These surely therefore that they might receive a corruptible crown; and we an incorruptible.
{9:26} I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so practise I pugilism, as not laying stripes upon air:
{9:27} But I give my body a blow under the eyes, and reduce to bondage: lest having proclaimed to others, I myself be rejected.
{10:1} And I will not ye be ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
{10:2} And were all immersed into Moses in the cloud, and in the sea;
{10:3} And they all ate the same spiritual food.
{10:4} And all drank the same spiritual drink: for they drank of the spiritual Rock following; and the Rock was Christ.
{10:5} But God was not contented with the most of them: for they were overthrown in the desert.
{10:6} And these things were our types, that we be not eagerly desirous of evil things, as they also eagerly desired.
{10:7} Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them; as has been written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
{10:8} Neither should we commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and there fell in one day twenty-three thousand.
{10:9} Neither should we tempt Christ, as also some of them tempted, and were destroyed by serpents.
{10:10} Neither do ye murmur, as also some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.
{10:11} And all those happened types to them; and it was written for our reminding, to whom the ends of the times have arrived.
{10:12} Therefore let him seeming to stand see that he fall not.
{10:13} No temptation except human has taken you and God faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able; but with the temptation will he also make an escape, that ye may be able to bear.
{10:14} Wherefore, my beloved, do ye flee from idolatry.
{10:15} As to the wise speak I; judge ye what I say.
{10:16} The cup of praise which we praise, is it not the mutual participation of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the mutual participation of the body of Christ?
{10:17} That, one bread, one body, we are many: for we all partake of one bread.
{10:18} See ye Israel according to the flesh: are not they eating the sacrifices mutual participators of the altar?
{10:19} What do I say therefore? that an idol is any thing? or that what is sacrificed to an idol is any thing?
{10:20} But, that what things they sacrifice the nations sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I will not ye be partakers of demons.
{10:21} Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and the table of demons.
{10:22} Do we emulate the Lord? are we stronger than he?
{10:23} All things are lawful to me, but all are not profitable: all things are lawful to me, but all build not the house.
{10:24} Let none seek his own, but each another's.
{10:25} Every thing being sold in the market, eat, ye, interrogating nothing through consciousness:
{10:26} For of the Lord the earth, and its fulness.
{10:27} And if any one of the unbelieving call you, and ye wish to go; every thing set before you, eat, interrogating nothing through consciousness.
{10:28} And if any one say to you, This is sacrificed to an idol, eat not, for him making it known, and consciousness: for of the Lord the earth, and its fulness:
{10:29} And consciousness, I say, not thine, but another's: for that why is my freedom judged by another's consciousness.
{10:30} And if I partake by grace, why am I defamed for what I give thanks?
{10:31} Whether therefore ye eat, whether ye drink, or what ye do, do ye all things to the glory of God.
{10:32} And be ye not molesters to the Jews, and the Greeks, and to the church of God:
{10:33} As I also please in all things to all, not seeking my advantage, but that of many, that they might be saved.
{11:1} Be ye imitators of me, as I also of Christ.
{11:2} And I approve you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and as I have delivered to you, do ye hold the traditions.
{11:3} And I will you to know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman the man; and the head of Christ God.
{11:4} Every man praying or prophesying, having on the head, shames his head.
{11:5} And every woman praying or prophesying with head uncovered shames her head: for it is one and the same to her having been shaved.
{11:6} For if the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn: and if shameful to the woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
{11:7} For truly the man ought not to have the head covered, being the image and glory of God: and the woman is the glory of the man.
{11:8} For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
{11:9} For also the man was not created through the woman; but the woman through the man.
{11:10} Therefore the woman ought to have power upon the head for the angels.
{11:11} But neither the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.
{11:12} For as the woman by the man, so also the man by the woman; and all things of God.
{11:13} Judge in yourselves: is it suitable for a woman to pray to God uncovered?
{11:14} Does not nature itself teach you, that, if a man truly have long hair, it is a dishonour to him?
{11:15} And if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for the hair has been given her for a cloak.
{11:16} And if any one seem to be loving strife, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
{11:17} And this announcing I approve not, that not for the better come ye together, but for the worse.
{11:18} For truly first, ye coming together in the church, I hear divisions to be among you; and some part I believe.
{11:19} For there must be also sects among you, that the tried might be made manifest among you.
{11:20} Therefore ye coming together upon the same, it is not to eat the Lord's supper.
{11:21} For each takes his own supper in eating: and one is truly hungry, and one is intoxicated.
{11:22} For, have ye not houses for eating and drinking? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them not having? What should I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise not.
{11:23} For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus, in the night which he was delivered up, took bread:
{11:24} And having given thanks, he brake, and said, Take ye, eat; this is my body, broken for you: this do ye for my remembrance.
{11:25} Likewise the cup also, after supping, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do ye, as often as ye drink, for my remembrance.
{11:26} For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye announce the Lord's death till he come.
{11:27} Therefore whoever should eat this bread, and drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be liable to the penalty of the body and blood of the Lord.
{11:28} And let a man try himself, and so eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.
{11:29} For he eating and drinking unworthily, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
{11:30} For this many among you weak and sick, and enough are asleep.
{11:31} For if we examined ourselves, we should not be judged.
{11:32} And being judged, we are corrected of the Lord, lest we be condemned with the world.
{11:33} Therefore, my brethren, coming together to eat, succeed one another.
{11:34} And if any hunger, let him eat in the house; lest ye come together for judgment. And the rest when I come I will regulate.
{12:1} And concerning spiritual things, brethren, I wish you not to be ignorant.
{12:2} Ye know that ye were the nations, to dumb idols, as ye were led, being carried away.
{12:3} Wherefore I make known to you, that none speaking in the Spirit of God calls Jesus anathema: and none can say Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Spirit.
{12:4} And there are distinctions of favors, and the same Spirit.
{12:5} And there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord.
{12:6} And there are distinctions of performances, and it is the same God performing all things in all.
{12:7} And to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit.
{12:8} For truly to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
{12:9} And to another faith in the same Spirit; and to another graces of healings in the same Spirit;
{12:10} And to another performances of powers; and to another discriminations of spirits; and to another kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues:
{12:11} And all these works one and the same Spirit, dividing to each his own things as be will.
{12:12} For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the one body, being many, is one body: so also is Christ.
{12:13} For also in one Spirit were we all immersed into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether servants or free; and we have all been given to drink into one Spirit.
{12:14} For also the body is not one member, but many.
{12:15} If the foot say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; by this is it not of the body.
{12:16} And if the ear say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; by this is it not of the body.
{12:17} If the whole body an eye, where the hearing If the whole hearing, where the smelling?
{12:18} And now has God set the members each one of them in the body, as he would.
{12:19} And if all were one member, where the body.
{12:20} And now truly many members, and one body.
{12:21} The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
{12:22} But much rather the members of the body, seeming to be weak, are necessary:
{12:23} And what we think to be less honourable of the body, upon these we put more abundant honour; and our unseemly parts have more abundant decorum.
{12:24} And our becoming parts have no need: but God blended the body together, to the wanting having given more abundant honour:
{12:25} That no division be in the body; but the members should care the same for one another.
{12:26} And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer together; or one member is honoured, all the members rejoice together.
{12:27} And ye are the body of Christ, and members by parts.
{12:28} And whom truly God set in the church, first the sent, second the prophets, third teachers, then powers, then graces of healings, helps, directions, kinds of tongues.
{12:29} Not all sent: not all prophets: not all teachers: not all powers:
{12:30} All have not the favors of healing: not all speaking with tongues: not all interpret accurately.
{12:31} And be emulous of the better favors: and yet I shew you a way according to eminence.
{13:1} If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I have been the brass of echoes, and the shouting cymbal.
{13:2} And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries, and all knowledge; and if I have all faith to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing.
{13:3} And if I feed out all my goods, and if I deliver my body that I be burned, and have not love, I am profited nothing.
{13:4} Love is slow to anger, possesses kindness; love envies not; love vaunts not itself, is not puffed up,
{13:5} It demeans itself not unbecomingly, seeks not the things of itself, is not irritated, reckons no evil;
{13:6} Rejoices not at injustice, and rejoices with the truth;
{13:7} Covers all things, believes all, hopes all things, endures all.
{13:8} Love never falters: but whether gifts of prophecies, they shall be left unemployed; whether tongues, they shall cease; whether knowledge, it shall be left unemployed.
{13:9} For we know by parts, and we prophesy by parts.
{13:10} And when the perfected come, then shall that by parts be left unemployed.
{13:11} When I was a child, as a child I spake, as a child I thought, as a child I reckoned: and when I had become a man, I left unemployed the things of a child.
{13:12} For now we see by a mirror in an enigma; then face to face: now I know by parts; and then shall I know as I was known.
{13:13} And now remains faith, hope, love, these three; and the greater of these, love.
{14:1} Pursue love, and be emulous of spiritual things, and rather that ye might prophesy.
{14:2} For he speaking in a tongue speaks not to men, but to God: (for none hears; and in the spirit he speaks mysteries.)
{14:3} And he prophesying speaks to men for building the house, and entreaty, and encouragement.
{14:4} And he speaking in a tongue builds himself; and he prophesying builds the church.
{14:5} And I will ye all to speak with tongues, and rather that ye prophesy; for greater he prophesying, than he speaking with tongues, unless he interpret accurately, that the church receive building up.
{14:6} And now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?
{14:7} As inanimate things giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if it give not a distinction to sounds, how shall the piping or harping be known?
{14:8} For also if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war?
{14:9} So also ye, except by the tongue ye give an evident word, how shall the speaking be known? for ye shall be speaking into the air.
{14:10} If perchance, such kind of voices be in the world, and none of them speechless.
{14:11} If therefore I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him speaking a foreigner, and he speaking a foreigner to me.
{14:12} So also ye, since ye are zealous of spirits, for the building up of the church seek that ye may abound.
{14:13} Wherefore he speaking in a tongue, let, him pray that he might interpret.
{14:14} For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, and my mind is unfruitful.
{14:15} What therefore is it? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray also with the mind: I will play on the harp in the spirit, and I will play also on the harp in the mind.
{14:16} When if thou praise in the spirit, how shall he filling the place of the private individual say Amen at thy thanksgiving) since he knows not what thou sayest.
{14:17} For thou truly givest thanks well, but the other is not built up.
{14:18} I thank my God, speaking in tongues more than you all:
{14:19} But in the church, I will to speak five words by my mind, that I might also sound in the ears of others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
{14:20} Brethren, be not children in reflection: but in wickedness act like children, and in reflection be ye perfected.
{14:21} It has been written in the law, That in other tongues and in other lips will I speak to this people; and not so will they hear me, says the Lord.
{14:22} So that tongues are for a sign, not to the believing, but to the unbelieving: and the gift of prophecy, not to the unbelieving, but to the believing.
{14:23} If therefore the whole church come together upon the same, and all speak with tongues, and the private individual, or unbelieving, come in, will they not say that ye are enraged?
{14:24} And If all prophesy, and any unbelieving, or ignorant private individual come in, he is refuted by all, he is examined by all:
{14:25} And so the hidden things of his heart are made manifest; and so having fallen upon the face, he will worship God, proclaiming that God is truly with you.
{14:26} Therefore, what is it brethren when ye come together, every one of you has a Psalms, has teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretatior. Let all things be for the building of the house.
{14:27} Whether any speak in a tongue, by two, or the most by three, and in part; and let one interpret.
{14:28} And if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
{14:29} And let the prophets speak two or three, and let others decide.
{14:30} And if to another sitting by it be revealed, let the first be silent.
{14:31} For ye are all able to prophesy one by one, that all might learn, and all might be encouraged.
{14:32} And the spirits of the prophets are subjected to the prophets.
{14:33} For God is not of unsteadiness, but of peace, as in all the churches of the holy ones.
{14:34} Let your women be silent in the churches: for it has not been committed to them to speak; but to be subjected, as also says the law.
{14:35} And if they will learn anything, let them ask their own husbands in the house; for it is shameful for women to speak in the church.
{14:36} Or came out the word of God from you or did it arrive to you only?
{14:37} If any think to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him observe what I write to you, that they are the commands of the Lord.
{14:38} And if any is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
{14:39} Therefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy, and hinder not to speak in tongues.
{14:40} Let all things be becomingly and according to order.
{15:1} And I make known to you, brethren, the good news which I announced to you, which also ye received, and in which ye stood;
{15:2} By which also ye are saved, to which word I announced to you if ye hold, unless ye believed to no purpose.
{15:3} For I delivered to you among the first, what I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the writings;
{15:4} And that he was buried, and that he was raised the third day, according to the writings.
{15:5} And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve:
{15:6} Then was he seen by above five hundred brethren once for all; of whom the most remain till now, and some also are laid to rest.
{15:7} Then was he seen by James; then by all the sent.
{15:8} And last of all exactly as an abortive, was he also seen by me.
{15:9} For I am the least of the sent, who am not fit to be called sent, for I drove out the church of God.
{15:10} And by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which in me was not vain; but I was more abundantly wearied than they all: and not I, but the grace of God which with me.
{15:11} Whether therefore I or they, so we proclaim, and so ye believed.
{15:12} And if Christ is proclaimed that he arose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no rising up of the dead?
{15:13} And if there is no rising up of the dead, neither has Christ risen:
{15:14} And if Christ has not risen, then our proclaiming vain, and also your faith vain.
{15:15} And we are also found false witnesses of God; for we testified for God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not, if therefore the dead are not raised.
{15:16} For if the dead are not raised, neither was Christ raised up:
{15:17} And if Christ was not raised up, your faith is vain; yet are ye in your sins.
{15:18} Then they also having died in Christ perished.
{15:19} If in this life only we have been hoping in Christ, we are more to be compassionated than all men.
{15:20} And now Was Christ raised from the dead, he was the first fruits of those having died.
{15:21} For since by man death, also by man the rising up of the dead.
{15:22} For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
{15:23} And each in his own order: the first fruit Christ; then they of Christ in his arrival.
{15:24} Then the end, when he should deliver up the kingdom to God, and the Father; when he should leave unemployed every beginning and every authority and power.
{15:25} For he must reign, till he put all enemies under his feet.
{15:26} The last enemy, death, is left unemployed.
{15:27} For he subjected all things under his feet. And when he said that all things have been subjected, it is manifest that without him having subjected all things to him.
{15:28} And when all things be subjected to him, then also shall the Son himself be subjected to him having made all things subject to him, that God might be all things in all.
{15:29} For what shall they do being immersed for the dead, if in fine the dead rise not? and why are they immersed for the dead?
{15:30} And why are we in peril every hour?
{15:31} In the day I die by: your boasting which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.
{15:32} If according to man I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what the profit to me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.
{15:33} Be not deceived: evil intercourses corrupt good habits.
{15:34} Recover your senses rightly, and in not; for some have a want of knowledge of God: I speak to your confusion.
{15:35} But some one will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
{15:36} Froth, what thou sowest is not made alive, except it die:
{15:37} And what thou sowest, thou sowest not the body going to be, but the naked kernel, if perhaps of wheat, or some of the rest:
{15:38} And God gives it a body as he would, and to each of the seed its own body.
{15:39} Not all flesh the same flesh: but one truly flesh of men, and another of cattle, and another of fishes, and another of flying things.
{15:40} And celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies: but truly one the glory of the celestial, and another that of the terrestrial.
{15:41} One glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for star differs from star in glory.
{15:42} So also the rising up of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
{15:43} It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
{15:44} It is sown an animated body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is an animated body, and there is a spiritual body.
{15:45} So also has been written, The first man Adam was born into a living soul; and the last Adam into a spirit making alive.
{15:46} But the first not spiritual, but animated; then the spiritual.
{15:47} The first man of earth, made of earth: the second man the Lord from heaven.
{15:48} As the made of earth, such also the made of earth: and as the celestial, such also the celestial.
{15:49} And as we have borne the image of the made of earth, we shall also bear the image of the celestial.
{15:50} And this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.
{15:51} Behold, I speak to you a mystery; We truly shall not all be laid asleep, but we shall all be changed,
{15:52} In an atom, in the twinkling of the eye, in the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
{15:53} For this corrupted must put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality.
{15:54} And when this corrupted shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality, then shall be the word written, Death was swallowed down in victory.
{15:55} Where thine, death, the sting? where thine, hades, the victory.
{15:56} And the sting of death sin; and the power of sin the law.
{15:57} And grace to God, giving us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ.
{15:58} Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be stable, unmoved, abounding in the work of the Lord always, knowing that our fatigue is not in vain in the Lord.
{16:1} And concerning the collection for the holy ones, as I appointed to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.
{16:2} According to one day of the sabbaths let each of you put by himself, treasuring up that which he is prospered in, that when I come there be no collections.
{16:3} And when I be present, whom ye approve by letters, these will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.
{16:4} And if it be suitable for me also to go, they shall go with me.
{16:5} And I will come to you, when I pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.
{16:6} And perhaps with you I shall abide, or also pass the winter, that ye might send me forward wherever I go.
{16:7} For I will not see you now in coming forward; but I hope to remain some time with you, if the Lord permit.
{16:8} And I will remain in Ephesus even till Pentecost.
{16:9} For a door has stood open to me, great and effective, and many opposed.
{16:10} And if Timotheus come, see ye that he be with you fearlessly: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also.
{16:11} Therefore no one should despise him: and send ye him forward in peace, that he might come to me: for I expect him with the brethren.
{16:12} And concerning Apollos, the brother, I besought him much that he would come to you with the brethren: and the will was not altogether that he should come now; and he will come when he should have leisure.
{16:13} Watch ye, stand in the faith, be manly, be strengthened.
{16:14} Let all things be in love.
{16:15} And I beseech you brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and they arranged themselves for service to the holy ones,)
{16:16} That also ye be subjected to such, and to every one cooperating, and to the wearied.
{16:17} And I rejoice at the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and: that they have filled up your necessity.
{16:18} For they refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore observe ye such.
{16:19} The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla, with the church at their house, greet you.
{16:20} All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with a holy kiss.
{16:21} The greeting of Paul by my hand.
{16:22} If any love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.
{16:23} The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ with you:
{16:24} My love with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
