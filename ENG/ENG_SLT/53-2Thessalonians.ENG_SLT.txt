{1:1} Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
{1:2} Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
{1:3} We ought to return thanks to God always for you, brethren, as is fitting, for your faith increases exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all enlarges to one another;
{1:4} So that we ourselves boast in you in all the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your expulsions and pressures which ye endure:
{1:5} (A proof of the just judgment of God,) for you to be deemed worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
{1:6} Even though just with God to return pressure to them pressing you;
{1:7} And to you being pressed a release with us, in the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power,
{1:8} In fire of flame giving vengeance to them not knowing God, and to them not listening to the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ:
{1:9} Who shall undergo punishment, eternal ruin from the face of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;
{1:10} When he should come to be honoured in his holy ones, and to be admired in all the believing, (that our testimony among you was believed) in that day.
{1:11} For which also we pray always for you, that our God would deem you worthy of the calling, and fill all the benevolence of goodness, and work of faith in power:
{1:12} So that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ be honoured in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
{2:1} And we ask you, brethren, concerning the arrival of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our assembling together to him,
{2:2} For you not to be quickly shaken in mind, neither be disturbed, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by epistle as by us, as that the day of Christ has drawn near.
{2:3} Let none deceive you in any manner: for, except an apostasy come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
{2:4} Who being opposed and lifted up above all called God, or which is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.
{2:5} Remember ye not, that, yet being with you, I spake these to you.
{2:6} And now ye know the withholding for him to be revealed in his time.
{2:7} For the mystery of iniquity is already energetic: only he withholding, even till he be out of the midst.
{2:8} And then shall the Lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord will destroy with the spirit of his mouth, and leave unemployed in the splendor of his arrival:
{2:9} Whose arrival is according to the energy of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood,
{2:10} And in all deceit of iniquity in the lost; because they received not the love of the truth, for them to be saved.
{2:11} And for this, God shall send them the energy of error, for them to believe in falsehood:
{2:12} That all might be judged not believing the truth but contented in iniquity.
{2:13} And we ought to return thanks to God always for you, brethren dearly beloved by the Lord, that God chose you from the beginning to salvation in consecration of the Spirit and belief of the truth:
{2:14} To which he called you by our good news, to the acquisition of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
{2:15} Therefore, brethren, stand, and hold firmly the doctrines which ye were taught, whether by the word, or by our epistle.
{2:16} And our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, also our Father, having loved us, and given us eternal consolation and good hope in grace,
{2:17} Comfort your hearts, and support you in every good word and work.
{3:1} As to the rest, pray, brethren, for us, that the word of the Lord may run, and be honoured, as also with you:
{3:2} And that we may be delivered from unfit and evil men: for not faith of all.
{3:3} But the Lord is faithful, who supports you, and will watch from the evil.
{3:4} And we have had confidence in the Lord for you, that what we announce to you, and ye do and will do.
{3:5} And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
{3:6} And we proclaim to you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you to shrink from every brother walking disorderly, and not according to the doctrine which he received of us.
{3:7} For ye yourselves know that ye ought to imitate us: for we were not disorderly among you;
{3:8} Neither ate we the bread of any as a gift; but in fatigue and toil working night and day also, not to overload any of you:
{3:9} Not that we have not power, but that we give ourselves a type to you to imitate us.
{3:10} For also when we were with you, this we proclaimed to you, that if any will not work, neither should he eat.
{3:11} For we hear some walking disorderly among you, working nothing, but occupied unprofitably.
{3:12} And to such we proclaim and beseech by our Lord Jesus Christ, that, with freedom from care working, they should eat their own bread.
{3:13} And ye, brethren, lose not courage doing good.
{3:14} And if any listen not to our word by the epistle, mark him, and mix not together with him, that he may change.
{3:15} And deem not as an enemy, but remind as a brother.
{3:16} And the Lord of peace himself give to you peace for all in every manner. The Lord with you all.
{3:17} The greeting of Paul with my hand, which is the sign in every epistle: so I write.
{3:18} The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen.
