{1:1} The words of Nehemiah son of Hachaliah. And it will be in the month Chisleu, the twentieth year, and I was in Shushan the fortress;
{1:2} And Hanani one of my brethren will come, he and men from Judah; and I shall ask them concerning the Jews of the escaping which were left from the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
{1:3} And they will say to me, They being left which were left of the captivity there in the province, in great evil and in reproach: and the walls of Jerusalem being broken down, and its gates were burnt with fire.
{1:4} And it will be in my hearing these words, I sat down, and I shall weep and mourn days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of the heavens,
{1:5} And saying, Now O Jehovah, God of the heavens, the great and terrible God watching the covenant and mercy to those loving him, and to those watching his commands:
{1:6} Will now thine ear be attentive and thine eye opened to hear to the prayer of thy servant which I pray before thee this day, day and night, for the sons of Israel thy servants, and confess for the sins of the sons of Israel which we sinned against thee? and and the house of my father sinned.
{1:7} Being perverse, we were perverse against thee, and we watched not the commands and the laws and the judgments which thou didst command Moses thy servant.
{1:8} Remember now the word that thou didst command Moses thy servant, saying, Ye will transgress; I will scatter you among the nations:
{1:9} And did ye turn back to me and watch my commands and do them; if there shall be a thrusting forth of you into the extremity of the heavens, from thence will I gather them and bring them to the place which I chose for my name to dwell there.
{1:10} And these thy servants and thy people whom thou didst redeem in thy great power and by thy strong hand.
{1:11} Now, O Lord, now will thine ear be attending to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, desiring to fear thy name? and prosper now to thy servant this day: and wilt thou give him for compassion before this man? And I was giving drink to the king.
{2:1} And it will be in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year to Arthasatha the king, wine before him: and I shall lift up the wine and give to the king. And I was not sad before him.
{2:2} And the king will say to me, Wherefore thy face sad, and thou not being, sick? This nothing but sadness of heart. And I shall be very greatly afraid.
{2:3} And saying to the king, O king, thou wilt live forever: wherefore shall not my face be sad when the city of the house of my father's sepulchres was laid waste, and its gates consumed with fire?
{2:4} And the king will say to me, For what this thou seekest? And I shall pray to the God of the heavens.
{2:5} And saying to the king, If good to the king, and if thy servant shall be good before thee, that thou wilt send me to Judah to the city of my fathers' sepulchres, and I will build it,
{2:6} And the king will say to me (the consort will sit near him) How long shall be thy journey? and when wilt thou turn back? And it will be good before the king, and he will send me; and I shall give to him a time.
{2:7} And saying to the king, If good to the king letters shall be given to me to the prefects beyond the river, that they shall cause me to pass over till I shall come to Judah.
{2:8} And a letter to Asaph watching the pleasure-grounds to the king, who shall give to me woods to frame the gates of the fortress that is to the house, and for the walls of the city, and for the house which I shall come into it And the king will give to me according to the good hand of my God upon me.
{2:9} And I shall come to the prefects beyond the river, and I shall give to them the letter of the king. And the king will send with me chiefs of strength and horsemen.
{2:10} And Sanballat the Horonite will hear, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and it will be evil to them a great evil that a man came to seek good for the sons of Israel.
{2:11} And I shall come to Jerusalem, and I shall be there three days.
{2:12} And I shall rise in the night, I and a few men with me; and I announced not to man what my God gave into my heart to do at Jerusalem: and no beast with me but the beast that I rode upon it.
{2:13} And I shall go forth by the gate of the valley by night, and before the second fountain, and to the gate of the dung-hill, and I shall be watching the walls of Jerusalem that they being broken, and its gates were consumed with fire.
{2:14} And I shall pass over to the gate of the fountain and pool of the king: and not a place for the beast under me to pass.
{2:15} And I shall be going up by the torrent in the night, and I shall be watching the walls, and I shall turn back and come into the gate of the valley; and I shall turn back.
{2:16} And the prefects knew not whither I went and what I was doing: and to the Jews and to the priests and to the nobles and to the prefects, and to the rest doing the work, even thus I announced not.
{2:17} And saying to them, Ye seeing the evil which we are in it, how Jerusalem lay waste, and her gates were burnt with fire: come ye, and we will build the walls of Jerusalem, and we shall be no more a reproach.
{2:18} And I shall announce to them the hand of my God that it was good upon me; and also the king's words who said to me. And they will say, We will rise up and build. And they will strengthen their hands for good.
{2:19} And Sanballat the Horonite will hear, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, and they will mock to us and despise us, and say, What this word that ye do? are ye bearing rule against the king?
{2:20} And I shall turn back word to them, and say to them, The God of the heavens, he will prosper for us; and we his servants will rise up and build: and to you no portion and right and remembrance in Jerusalem.

{4:5} And thou wilt not cover over their iniquity, and their sin shall not be wiped away before thee: for they provoked before the builders.
{4:6} And we shall build the wall; and all the wall will be completed even to its half: and a heart will be to the people to work.
{4:7} And it will be that when Sanballat heard, and Tobiah, and the Arabians and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, that healing ascended to the walls of Jerusalem, that the breaches began to be stopped, and it kindled to them greatly;
{4:8} And they will conspire all of them together to come to war against Jerusalem, and to do damage to it.
{4:9} And we will pray to our God, and we shall set up a watch against them day and night, from before them.
{4:10} And Judah will say, The strength of the bearer was weak, and the dust much; and we shall not be able to build upon the wall.
{4:11} And our adversaries will say, They shall not know, and they shall not see, till that we shall come to their midst and kill them, and cause the work to cease.
{4:12} And it will be that when the Jews dwelling near them came, and they will say to us ten times, From all places which ye shall turn back to us.
{4:13} And I shall set from underneath to the place from behind to the wall upon the dry places, and I shall set the people to the families with their swords, their spears and their bows.
{4:14} And I shall see, and I shall rise up and say to the nobles and to the prefects and to the rest of the people, Ye shall not be afraid from their face: remember Jehovah great and terrible; and war for yourselves, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your houses.
{4:15} And it will be that when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God will disperse their counsel, and we shall turn back all of us to the wall, each to his work.
{4:16} And it will be from that day the half of my young men doing in the work, and half of them holding fast and the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the chiefs behind every house of Judah.
{4:17} They building upon the wall, and they bearing in the burden, they loading with one of his hands doing in the work, and one holding fast the weapon.
{4:18} And the builders, a man his sword being girded upon his loins, and building. And he striking upon the trumpet near me.
{4:19} And saying to the nobles and to the prefects and to the rest of the people, The work much and broad, and we being scattered upon the wall, far off a man from his brother.
{4:20} In the place which ye shall hear the voice of the trumpet there ye shall gather together to us; our God shall war for us.
{4:21} And we doing in the work: and half of them holding fast upon the spears from the ascending of the dawn even till the coming forth of the stars.
{4:22} Also in that time I said to the people, A man and his youth shall lodge in the midst of Jerusalem; and they were watching for us in the night, and work in the day.
{4:23} And not I and my brethren and my young men, and the men of the watch which were after me, we not putting off our garments; a man his weapon for water.
{5:1} And a cry of the people and their wives will be great against their brethren the Jews.
{5:2} And there is which saying, Our sons and our daughters, we being many: and we will take grain and we will eat and live.
{5:3} And there are those saying, Our fields and our vineyards and our houses we pledge, and we will take grain in the famine.
{5:4} And there are those saying, We borrowed silver for the king's tribute, our fields and our vineyards.
{5:5} And now according to the flesh of our brethren, our flesh; as their sons, our sons: and behold, we subdue our sons and our daughters for servants, and there is from our daughters being subdued: and not to the strength of our hand and our fields and our vineyards to others.
{5:6} And it will kindle to me greatly as I heard their cry and these words.
{5:7} And my heart will take counsel to me, and I shall contend with the nobles and the prefects, and say to them, Ye impose a debt each upon his brother. And I shall give a great convocation against them.
{5:8} And saying to them, We bought off our brethren the Jews, being sold to the nations; according to the sufficiency in us and also will ye sell your brethren? and were they sold to us? And they will be silent, and they found not a word.
{5:9} And it will be said, Not good the word which ye do: will ye not go in the fear of our God from the reproach of the nations our enemies?
{5:10} And also I, my brethren and my young men exacting upon them silver and grain: we will leave off now this debt.
{5:11} Turn back now to them according to this day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive trees, and their houses, and the hundredth of the silver and the grain, the new wine and the new oil which ye impose upon them.
{5:12} And they will say, We will turn back, and we will not seek from them; thus will we do as thou sayest And I shall call the priests and shall cause them to swear to do according to this word.
{5:13} Also I shook out my arm, and said, Thus God will shake out every man who will not raise up this word from his house and from his labor; so shall he be shaken out and emptied. And all the convocation will say, Amen, and praise Jehovah. And the people did according to this word.
{5:14} Also from the day which it was commanded me to be their prefect in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year and even to the thirty and second year to Arthasatha the king, twelve years I and my brethren ate not the bread of the prefect.
{5:15} And the former prefects that were before me made heavy upon the people, and they will take from them in bread and wine, the last silver forty shekels; also their young men ruled over the people: and I did not thus from the face of the fear of God.
{5:16} And also I held fast upon the work of this wall, and we bought not a field: and all my young men being gathered there for the work.
{5:17} And the Jews and prefects a hundred and fifty men, and they coming to us from the nations that were round about us; to my table.
{5:18} And what was done for one day, one ox, six choice sheep; and birds were done for me, and within ten days with every wine for abundance: and with this, the bread of the prefect I sought not for the servitude was heavy upon this people.
{5:19} Remember to me, my God, for good, all that I did for this people.
{6:1} And it will be as it was heard by Sanballat and Tobiah, and by Geshem the Arabian, and by the rest of our enemies, that I built the wall and a breach was not left in it; also even to this time I set not up the doors in the gates;
{6:2} And Sanballat sent to me and Geshem, saying, Come, and we will pass over together in the villages in the valley of Ono. And they reckoned to do evil to me.
{6:3} And I shall send messengers to them, saying, I do a great work, and I shall not be able to come down: wherefore shall the work cease when I shall desist and come down to you?
{6:4} And they will send to me according to this word four times; and I shall turn them back according to this word.
{6:5} And Sanballat will send his young man to me according to this word the fifth time, and a letter opened in his hand;
{6:6} Being written in it, It was heard in the nations, and Geshem said, Thou and the Jews are reckoning to rebel: for this thou buildest the wall, and thou to be to them for king according to these words.
{6:7} And also thou didst set up prophets to call upon thee in Jerusalem, saying, A king in Judah: and now it will be heard by the king according to these words: and now come and we will counsel together.
{6:8} And I shall send to him saying, It was not according to these words which thou sayest, for from thy heart thou feignest them.
{6:9} For all of them causing us to be afraid, saying, their hands shall be slackened from the work, and it shall not be done. And now strengthen my hand.
{6:10} And I came to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabeel, and he was shut up; and he will say, We will pass over to the house of God into the midst of the temple, and we will shut the doors of the temple: for they are coming to kill thee; and by night coming to kill thee.
{6:11} And saying, Shall a man like me flee? and who as I that shall go into the temple and live? I will not go in.
{6:12} And I shall know, and behold, not God sent him; for he spake the prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat hired him.
{6:13} So that he was hired that I shall be afraid and do thus, and sin, and it was to them for an evil name, so that they shall reproach me.
{6:14} Remember, O my God, to Tobiah and to Sanballat, according to these his works, and also to Noadiah the prophetess, and to the rest of the prophets who were causing me to fear.
{6:15} And the wall will be completed in the twenty and fifth to Elul, to fifty and two days.
{6:16} And it will be as all our enemies heard, and all the nations that were round about us saw, and they will fall greatly in their own eyes: and they knew that from God was done this work.
{6:17} Also in these days the nobles of Judah were multiplying their letters going to Tobiah, and those to Tobiah came to them.
{6:18} For many in Judah being married by oath to him for he was son-in-law to Shechaniah son of Arah; and Johanan his son took the daughter of Meshullam, son of Berechiah.
{6:19} Also his good things were said before me, and my words were brought forth to him. Tobiah sent letters to cause me to fear.
{7:1} And it will be as the wall was built, and I shall set up the doors, and the gate-keepers, and those singing, and the Levites will be appointed.
{7:2} And I shall command Hanani my brother, and Hananiah chief of the fortress, over Jerusalem, for he is as a man of truth, and fearing God above many.
{7:3} And it will be said to them, The gates of Jerusalem shall not be opened till the sun being hot; and till they standing by shall shut the doors and fasten: and setting up watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, a man in his watch, and a man before his house.
{7:4} And the city broad of hands, and great and the people few in its midst, and the houses not built.
{7:5} And my God will give to my heart, and I shall gather together the nobles and the prefects and the people, to be enrolled: and I shall find the writing of the register of those coming up among the first, and I shall find written as it.

{8:6} And Ezra will praise Jehovah the great God: and all the people will answer, Amen, Amen, in lifting up their hands: and they will bow down and worship to Jehovah, with faces to the earth.
{8:7} And Joshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, causing the people to understand to the law: and the people upon their standing.
{8:8} And they will read in the book in the law of God accurately, and he set up the understanding, and they will cause to understand the reading.
{8:9} And Nehemiah, (he the Tirshatha) will say, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites causing the people to understand, To all the people this day is holy to Jehovah your God; ye shall not mourn, and ye shall not weep. For all the people weeping in their hearing to the words of the law.
{8:10} And he will say to them, Go ye; eat fatnesses, and drink sweetnesses, and send portions to him for whom nothing was prepared: for the day is holy to our Lord: and ye shall not grieve, for the joy of Jehovah this is your strength.
{8:11} And the Levites silencing to all the people, saying, Silence; for the day is holy; and ye shall not grieve.
{8:12} And all the people will go to eat and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great gladness, for they understood the words that were made known to them.
{8:13} And in the second day were gathered together the heads of the fathers to all the people, the priests, the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, and to understand to the words of the law.
{8:14} And they will find written in the law which Jehovah commanded by the hand of Moses, that the sons of Israel dwelt in booths in the festival in the seventh month.
{8:15} And that they will cause to hear and will cause a voice to pass over in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go ye forth to the mountain and bring leaves of olive, and leaves of the tree of oil, and leaves of myrtle, and leaves of palms, and leaves of the tree interwoven, to make booths according to the writing.
{8:16} And the people will go forth, and will bring and make for themselves booths, each upon his roof, and in their enclosures, and in the enclosures of the house of God, and in the broad place of the gate of the waters and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim.
{8:17} And all the convocation of those turning back from the captivity will make booths, and they will dwell in booths; for from the days of Joshua son of Nun, the sons of Israel did not thus even to this day. And there will be great gladness exceedingly.
{8:18} And he will read in the book of the law of God day by day, from the first day even to the last day. And they will do a festival seven days; and in the eighth day a restraint according to judgment.
{9:1} And in the twenty and fourth day to this month, the sons of Israel were gathered together with fasting and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.
{9:2} And the seed of Israel will be separated from all the sons of the stranger, and they will stand and confess over their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
{9:3} And they will rise up upon their standing and read in the book of the law of Jehovah their God, the fourth of the day; and a fourth confessing and worshiping to Jehovah their God.
{9:4} And there will rise up upon the ascent of the Levites, Joshua and the sons of Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bani, Sherebiah, Bani, Chenani; and they will cry with a great voice to Jehovah their God.
{9:5} And the Levites, Joshua and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, Pethahiah, will say, Rise up, praise Jehovah your God from forever even to forever: and they shall praise the name of thy glory, exalting over all blessing and praise.
{9:6} Thou thyself, O Jehovah, thou alone, didst make the heavens, the heavens of heavens, with all their army, the earth and all that is upon it, the seas and all that is in them, and thou makest alive all of them: and the army of the heavens worshiping to thee.
{9:7} Thou thyself Jehovah the God who chose in Abram, and thou broughtest him from Ur of the Chaldees, and didst set his name Abraham.
{9:8} And thou didst find his heart faithful before thee, and thou didst cut out a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perezzites, the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give to his seed: and thou wilt set up thy words, for thou art just:
{9:9} And thou wilt see the humbling of our fathers in Egypt, and thou heardest their cry upon the sea of sedge:
{9:10} And thou wilt give signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants, and upon all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they acted proudly against them. And thou wilt make to thee a name as this day.
{9:11} And thou didst cleave asunder the sea before them, and they will pass over in the midst of the sea upon dry land; and those pursuing them thou didst cast into the depths as a stone into the strong waters.
{9:12} And in a pillar of cloud thou didst guide them by day, and in a pillar of fire by night, to enlighten the way to them that they shall go in it.
{9:13} And upon mount Sinai thou camest down, and speaking with them from the heavens, and thou wilt give to them right judgments, and laws of truth, good laws and commands.
{9:14} And thou didst make known to them thy holy Sabbath, and commands, and ordinances, and law; thou didst charge to them by the hand of Moses thy servant:
{9:15} And bread from the heavens thou gavest to them for their hunger, and water from the rock thou broughtest forth to them for their thirst; and thou wilt say to them to go in and to inherit the land which thou didst lift up thy hand to give to them.
{9:16} And they and our fathers acted proudly, and they will harden their neck, and will not hear to thy commands,
{9:17} And they will refuse to hear, and they will not remember thy wonders which thou didst with them; and they will harden their necks, and they will give a head to turn back to their servitude in their perverseness: and thou a God of forgivenesses, merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and great of mercy, and thou didst not forsake them.
{9:18} Also when they made to them a molten calf, and they will say, This thy God which brought thee up from Egypt; and they will make great reproaches;
{9:19} And thou in thy many compassions forsookest them not in the desert: not removing the pillar of cloud from above them in the day to guide them in the way; and the pillar of fire in the night, to enlighten to them, and the way that they shall go in it.
{9:20} And thy good spirit thou gavest to instruct them, and thy manna thou didst not withhold from their mouth, and water gavest thou to them for their thirst.
{9:21} And forty years thou didst nourish them in the desert; they wanted not; their garments fell not away, and their feet swelled not.
{9:22} And thou wilt give to them kingdoms and nations, and thou wilt divide them to the extremity: and they will inherit the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, king of Bashan.
{9:23} And their sons thou didst multiply as the stars of the heavens, and thou wilt bring them to the land which thou saidst to their fathers to come in to possess.
{9:24} And their sons will come in and possess the land, and thou wilt subdue before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and thou wilt give them into their hand, and all their kings, and the nations of the land, to do them according to their will.
{9:25} And they will take inaccessible cities, and a fat land, and they will inherit houses full of all good, and wells hewed out, vineyards and olive trees, and the tree of food for abundance: and they will eat and be filled, and be fat, and will live delicately in thy great goodness.
{9:26} And they will be perverse, and they will rebel against thee, and they will cast thy law behind their back, and they killed thy prophets who testified against them to turn them back to thee, and they will make great reproaches.
{9:27} And thou wilt give them into the hand of their adversaries, and they will press upon them: and in the time of their straits they will cry to thee, and thou wilt hear from the heavens; and according to thy many compassion thou wilt give to them saviours, and they will save them from the hand of their adversaries.
{9:28} And when rest to them they will turn back to do evil before thee: and thou wilt leave them in the hand of their enemies, and they will come down upon them: and they will turn back and cry to thee, and thou from the heavens wilt hear, and wilt deliver them according to thy compassion, many times.
{9:29} And thou wilt testify against them to turn them back to thy law: and they acted proudly and heard not to thy commands, and in thy judgments they sinned in them; (which a man shall do and he lived in them) and they will give a shoulder turning aside, and they hardened their neck and heard not.
{9:30} And thou wilt protract over them many years, and thou wilt testify against them by thy spirit in the hand of thy prophets: and they gave not ear, and thou wilt give them into the hand of the people of the lands.
{9:31} And in thy many compassions thou madest them not a finishing, and thou didst not forsake them; for thou a God merciful and compassionate.
{9:32} And now our God, the great the mighty, and the terrible God, watching the covenant and the mercy, it shall not be little before thee all the distress which found us, to our kings, to our chiefs, to our priests, and to our prophets, and to our fathers, and to all thy people from the days of the kings of Assur even to this day.
{9:33} And thou art just for all brought upon us; for thou didst the truth and we were evil:
{9:34} And our kings, our chiefs, our priests and our fathers, they did not thy law, and they attended not to thy commands and thy testimonies which thou didst testify against them.
{9:35} And they in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness which thou gavest to them, and in the broad and fat land which thou gavest before them, served not thee, and turned not back from their evil works.
{9:36} Behold, we this day are servants, and the land which thou gavest to our fathers to eat its fruit and its goodness, behold, we are servants upon it:
{9:37} And its produce being much for the kings whom thou gavest over us in our sins: and ruling over our bodies and upon our cattle according to their will, and we in great straits.
{9:38} And for all this we cut out faithfulness, and write; and upon the sealing, our chiefs, our Levites, and our priests.

{12:43} And they will sacrifice in that day great sacrifices, and they will rejoice, for God caused them to rejoice with great gladness: and also the women and the children, rejoiced, and the gladness of Jerusalem will be heard even to far off.
{12:44} And in that day they will appoint men over the cells to the treasures for the oblations for the first-fruits and for the tenths to collect into them to the fields of the cities the portions of the law to the priests and to the Levites: for the gladness of Judah over the priests and over the Levites standing.
{12:45} And they will watch the watches of their God, and the watches of the purification, and those singing, and the gate-keepers, according to the command of David, and of Solomon his son.
{12:46} For in the days of, David and Asaph from of old the head of those singing, and the song of praise and confessions to God.
{12:47} And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah giving, portions, of the singers and the gate-keepers, the word of a day in its day: and consecrating to the Levites; and the Levites consecrating to the sons of Aaron.
{13:1} In that day was read in the book of Moses in the ears of the people; and it was found written in it that there shall not come in an Ammonite and a Moabite to the convocation of God, even to forever;
{13:2} For they anticipated not the sons of Israel with bread and with water, and he will hire Balaam against him to curse him: and God will turn the curse to blessing.
{13:3} And it will be in their hearing the law, and they will separate all the mixture from Israel.
{13:4} And before this, Eliashib the priest being given over the cells of the house of our God, being near to Tobiah:
{13:5} And he will make for him a great cell, and there before them were given the gifts, the frankincense and the vessels, and the tenth of the grain of the new wine and the new oil, (the command of the Levites, and those singing, and the gate-keepers,) and the oblations of the priests.
{13:6} And in all this I was not in Jerusalem: for in the thirty and second year to Arthasatha king of Babel, I came to the king, and at the end of days I asked for myself from the king:
{13:7} And I shall come to Jerusalem, and I shall understand upon the evil which Eliashib did for Tobiah to prepare for him a cell in the enclosures of the house of God.
{13:8} And it will be greatly evil to me: and I shall cast forth all the vessels of the house of Tobiah without from the cell.
{13:9} And saying, and they will purify the cells: and I shall turn back there the vessels of the house of God, with the gift and the frankincense.
{13:10} And I shall know that the portions of the Levites were not given: and they will flee a man to his field, the Levites and those singing, doing the work.
{13:11} And I shall contend with the prefects, and say, Wherefore was the house of God forsaken? And I shall gather them together, and cause them to stand upon their standing.
{13:12} And all Judah brought the tenth of the grain and the new wine and the new oil to the treasuries.
{13:13} And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah from the Levites: and upon their hand Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah: for they were reckoned faithful: and upon them to divide out to their brethren.
{13:14} Remember to me, O my God, concerning this, and thou wilt not wipe out my kindness which I did in the house of my God, and in its watches.
{13:15} In those days I saw in Judah those treading the wine-presses in the Sabbath, and bringing in the sheaves, and loading upon the asses; and also wine, grapes, and figs, and every burden, and bringing into Jerusalem in the day of the Sabbath: and I shall testify in the day of their selling provision.
{13:16} And the Tyrians sat in it, bringing in fish and every selling, and selling in the Sabbath to the sons of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
{13:17} And I shall contend with the nobles of Judah, and say to them, What this evil word that ye are doing, and profaning the day of the Sabbath?
{13:18} Did not your fathers thus, and our God will bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? and ye are adding burning upon Israel to profane the Sabbath.
{13:19} And it will be as the gates of Jerusalem were darkened before the Sabbath, and saying, and the doors shall be shut, and saying that they shall not open them till after the Sabbath: and from my young men I caused to stand at the gates; a burden shall not be brought in in the day of the Sabbath.
{13:20} And the merchants and those selling every selling will lodge from without to Jerusalem once and twice.
{13:21} And I shall testify against them, and say to them, Wherefore are ye lodging before the wall? if ye shall do it a second time I will stretch forth the hand against you From that time they came not upon the Sabbath.
{13:22} And saying to the Levites that they shall be purifying, and coming, watching the gates to consecrate the day of the Sabbath. Also this remember for me, O my God, and spare upon me according to the multitude of thy mercy.
{13:23} Also in those days I saw Jews who caused to dwell women, Ashdodites, Ammonites, Moabites:
{13:24} And their sons half speaking the Ashdod dialect, and they not knowing to speak the Judean dialect, and according to the tongue of people and people.
{13:25} And I shall contend with them, and I shall curse them and I shall strike of them men, and I shall make them bald, and cause them to swear by God, If ye shall give your daughters to their sons, and if ye shall lift up from their daughters to your sons and to yourselves.
{13:26} Did not Solomon king of Israel sin concerning these? and in many nations was there not a king like him, and he was loved by his God, and God will give him king over all Israel: also him did women strangers cause to sin.
{13:27} And to you shall we hear to do all this great evil to transgress against our God to cause strange women to dwell.
{13:28} And from the sons of Joiada, son of Eliashib the great priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: and I shall cause him to flee from me.
{13:29} Remember to them, O my God, for the pollutions of the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
{13:30} And I cleansed them from every stranger, and I shall set up watches to the priests and to the Levites, a man in his work.
{13:31} And for the bringing near the woods in the times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember to me, O my God for good.
