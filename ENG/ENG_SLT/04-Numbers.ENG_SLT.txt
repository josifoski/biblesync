{5:13} And a man lay with her with emission of seed, and it was hid from the eyes of her husband, and it was covered, and she was defiled, and no witness against her, and she was not taken hold of.
{5:14} And the spirit of jealousy passed upon him, and he was jealous of his wife, and she was defiled: or the spirit of jealousy passed upon him, and he was jealous of his wife, and she was not defiled:
{5:15} And the man brought forth his wife to the priest, and brought her offering for her, the tenth of an ephah of flour of barley; he shall not pour oil upon it, and he shall not give frankincense upon it, for it the gift of jealousy, the gift of remembrance, bringing iniquity to remembrance.

{5:19} And the priest bound her by an oath, and said to the woman, If a man lay not with thee, and thou didst not turn aside to be defiled instead of thy husband, be thou unpunished from the water of contradiction, causing the curse.
{5:20} And if thou didst turn aside instead of thy husband, and if thou wert defiled, and a man gave with thee his bed besides thy husband;
{5:21} And the priest bound the woman by an oath in these curses, and the priest said to the woman, Jehovah will give thee for a curse, and for an oath in the midst of thy people, in Jehovah's giving thy thigh to fall, and thy belly to go forth.
{5:22} And the waters causing the curse shall come into thy bowels, and cause thy belly to come forth, and thy thigh to fall. And the woman said, Amen, amen.
{5:23} And the priest wrote these curses in a book, and he wiped off into the water of contradiction.
{5:24} And he caused the woman to drink the water of contradiction causing the curse; and the waters causing the curse shall come into her for contradiction.
{5:25} And the priest took out of the hand of the woman the gift of jealousy, and lifted up the gift before Jehovah and brought it to the altar.
{5:26} And the priest took with the hand from the gift its remembrance, and burnt upon the altar, and afterward he shall cause the woman to drink the water.
{5:27} And he caused her to drink the water, and it was if she was defiled and she shall cover the transgression against her husband, and the waters causing the curse came into her for contradiction, and her belly came forth, and her thigh fell, and the woman was for a curse in the midst of her people.
{5:28} And if the woman was not defiled and she was clean, and she was unpunished, and conceived seed.
{5:29} This the law of jealousies, when a woman shall turn aside instead of her husband, and she was defiled;
{5:30} Or a man, when the spirit of jealousy shall pass over upon him, and he was jealous of his wife, and he made the woman stand before Jehovah, and the priest did to her all this law.
{5:31} And the man was clean from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.

{6:11} And the priest did the one for sin, and one for a burnt-offering, and he expiated for him for what he sinned for the soul, and he consecrated his head in that day.
{6:12} And he consecrated to Jehovah the day of his consecration, and he brought a lamb, the son of a year, for trespass: and the former days shall fall because his consecration was defiled.
{6:13} And this the law of him consecrated: in the day of filling up the days of his consecration, he shall bring himself to the door of the tent of appointment:
{6:14} And he brought his offering to Jehovah, one blameless lamb, the son of his year, for a burnt-offering, and one blameless ewe lamb, the daughter of her year, for the sin, and one blameless ram for peace;
{6:15} And a basket of unleavened of fine flour cakes mingled with oil, and thin unleavened cakes anointed with oil, and their gifts and their libations.
{6:16} And the priest brought before Jehovah, and did his sin and his burnt-offering.
{6:17} And the ram he shall do a sacrifice of peace to Jehovah, upon the basket of unleavened: and the priest did his gift and his libation.
{6:18} And he being consecrated, shaved the head of his consecration at the door of the tent of appointment, and took the hair of the head of his consecration, and gave upon the fire which under the sacrifice of peace.
{6:19} And the priest took the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake from the basket, and one thin unleavened cake, and gave upon the hands of him consecrated, after his shaving his consecration.
{6:20} And the priest lifted them up a lifting up before Jehovah: it holy to the priest upon the breast of the lifting up and upon the leg of the offering: and afterwards, he being consecrated shall drink wine.
{6:21} This the law of him consecrated who shall vow his offering to Jehovah for his consecration, besides what his hand shall attain: according to his vow which he vowed, so shall he do according to the law of his consecration.
{6:22} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{6:23} Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, So shall ye praise the sons of Israel, saying to them,
{6:24} Jehovah shall praise thee, and watch thee.
{6:25} Jehovah shall make his face shine upon thee and shall compassionate thee.
{6:26} Jehovah shall lift up his face to thee, and put peace to thee.
{6:27} And they put my name upon the sons of Israel and I will praise them.
{7:1} And it shall be in the day Moses finished to set up the dwelling, and he will anoint it, and he will consecrate it, and all its vessels, and the altar and all its vessels, and he will anoint them, and consecrate them.

{7:4} And Jehovah will say to Moses, saying,
{7:5} Take from them, and they were to serve the service of the tent of appointment; and they gave them to the Levites, to a man according to his service.
{7:6} And Moses will take the wagons and the oxen, and will give them to the Levites.
{7:7} Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service.
{7:8} And four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
{7:9} And to the sons of Kohath, he gave not, for the service of the holy place upon them, they shall lift up upon the shoulder.
{7:10} And the chiefs shall bring the consecration of the altar in the day of anointing it, and the chiefs shall bring an offering before the altar.

{8:2} Speak to Aaron, and say to him, In thy raising up of the lamps, to the front of the face of the chandelier shall the seven lamps enlighten.
{8:3} And Aaron will do so; to the front of the face of the chandelier he caused the lamps to ascend, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

{8:16} For being given, they were given to me from the midst of the sons of Israel; instead of the first-born cleaving every womb, every one from the sons of Israel, have I taken them to me.
{8:17} For to me all the first-born among the sons of Israel among man and among cattle: in the day I struck every first-born in the land of Egypt I consecrated them to me.
{8:18} And I will take the Levites instead of all the first-born among the sons of Israel.
{8:19} And I will give the Levites, being given to Aaron and to his sons, from the midst of the sons of Israel, to work the works of the sons of Israel in the tent of appointment, and to expiate for the sons of Israel: and there shall not be a blow among the sons of Israel, in the sons of Israel coming to the holy place.

{9:5} And they will do the passover in the first, in the fourteenth day of the month, between the evenings, in the desert of Sinai: according to all which Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the sons of Israel.
{9:6} And there shall be men who were unclean by the soul of man, and they will not be able to do the passover in that day: and they came near before Moses and before Aaron, in that day:
{9:7} And these men will say to him, We are unclean by the soul of man: wherefore shall we be withheld so as not to bring near an offering of Jehovah at his appointment, in the midst of the sons of Israel?
{9:8} And Moses will say to them, Stand ye, and I will hear what Jehovah will command for you.
{9:9} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{9:10} Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, A man, a man when he shall be unclean by the soul, or in a way far off to you or to your generations, and he did the passover to Jehovah.
{9:11} In the second month, in the fourteenth day, between the evenings they shall do it, upon unleavened and bitter herbs they shall eat it.
{9:12} They shall not leave from it till morning, and a bone they shall not break in it: according to all the laws of the passover they shall do it.
{9:13} And the man who is clean, and was not in the way, and failed to do the passover, that soul was cut off from its people; for he brought not the offering of Jehovah at his appointment, that man shall bear his sin.
{9:14} And when a stranger shall sojourn with you, and he did the passover to Jehovah; according to the law of the passover and according to its judgment, so shall he do: one law shall be to you, and to the stranger, and to the native of the land.
{9:15} And in the day of the raising up the dwelling the cloud covered the dwelling of the tent of testimony: and in the evening it shall be upon the tent as the appearance of fire till morning.
{9:16} So shall it be always: the cloud shall cover it, and the appearance of fire by night.
{9:17} And when the cloud went up from the tent, and after this the sons of Israel shall remove: and in the place where the cloud shall dwell there, there shall the sons of Israel encamp.
{9:18} At the mouth of Jehovah the sons of Israel will remove, and at the mouth of Jehovah they will encamp: all the days which the cloud shall dwell upon the dwelling they shall encamp.
{9:19} And in the prolonging of the cloud upon the dwelling many days, and the sons of Israel shall watch the watches of Jehovah, and they shall not remove.
{9:20} And it is, when the cloud shall be days of number upon the dwelling, at the mouth of Jehovah they shall encamp, and at the mouth of Jehovah they shall remove.
{9:21} And it is when the cloud shall be from evening to morning, and the cloud went up in the morning, and they shall remove: either day or by night, and the cloud went up and they removed.
{9:22} Or days, or a month, or days, in the prolonging of the cloud upon the dwelling to dwell upon it, the sons of Israel shall encamp, and they shall not remove; and in its going up they shall remove.
{9:23} At the mouth of Jehovah they shall encamp, and at the mouth of Jehovah, they shall remove; the watches of Jehovah they watched, at the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.
{10:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{10:2} Make to thyself two trumpets of silver; turned work shalt thou make them: and they were to thee for calling the assembly and for the removing the camp.
{10:3} And they sounded with them, and they assembled to thee all the assembly at the door of the tent of appointment.
{10:4} And if they shall sound with one, and to thee assembled the chiefs of the heads of the thousands of Israel.
{10:5} And ye sounded the signal, and the camps encamping eastward, removed.
{10:6} And ye sounded the signal the second time, and the camps encamping to the south, removed: they shall sound the signal for their removings.
{10:7} And in the assembly being gathered together, ye shall sound, and shall not sound loud.
{10:8} And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall sound with the trumpets; and they were to you for a law forever to your generations.
{10:9} And when ye shall go out to war in your land against the enemy pressing you, and ye sounded the signal in the trumpets; and ye were remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye were saved from your enemies.
{10:10} And in the day of your gladness, and in your appointments, and in the heads of your mouths, and ye shall sound with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace; and they were to you for a remembrance before your God: I am Jehovah your God.
{10:11} And it shall be in the second year, in the second month, in the twentieth of the month, the cloud was taken up from the dwelling of testimony.
{10:12} And the sons of Israel will remove for their departure from the desert of Sinai; and the cloud will dwell in the desert of Paran.

{10:28} These the departures of the sons of Israel according to their army, and they shall remove.
{10:29} And Moses will say to Hobab, son of Raguel the Midianite, father-in-law of Moses, We are removing to the place which Jehovah said, I will give it to you: come thou with us, and we did good to thee; for Jehovah spake good concerning Israel.
{10:30} And he will say to him, I will not go; but to my land, and to my kindred I will go.
{10:31} And he will say, Thou shalt not leave us now, for upon this thou knewest we encamped in the desert, and thou wert to us for eyes.
{10:32} And it being when thou shalt go with us, it being that which Jehovah will do good with us and we did good to thee.
{10:33} And they will remove from the mountain of God, a way of three days: and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah removed before them, a way of three days, to search out for them a rest.
{10:34} And the cloud of Jehovah upon them the day in their removing out of the camp.
{10:35} And it shall be in removing the ark Moses will say, Rise, Jehovah, and thine enemies shall be scattered; and they hating thee shall flee from before thee.
{10:36} And in its encamping, he will say, Turn back, Jehovah, to the ten thousand thousands of Israel.
{11:1} And the people shall be as complainers, and it was evil in the ears of Jehovah; and Jehovah will hear, and his anger will kindle, and the fire of Jehovah will burn among them and will consume in the extremity of the camp.
{11:2} And the people will cry to Moses and Moses will pray to Jehovah, and the fire will subside.
{11:3} And he will call the name of that place Taberah, for the fire of Jehovah burnt among them.
{11:4} And the scraped together which in its midst will long a longing; and the sons of Israel also will turn back and weep, and they will say, Who will feed us with flesh?
{11:5} We remembered the fish which we ate in Egypt gratuitously; the cucumbers and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlics.
{11:6} And now our soul shall be dried up; not any thing but to the manna our eyes.
{11:7} And the manna it as the seed of coriander, and its eye as the eye of bdellium.
{11:8} The people went to and fro, and gathered and ground in the mill, or crushed in the mortar, and boiled in the pot, and made it cakes; and its taste was as the taste of a sweet cake of oil.
{11:9} And in the descending of the dew upon the camp by night the manna descended upon it.
{11:10} And Moses will hear the people weeping to their families, each at the door of his tent: and the wrath of Jehovah was kindled greatly; and it was evil in the eyes of Moses.
{11:11} And Moses will say to Jehovah, For what hast thou done evil to thy servant? and for what did I not find grace in thine eyes, to put the debt of all this people upon me?
{11:12} Did I form all this people? did I beget them? for thou wilt say to me, Lift them up into thy bosom, as a nurse will lift up the sucking child upon the land which thou swarest to their fathers.
{11:13} Whence to me flesh to give to all this people? for they weep upon me, saying, Thou shalt give to us flesh and we shall eat.
{11:14} I shall not be able to lift up alone all this people, for it is heavy for me.
{11:15} And if so thou doest to me, killing, kill me now, if I found grace in thine eyes; and I shall not look upon my evil.
{11:16} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the old men of Israel, whom thou knewest that they were old men of the people, and their scribes; and take them to the tent of appointment, and they shall stand there with thee.
{11:17} And I came down and I spake with thee there; and I took from the spirit which is upon thee, and I put upon them, and they lifted up with thee in the debt of the people, and thou shalt not lift it up thyself alone.
{11:18} And thou shalt say to the people, Be ye consecrated for the morrow, and ye ate flesh: for ye wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall feed us with flesh? for it was good to us in Egypt; and Jehovah gave to you flesh, and ye ate.
{11:19} Not one day shall ye eat, and not two days, and not five days, and not ten days, and not twenty days;
{11:20} Even to a month of days, till when it shall come out from your nostrils, and it shall be to you for loathsomeness, because that ye rejected Jehovah who is in the midst of you, and ye shall weep before him, saying, Wherefore came we out of Egypt?
{11:21} And Moses will say, Six hundred thousand of foot the people which I am in the midst of them: and thou saidst, I will give flesh to them, and they shall eat a month of days.
{11:22} Shall the sheep and the oxen be slaughtered for them and suffice for them? and if he shall gather all the fish of the sea to them, and it suffice for them?
{11:23} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Shall the hand of Jehovah be cut off? Now shalt thou see my word shall be precious to thee or not.
{11:24} And Moses will go forth, and will speak to the people the words of Jehovah; and he will gather the seventy men, of the old men of the people, and he will cause them to stand round about the tent.
{11:25} And Jehovah will come down in the cloud, and will speak to him, and he will take from the spirit which is upon him, and will give upon the seventy men, the old men: and it shall be in the resting of the spirit upon them, and they shall prophesy, and they shall not cease.
{11:26} And two men remained in the camp, the name of the one Eldad, and the name of the second, Medad: and the spirit will encamp upon them; and they among those being written, and they will not go forth to the tent, and they will prophesy in the camp.
{11:27} And a young man will run and announce to Moses, and he will say, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.
{11:28} And Joshua, son of Nun, serving Moses from his chosen, will answer and say, My lord Moses, restrain them.
{11:29} And Moses will say to him, Thou envying for me; and who will give all the people of Jehovah prophets? when Jehovah will give his spirit upon them.
{11:30} And Moses will take himself into the camp, he and the old men of Israel.
{11:31} And a spirit removed from Jehovah and it will divide out the quails from the sea, and will cast upon the camp, as the way of a day hither, and the way of a day thither, round about the camp, and as two cubits upon the face of the earth.
{11:32} And the people will rise up all that day and all the night, and all the day of the morrow, and will gather the quails: the few gathered ten homers; and they will spread for themselves a spreading round about the camp.
{11:33} And the flesh yet between their teeth, before it shall be withdrawn and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah will smite upon them an exceeding great blow.
{11:34} And he will call the name of that place, The Graves of Longings, for there they buried the people longing.
{11:35} From the Graves of Longings the people removed to the enclosures, and they shall be in the enclosures.
{12:1} And Miriam and Aaron will speak against Moses on account of the Ethiopian woman which he took: for he took an Ethiopian woman.
{12:2} And they will say, Did Jehovah only now speak by Moses? Did he not also speak by us? And Jehovah will hear.
{12:3} And the man Moses greatly humble, more than all the men upon the face of the earth.
{12:4} And Jehovah will say in a moment to Moses and to Aaron and to Miriam, Come forth ye three unto the tent of appointment And they three will come forth.
{12:5} And Jehovah will come down in the pillar of the cloud, and will stand at the door of the tent, and will call Aaron and Miriam, and they two will come forth.
{12:6} And he will say, Hear ye now, my word: If there shall be your prophet of Jehovah, in a vision I will be known to him; in a dream I will speak to him.
{12:7} Not so my servant Moses; he was faithful in all my house.
{12:8} Mouth to mouth I will speak to him, and in appearance and not in enigmas; and the portion of Jehovah shall he behold: and wherefore were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?
{12:9} And the anger of Jehovah will kindle against them; and he will go.
{12:10} And the cloud removed from the tent; and behold, Miriam being leprous as snow: and Aaron will look upon Miriam, and behold, her being leprous.
{12:11} And Aaron will say to Moses, With leave, my lord, now thou shalt not put upon us the sin in which we were foolish, and in which we sinned.
{12:12} Now shall she not be as the dead, which in his coming forth from the womb of his mother, and his flesh shall be half consumed?
{12:13} And Moses will cry to Jehovah, saying, God heal her now.
{12:14} And Jehovah will say to Moses, And her father spitting, spit in her face, shall she not be ashamed seven days? She shall be shut seven days without the camp, and afterward she shall be taken back.
{12:15} And Miriam shall be shut without the camp seven days, and the people removed not till Miriam was taken back.
{12:16} And afterward the people removed from the enclosures, and they will encamp in the desert of Paran.
{13:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{13:2} Send for thyself men, and they shall search out the land of Canaan, which I give to the sons of Israel: one man, one man for the tribe of his fathers shall ye send, all chiefs among them.
{13:3} And Moses will send them from the desert of Paran, at the mouth of Jehovah; all of them chiefs, the heads of the sons of Israel.
{13:4} And these their names: for the tribe of Reuben: Shammua, son of Zaccur.
{13:5} For the tribe of Simeon: Shaphat, son of Hori.
{13:6} For the tribe of Judah: Caleb, son of Jephunneh.
{13:7} For the tribe of Issachar: Igal, son of Joseph.
{13:8} For the tribe of Ephraim: Oshea, son of Nun.
{13:9} For the tribe of Benjamin: Palti, son of Raphu.
{13:10} For the tribe of Zebulon: Gaddiel, son of Sodi.
{13:11} For the tribe of Joseph, for the tribe of Manasseh: Gaddi, son of Susi.
{13:12} For the tribe of Dan: Ammiel, son of Gemalli.
{13:13} For the tribe of Asher: Sethur, son of Michael.
{13:14} For the tribe of Naphtali: Nahbi, son of Vophsi.
{13:15} For the tribe of Gad: Geuel, son of Machi.
{13:16} These the names of the men which Moses sent to search out the land. And Moses will call Oshea, son of Nun, Joshua.
{13:17} And Moses will send them to search out the land of Canaan, and will say to them, Go ye up hither to the south and ascend the mountain,
{13:18} And see the land what it is, and the people dwelling upon it, whether it is strong or relaxed, whether it is few or many;
{13:19} And what the land that they dwell in it, whether it is good or evil; and what the cities that they shall dwell in them, whether in camps or in fortifications;
{13:20} And what the land, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is in it wood or not And be strong, and take from the fruit of the land. And the days, the days of the first-fruits of the grapes.
{13:21} And they will go up and will search out the land from the desert of Zin even to Rehob, to go to Hameth.
{13:22} And they will go up by the south and will come to Hebron; and these Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, children of Anak: and Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.
{13:23} And they will go up to the valley of Esheol, and will cut off from there a branch and one cluster of grapes, and they will lift upon a rod upon two; and from the pomegranates, and from the figs.
{13:24} And he called that place the valley of Eshool, on account of the cluster of grapes which the sons of Israel cut off from there.
{13:25} And they will turn back from searching out the land at the end of forty days.
{13:26} And they will go, and come to Moses and to Aaron, and to all the assembly of the sons of Israel to the desert of Paran to Kadesh, and will give them back word, and all the assembly, and they will shew them the fruit of the land.
{13:27} And they will recount to him, and will say, We came to the land where thou sentest us, and also it flowed with milk and honey; and this its fruit.
{13:28} Only that the people are strong dwelling upon the land, and the cities fortified, and very great: and also we saw the children of Anak there.
{13:29} Amalek will dwell in the land of the south; and the Hittites and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, will dwell in the mountain; and the Canaanites will dwell by the sea, and by the hand of Jordan.
{13:30} And Caleb will silence the people to Moses, and will say, Going up, we will go up and inherit it; for being able we shall overcome it.
{13:31} And the men who went with him said, We shall not be able to go up against the people, for they are strong above us.
{13:32} And they will bring forth slander of the land which they searched it out to the sons of Israel, saying, The land which we passed through upon it, to search it out, is a land consuming those dwelling upon it: and all the people which we saw in the midst of it, men being long.
{13:33} And there we saw the giants, sons of Anak, from the giants: and we were in our eyes as the locusts, and so were we in their eyes.
{14:1} And all the assembly will lift up and give their voice; and the people will weep in that night.
{14:2} And all the children of Israel will murmur against Moses, and against Aaron; and all the assembly will say to them, Would we died in the land of Egypt! or in this desert would that we died!
{14:3} And wherefore does Jehovah bring us to this land to fall by the sword? our wives and our little ones shall be for a prey. Would it not be good for us to turn back to Egypt?
{14:4} And they will say, a man to his brother, We will give a head, and turn back to Egypt.
{14:5} And Moses will fall, and Aaron, upon their faces before all the gathering of the assembly of the sons of Israel.
{14:6} And Joshua, son of Nun, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh, from those searching out the land, tare their garments.
{14:7} And they will speak to all the assembly of the sons of Israel, saying, The land which we passed over upon it to search it out, a good land exceedingly, exceedingly,
{14:8} If Jehovah delight in us, and he brought us to this land, and he gave it to us; a land which it flowing with milk and honey.
{14:9} But against Jehovah ye shall not rebel, and ye shall not be afraid of the people of the land; for they our bread: for their shadow removed from them and Jehovah with us; ye shall not be afraid of them.
{14:10} And all the assembly will say to stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah was seen in the tent of appointment to all the sons of Israel.
{14:11} And Jehovah will say to Moses How long will this people reject me and how long will they not believe in me by all the signs which I did in the midst of them?
{14:12} I will strike them with death, and I will destroy them, and I will make thee into a great nation, and strong above them.
{14:13} And Moses will say to Jehovah, And the Egyptians heard, for thou didst bring up with thy strength this people from the midst of them;
{14:14} And they will say to those dwelling upon this land; they heard that thou Jehovah art in the midst of this people who wert seen eye to eye; thou Jehovah and thy cloud stood over them, and in a pillar of cloud thou goest before them by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.
{14:15} And didst thou kill this people as one man, and the nations spake who heard thy fame, saying,
{14:16} Because Jehovah will not be able to bring in this people to the land which he sware to them, he will slay them in the desert.
{14:17} And now shall the strength of the Lord be great, as thou spakest, saying,
{14:18} Jehovah, slow to anger and of great kindness, lifting up iniquity and transgression and cleansing, will not cleanse; striking the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, upon the third, and upon the fourth.
{14:19} Forgive now the sin of this people according to thy great kindness, and as thou didst lift up to this people, and even till now.
{14:20} And Jehovah will say, I pardoned according to thy word:
{14:21} But yet I live, and the glory of Jehovah shall fill all the earth.
{14:22} For all the men having seen my glory and my signs which I did in Egypt and in the desert, and they will try me this ten times, they heard not to my voice.
{14:23} If they shall see the land which I sware to their fathers, and all despising me shall not see it.
{14:24} And my servant Caleb, because another spirit was with him, and he will follow after me, and I brought him into the land which he went there; and his seed shall inherit it.
{14:25} And the Amalekites and the Canaanites will dwell in the valley. Tomorrow turn ye; they shall remove for you into the desert the way of the sea of sedge.
{14:26} And Jehovah will speak to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
{14:27} How long for this evil assembly, that they are murmuring against me? the murmurings of the sons of Israel which they are murmuring against me, I heard.
{14:28} Say to them, I live, says Jehovah, if not as ye spake in mine ears, so will I do to you:
{14:29} In this desert shall your carcasses fall; and all of you being reviewed according to all your number, from the son of twenty years and above, who murmured against me.
{14:30} If ye shall come in to the land which I lifted up my hand for you to dwell in it, except Caleb, son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, son of Nun.
{14:31} And your little ones which ye said shall be for a prey, and I brought them in, and they shall know the land which ye rejected.
{14:32} And you, your carcasses shall fall in this desert.
{14:33} And your sons shall be fed in the desert forty years, and bear your fornications till your carcasses be finished in the desert.
{14:34} According to the number of days which ye searched out the land, forty days, a day a year, a day for a year, shall ye your iniquities; forty years, and ye knew my withdrawal.
{14:35} I Jehovah spake, if not, I will do this to all this evil assembly setting up against me: in this desert shall they be finished, and there shall they die.
{14:36} And the men whom Moses sent to search out the land, and they will turn back and will murmur against him to all the assembly, to bring forth slander upon the land.
{14:37} And the men bringing forth evil slander of the land shall die by the blow before Jehovah.
{14:38} And Joshua, son of Nun, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh, lived, from those men going to search out the land.
{14:39} And Moses will speak these words to all the sons of Israel, and the people will mourn greatly.
{14:40} And they will rise early in the morning, and will go up to the head of the mountain, saying, Behold us, and we will go up to the place which Jehovah said: for we sinned.
{14:41} And Moses will say, Wherefore this you are passing by the mouth of Jehovah? And it shall not prosper.
{14:42} Ye shall not go up, for Jehovah is not in the midst of you; and shall ye not be struck before your enemies?
{14:43} For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye fell by the sword: for ye turned back from after Jehovah, and Jehovah will not be with you.
{14:44} And they will act proudly to go up to the head of the mountain: and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and Moses departed not out of the midst of the camp.
{14:45} And Amalek came down, and the Canaanite, he dwelling in the mountain, and he will smite them, and will beat them, even to Hormah.
{15:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{15:2} Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When ye shall come into the land of your dwellings, which I give to you,
{15:3} And ye did a sacrifice to Jehovah, a burnt-offering or a sacrifice to separate a vow, or in willingness, or in your assemblies, to make an odor of sweetness to Jehovah, from the oxen or from the sheep:
{15:4} And he bringing near, brought near his offering to Jehovah, a gift of fine flour, the tenth mingled with the fourth of the bin of oil.
{15:5} And wine for a libation, the fourth of the hin, thou shalt do upon the burnt-offering or to the sacrifice for the one lamb.
{15:6} Or to the ram thou shalt do a gift of fine flour, two tenths mingled with oil, the third of the hin.
{15:7} And wine for a libation the third of the hin, thou shalt bring an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
{15:8} And when thou shalt do the son of a cow, a burnt-offering or sacrifice to separate a vow, or peace to Jehovah:
{15:9} And he brought upon the son of a cow a gift of fine flour, three tenths mingled with oil, half the bin.
{15:10} And wine thou shalt bring for a libation, half the hin, a sacrifice, an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
{15:11} Thus shall it be done to the one bullock or to the one ram, or to the sheep with the lambs, or with the goats.
{15:12} According to the number which ye shall do, so shall ye do to the one according to their number.
{15:13} Every native shall do thus with these to bring near a sacrifice, an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
{15:14} And when a stranger shall sojourn with you, or whoever in the midst of you for your generations, and he did a sacrifice, an odor of sweetness to Jehovah; as ye shall do, so shall he do.
{15:15} One law for you of the assembly, and for the stranger sojourning; a law forever to your generations: as ye, so the stranger shall be before Jehovah.
{15:16} One law and one judgment shall be to you, and to the stranger sojourning with you.
{15:17} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{15:18} Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, In your going into the land where I bring you there,
{15:19} And it was in your eating from the bread of the land, ye shall lift up a lifting up to Jehovah.
{15:20} The first of your groats, a cake, shall ye lift up a lifting up; as the lifting up of the threshing floor, so shall ye lift it up.
{15:21} From the first of your groats, shall ye give to Jehovah a lifting up, for your generations.
{15:22} And when ye shall err, and shall not do all these commands which Jehovah spake to Moses,
{15:23} All which Jehovah commanded to you by the hand of Moses from the day which Jehovah commanded, and onward to your generations;
{15:24} And it was if from the eyes of the assembly there was done in error, all the assembly did a bullock, the son of a cow, for a burnt-offering, for an odor of sweetness to Jehovah, and its gift and its libation, according to judgment, and one he goat of the goats for sin.
{15:25} And the priest expiated for all the assembly of the sons of Israel, and it was forgiven to them; for it is an error; and they brought their offering a sacrifice to Jehovah, and their sin before Jehovah, for their error.
{15:26} And it was forgiven to all the assembly of the sons of Israel, and to the stranger sojourning in the midst of them, to all the people in error.
{15:27} And if one soul shall sin in error, and he brought a she goat the daughter of a goat, for sin.
{15:28} And the priest expiated for the soul erring, in sinning in error before Jehovah, to expiate for him; and it was forgiven to him.
{15:29} The native among the sons of Israel, and to the stranger sojourning in the midst of them, one law shall be to you, for doing in error.
{15:30} And the soul which shall do with a high hand, from the native, and from the stranger, it reproaches Jehovah, and that soul was cut off from the midst of its people.
{15:31} For it despised the word of Jehovah, and broke his command; being cut off, that soul shall be cut off; its iniquity upon it.
{15:32} And the sons of Israel shall be in the desert, and they shall find a man gathering wood in the day of the Sabbath.
{15:33} And they having found him, will bring him gathering wood to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the assembly.
{15:34} And they will put him in watch, for it was not specified what shall be done to him.
{15:35} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Dying, the man shall die: all the assembly stoned him with stones without the camp.
{15:36} And all the assembly shall bring him forth without the camp, and they shall stone him with stones, and he shall die; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
{15:37} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{15:38} Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, They made to them fringes of flowers upon the wings of their garment for their generations; and they gave upon the fringes of the wing a thread of cerulean purple;
{15:39} And it was to you for fringes, and ye saw it, and ye remembered all the commands of Jehovah, and ye did them; and ye shall not seek after your heart, and after your eyes, which ye committed fornication after them.
{15:40} So that ye shall remember, and ye did all my commands, and ye were holy to your God.
{15:41} I am Jehovah your God who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to be to you for God; I am Jehovah your God.
{16:1} And Korah son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, will take, and Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab; and On, son of Peleth, sons of Reuben;
{16:2} And they will rise up before Moses, and men from the sons of Israel, fifty and two hundred chiefs of the assembly, called by appointment, and men of name:
{16:3} And they will gather together against Moses, and against Aaron, and they will say to them, Much to you for all the assembly, all of them are holy, and Jehovah in the midst of them: and wherefore shall be lifted up over the gathering of Jehovah?
{16:4} And Moses will hear, and will fall upon his face:
{16:5} And he will speak to Korah and to all his assembly, saying, The morning Jehovah will make known who is to him, and the holy; and bring near to him: and whom he will choose for him he will bring near to himself.
{16:6} This do ye: take to you censers, Korah and all his assembly:
{16:7} And ye shall give fire in them and put upon them incense, before Jehovah to-morrow: and it was the man whom Jehovah shall choose, he is holy: much to you, ye sons of Levi.
{16:8} And Moses will say to Korah, Hear, now, ye sons of Levi:
{16:9} Is this small for you that the God of Israel separated you from the assembly of Israel to bring you near to him to serve the services of the dwelling of Jehovah, and to stand before the assembly to serve them?
{16:10} He will bring thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and did ye seek also the priesthood?
{16:11} For this thou and all thine assembly being collected together against Jehovah: and Aaron, what is he that ye shall murmur against him?
{16:12} And Moses will send to call for Dathan and for Abiram, sons of Eliab and they will say, We will not come up.
{16:13} Is this small that thou broughtest us up from a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert, that thou ruling also wilt rule over us?
{16:14} But not to a land flowing with milk and honey didst thou bring us; and wilt thou give to us the inheritance of field and vineyard? the eyes of these men wilt thou bore out? we will not come up.
{16:15} And it will be kindled to Moses greatly, and he will say to Jehovah, Thou wilt not turn to their gift: not one ass did I take from them, and I did not evil to one of them.
{16:16} And Moses will say to Korah, Be thou and all thine assembly before Jehovah, thou and they, and Aaron, to-morrow:
{16:17} And take each his censer and put incense upon them, and bring them near before Jehovah, each his censer and put incense upon them, and bring them near before Jehovah, each his censer, fifty and two hundred censers; and thou and Aaron, each his censer.
{16:18} And they will take each his censer and will give upon them fire, and will put incense upon them, and they will stand at the door of the tent of appointment, and Moses and Aaron.
{16:19} And Korah will gather against them all the assembly at the door of the tent of appointment; and the glory of Jehovah will be seen to all the assembly.
{16:20} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, and to Aaron, saying,
{16:21} Separate yourselves from the midst of this assembly, and I will consume them as in a moment,
{16:22} And they shall fall upon their faces, and they will say, God, the God of the spirits for all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be angry against all the assembly.
{16:23} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{16:24} Speak to all the assembly, saying, Go up from round about the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
{16:25} And Moses will rise up and go to Dathan and Abiram; and the old men of Israel will go after him.
{16:26} And he will speak to the assembly, saying, Remove, now, from the tents of these guilty men, and ye shall not touch upon any thing which is to them lest ye shall he destroyed in all their sin.
{16:27} And they will go up from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, from round about; and Dathan and Abiram will come forth, standing at the door of their tents, and their wives and their sons and their little ones.
{16:28} And Moses will say, By this shall ye know that Jehovah sent me to do all these works; for not from my heart.
{16:29} If according to the death of all men these shall die, if the providence of all men shall be reviewed upon them, Jehovah sent me not.
{16:30} And if Jehovah shall create a creation, and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them and all which is to them, and they went down living to hades; and ye know that these men rejected Jehovah,
{16:31} And it shall be as he finished to speak all these words, the earth shall cleave asunder which is under them:
{16:32} And the earth shall open her mouth and shall swallow them and their houses, and all the men which to Korah, and all the possessions.
{16:33} And they went down, and all which is to them, living, to hades, and the earth shall cover over them; and they shall perish from the midst of the gathering.
{16:34} And all Israel which were round about them fled at their voice: for they said, Lest the earth shall swallow us.
{16:35} And a fire will come forth from Jehovah and will consume the fifty and two hundred men bringing the incense.
{16:36} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{16:37} Say to Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, and he shall take up the censers from the midst of the burning, and scatter the fire afar off; for they were consecrated.
{16:38} The censers of these sinners against their souls, and they made them beaten plates, a covering for the altar: for they brought them before Jehovah, and they will be consecrated: and they will be for a sign to the sons of Israel.
{16:39} And Eleazar the priest will take the brazen censers, which they being burnt brought near; and they shall beat them out a covering for the altar,
{16:40} A remembrance to the sons of Israel, so that a man, a stranger, shall not come near, he who is not from the seed of Aaron, to burn incense before Jehovah; and he shall not be as Korah and as his assembly: as Jehovah spake to him by the hand of Moses.
{16:41} And all the assembly of the sons of Israel will murmur on the morrow against Moses, and against Aaron, saying, Ye killed the people of Jehovah.
{16:42} And it shall be in the gathering together of the assembly against Moses and against Aaron, and they shall turn towards the tent of appointment; and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah will be seen.
{16:43} And Moses will go, and Aaron, before the tent of appointment.
{16:44} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{16:45} Lift up yourselves from the midst of this assembly, and I will consume them as in a moment. And they will fall upon their faces.
{16:46} And Moses will say to Aaron, Take a censer and give upon it fire from off the altar, and put incense, and go quickly to the assembly, and expiate for them: for anger went forth from before Jehovah; for it began smiting.
{16:47} And Aaron will take as Moses spake, and he will run into the midst of the assembly; and behold, it began smiting among the people: and he will give incense and will expiate for the people.
{16:48} And he will stand between the dead and between the living; and the smiting will be withheld.
{16:49} And they dying in the smiting will be fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides they dying for the words of Korah.
{16:50} And Aaron will turn back to Moses to the door of the tent of appointment: and the smiting was withheld.
{17:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{17:2} Speak to the sons of Israel, and take from them a rod, a rod according to the house of the father, from all the chiefs according to the house of their fathers, twelve rods: thou shalt write each his name upon his rod.
{17:3} And Aaron's name shalt thou write upon the rod of Levi: for one rod is for the head of the house of their fathers.
{17:4} And place them in the tent of appointment before the testimony, where I will pass over to you there.
{17:5} And it was the man whom I shall desire him, his rod shall be fruitful: and I caused to cease from me the murmurings of the sons of Israel which they are murmuring against you.
{17:6} And Moses will speak to the sons of Israel, and all their chiefs will give to him a rod for one chief, a rod for one chief, according to the house of their fathers, twelve rods: and Aaron's rod in the midst of their rods.
{17:7} And Moses will place the rods before Jehovah in the tent of testimony.
{17:8} And it shall be on the morrow, and Moses will go into the tent of testimony; and behold, Aaron's rod was fruitful for the house of Levi, and the blossom will come forth and the flower will flourish and will show almonds.
{17:9} And Moses will bring forth all the rods from before Jehovah to all the sons of Israel: and they shall see and shall take each his rod.
{17:10} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Turn back Aaron's rod before the testimony, for preservation, for a sign for the sons of contradiction; and thou shalt finish their murmurings from me, and they shall not die.
{17:11} And Moses will do: as Jehovah commanded him, so did he.
{17:12} And the sons of Israel will speak to Moses, saying, Behold, we expired, we perished, we all perished.
{17:13} All coming near, coming near the dwelling of Jehovah, and dying, shall die: shall we die to breathe out life?
{18:1} And Jehovah will say to Aaron, Thou, and thy sons, and thy father's house with thee, shall bear the iniquity of the holy place: and thou and thy sons with thee, shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
{18:2} And also thy brethren, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, and they shall be joined to thee, and they shall serve thee: and thou and thy sons with thee, before the tent of testimony.
{18:3} And they watched thy watches, and the watches of all the tent: but to the vessels of the holy place, and to the altar they shall not come near, and they shall not die, also they, also ye.
{18:4} And they were joined to thee, and they watched the watches of the tent of appointment for all the service of the tent: and the stranger shall not come near to you.
{18:5} And ye watched the watches of the holy place, and the watches of the altar; and anger shall no more be upon the sons of Israel.
{18:6} And I, behold, I took your brethren the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel: to you being given a gift to Jehovah to serve the services of the tent of appointment.
{18:7} And thou and thy sons with thee shall watch your priesthood for all the word of the altar, and to within the vail; and ye served: the services a gift I will give your priesthood; and the stranger coming near shall die.
{18:8} And Jehovah will speak to Aaron, And I, behold, I gave to thee the watches of my offerings for all the holy things of the sons of Israel; to thee I gave them, for the anointing, and to thy sons for a law forever.
{18:9} This shall be to thee from the holy of holies, from the fire: all their oblations for all their gifts, and for all their sins, and for all their sacrifices, which they shall give back to me, it is holy of holies to thee and to thy sons.
{18:10} In the holy of holies ye shall eat it; every male shall eat it: holy shall it be to thee.
{18:11} And this is to thee; the offerings of their gifts for all the liftings up of the sons of Israel: to thee I gave them, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, for a law forever: all clean in thy house shall eat it.
{18:12} All the fat of the oil, and all the fat of the new wine, and of the grain, their first-fruits which they shall give to Jehovah, to thee I gave them.
{18:13} The first-fruits, all which are in the land which they shall bring to Jehovah, shall be to thee; all clean in thy house shall eat it.
{18:14} Every thing consecrated in Israel shall be to thee.
{18:15} Every thing cleaving the womb for all flesh, which they shall bring to Jehovah, in man or in cattle, shall be to thee: but redeeming, thou shalt redeem the first-born of man, and the firstborn of unclean cattle thou shalt redeem.
{18:16} And those being redeemed from the son of a month, shalt thou redeem according to thy estimation, the silver of five shekels according to the holy shekel, it is twenty gerahs.
{18:17} But the first-born of a cow, or the first-born of a sheep, or the first-born of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: their blood shalt thou pour out upon the altar, and their fat thou shalt burn a sacrifice for an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
{18:18} And their flesh shall be to thee, as the breast of the lifting up, and as the right shoulder shall be to thee.
{18:19} All the offerings of the holy things which the sons of Israel shall lift up to Jehovah, I gave to thee, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, for a law forever: it a covenant of salt forever before Jehovah to thee, and to thy seed with thee.
{18:20} And Jehovah will say to Aaron, In their land thou shalt not inherit, and a portion shall not be to thee in the midst of them. I am thy portion and thine inheritance in the midst of the sons of Israel.
{18:21} And to the sons of Levi, behold, I gave all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance for their services which they served, the service of the tent of appointment.
{18:22} And the sons of Israel shall no more come near the tent of appointment, to bear sin and to die.
{18:23} And it is the Levite serving the service of the tent of appointment, and they shall bear their iniquity a law forever to your generations, and in the midst of the sons of Israel they shall not inherit an inheritance.
{18:24} For the tenth of the sons of Israel which they shall lift up to Jehovah, an offering I gave to the Levites to inherit: for this I said to them, In the midst of the sons of Israel they shall not inherit an inheritance.
{18:25} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{18:26} And to the Levites thou shalt speak and say to them, When ye shall take from the sons of Israel the truth which I gave to you from them for your inheritance, and ye lifted up an offering of Jehovah, a tenth from the tenth.
{18:27} And your offerings were reckoned to you as the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the filling up from the winepress.
{18:28} So shall ye also lift up an offering of Jehovah from all your tenths, which ye shall take from the sons of Israel; and ye gave from it the offering of Jehovah to. Aaron the priest.
{18:29} From all your gifts ye shall lift up all the offerings of Jehovah, from all its fat consecrated from it.
{18:30} And say to them, In your offering its fat from it, and it was reckoned to the Levites as the produce of the threshing-floor, and as the produce of the wine-press.
{18:31} And ye ate it in every place, ye and your house; for it is the reward to you for your service in the tent of appointment.
{18:32} And ye shall not bear sin for it in your lifting up its fat from it: and the holy things of the sons of Israel ye shall not defile, and ye shall not die.
{19:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
{19:2} This is the law of the precept which to Jehovah commanded, saying, Speak the sons of Israel and they shall take to thee a red, blameless heifer, to which not a blemish in her, and which a yoke was not lifted up upon her.
{19:3} And give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth without the camp, and slaughter her before him.
{19:4} And Eleazar the priest took from her blood with his finger, and sprinkled before the face of the tent of appointment, from her blood seven times.
{19:5} And he burnt the heifer before his eyes; her skin and her flesh and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn.
{19:6} And the priest took cedar wood and hyssop and double scarlet, and cast into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
{19:7} And the priest washed his garments, and bathed his flesh in water, and afterward he shall go into the camp; and the priest was unclean till evening.
{19:8} And he burning her shall wash his garments in water, and bathed his flesh in water, and was unclean till the evening.
{19:9} And a clean man gathered up the ashes of the heifer, and put without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be to the assembly of the sons of Israel for a preservation for a water of uncleanness: it is sin.
{19:10} And he gathering the ashes of the heifer washed his garments, and was unclean till the evening: and it shall be to the sons of Israel, and to the stranger sojourning in the midst of them, for a law forever.
{19:11} He touching upon the dead of any soul of man and he was unclean seven days.
{19:12} He shall purify himself in the third day, and in the seventh day he shall be clean: and if he shall not be purified in the third day, in the seventh day he shall not be clean.
{19:13} All touching upon the dead, upon the soul of man which shall die, and shall not be purified, defiled the dwelling of Jehovah; and that soul was cut off from Israel: for the water of uncleanness was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness yet upon him.
{19:14} This the law of a man when he shall die in the tent; all going into the tent and all who are in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
{19:15} And every vessel being open which a cord was not bound upon it, it is unclean.
{19:16} And every one who shall touch upon the face of the field, upon the wounded of the sword, or upon the dead, or upon the bone of man, or upon a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
{19:17} And they took for the unclean from the dust of the burning of sin, and living water was given upon it into a vessel:
{19:18} And a clean man took hyssop and dipped in water and sprinkled upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the souls which were there, and upon him touching upon a bone, or upon the wounded, or upon the the dead, or upon a grave:
{19:19} And he being clean sprinkled upon the unclean in the third day, and in the seventh day: and he was cleansed in the seventh day, and he washed his garments and bathed in water, and was clean in the evening.
{19:20} And a man who shall be unclean and shall not be purified, and that soul was cut off from the midst of the gathering, for he defiled the holy place of Jehovah: the water of uncleanness was not sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.
{19:21} And it was to them for a law forever, and he sprinkling the water of uncleanness shall wash his garments; and he touching upon the water of uncleanness shall be unclean till the evening.
{19:22} And all which the unclean shall touch upon it, shall be unclean; and the soul touching shall be unclean till the evening.
{20:1} And the sons of Israel will come, all the assembly, to the desert of Zin, in the first month; and the people will dwell in Kadesh; and Miriam will die there and be buried there.
{20:2} And there was not water for the assembly: and they will gather together against Moses and against Aaron.
{20:3} And they will contend with Moses, and will speak, saying, Would that we died in the dying of our brethren before Jehovah!
{20:4} And for what brought ye the gathering of Jehovah into this desert to die there, we and our cattle.
{20:5} And for what brought ye us up out of Egypt to bring us to this evil place? Not a place of seed, and figs, and the vine and the pomegranate; and not water to drink.
{20:6} And Moses will go, and Aaron, from the face of the gathering to the door of the tent of appointment, and they will fall upon their faces: and the glory of Jehovah shall be seen to them.
{20:7} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{20:8} Take the rod and gather the assembly together, thou and Aaron thy brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes; and it gave water; and brought to them water from the rock, and gave drink to the assembly, and their cattle.
{20:9} And Moses will take the rod from before Jehovah, as he commanded him.
{20:10} And Moses and Aaron will gather together the gathering before the rock, and he will say to them, Hear, now, ye rebellious: from this rock shall we bring forth to you water?
{20:11} And Moses will lift up his hand and will smite the rock with the rod twice, and many waters will come forth, and the assembly will drink and their cattle.
{20:12} And Jehovah will say to Moses, and to Aaron, Because ye believed not in me, to consecrate me before the eyes of the sons of Israel, for this, ye shall not bring in this gathering to the land which I gave to them.
{20:13} These the Waters of Strife, because the sons of Israel strove with Jehovah, and he will be consecrated in them.
{20:14} And Moses will send messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus said thy brother Israel, Thou knewest all the distress which found us:
{20:15} And our fathers will go down to Egypt and will dwell in Egypt many days; and the Egyptians will do evil to us and to our fathers.
{20:16} And we shall cry to Jehovah, and he will hear our voice, and he will send a messenger and he will bring us forth out of Egypt: and behold us in Kadesh, a city the end of thy boundary.
{20:17} Now we will pass over in thy land: we will not pass through in the field and in the vineyard, and we will not drink the water of the well: the way of the king we will go; we will not incline to the right or to the left till we shall pass over thy boundary.
{20:18} And Edom will say to him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest with the sword I shall come out to thy meeting.
{20:19} And the sons of Israel will say to him, By the highway will we come up; and if we shall drink of thy waters, I and my cattle, I gave a price: only not speaking, I will pass through on my feet.
{20:20} And he will say, Thou shalt not pass through. And Edom will come forth to his meeting with a heavy people, and with a strong hand.
{20:21} And Edom will refuse to give to Israel to pass over by his boundary; and Israel will turn away from him.
{20:22} And they will remove from Kadesh, and the sons of Israel, all the assembly will come to Mount Hor.
{20:23} And Jehovah will say to Moses and to Aaron, in mount Hor, upon the boundary of the land of Edom, saying,
{20:24} Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not come into the land which I gave to the sons of Israel, because that ye resisted my mouth at the Waters of Strife.
{20:25} Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to mount Hor.
{20:26} And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered and die there.
{20:27} And Moses will do as Jehovah commanded: and he will bring him up to mount Hor before the eyes of all the assembly.
{20:28} And Moses will strip Aaron of his garments, and will put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron will die there in the head of the mountain: and Moses will come down, and Eleazar, from the mountain.
{20:29} And all the assembly will see that Aaron died, and they will weep for Aaron thirty days, all the house of Israel.
{21:1} And the Canaanite, King Arad, dwelling to the south, will hear that Israel came the way of the places, and he will fight against Israel, and he will carry off from him a captivity.
{21:2} And Israel will vow a vow to Jehovah, and will say, If giving, thou wilt give this people into my hand, and I exterminated their cities.
{21:3} And Jehovah will hear to the voice of Israel, and he will give the Canaanite, and he will exterminate them and their cities: and he will call the name of the place Hormah.
{21:4} And they will remove from mount Hor, the way of the sea of sedge, to encompass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people will be shortened in the way.
{21:5} And the people will speak against God, and against Moses, For what brought ye us up from Egypt to die in the desert? for no bread, and no water; and our soul loathed upon this light bread.
{21:6} And Jehovah will send upon the people deadly serpents, and they will bite the people; and much people will die from Israel.
{21:7} And the people will come to Moses, and they will say, We sinned, for we spake against Jehovah and against thee; wilt thou pray to Jehovah and he will remove the serpent from us? And Moses will pray for the people.
{21:8} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Make to thee a burning, and put it up for a signal: and it was every one being bitten, and he saw it and lived.
{21:9} And Moses will make a brass serpent, and will set it up for a signal, and it was if the serpent bit a man and he looked upon the brass serpent, and he lived.
{21:10} And the sons of Israel will remove, and will encamp in Oboth.
{21:11} And they will remove from Oboth and will encamp in Ije-Abarim, in the desert which is upon the face of Moab, from the rising of the sun.
{21:12} From thence they removed, and they will encamp in the valley of Zared.
{21:13} From thence they removed, and they will encamp from the other side of Amon, which is in the desert coming forth from the boundary of the Amorites: for Arnon is the boundary of Moab, between Moab and between the Amorites.
{21:14} For this it will be said in the book of the wars of Jehovah, Giving in the whirlwind, and the torrents of Arnon.
{21:15} And the outpouring of the torrents which extended to the rest at Ar, and reclined to the boundary of Moab.
{21:16} And from thence the well; it is the well of which Jehovah said to Moses, Gather the people together and I will give to them water.
{21:17} The Israel will sing this song: Ascend thou well! answer ye to it.
{21:18} The leaders dug it, the nobles of the people dug it, by cutting in by their props. And from the desert to Mattanah.
{21:19} And from Mattanah to the Valley of God; and from the Valley of God to Bamoth.
{21:20} And from Bamoth, the valley which is in the field of Moab, the head of Pisgah, and looking upon the face of Jeshimon.
{21:21} And Israel will send messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying,
{21:22} I will pass over in thy land: we will not turn into the field and into the vineyard; we will not drink water of the well; in the way of the king we will go till we shall pass over thy boundary.
{21:23} And Sihon gave not to Israel to pass over by his boundary; and Sihon will gather all his people, and will come forth to meet Israel to the desert: and he will come to Jahaz, and he will fight against Israel.
{21:24} And Israel will smite him with the mouth of the sword, and he will possess his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the sons of Ammon: for the boundary of the sons of Ammon was strong.
{21:25} And Israel will take all these cities: and Israel will dwell in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all her daughters.
{21:26} For Heshbon this the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites; and he fought against the king of Moab, and he will take all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.
{21:27} For this they will say, using parables, Come ye to Heshbon; the city of Sihon shall be built and prepared.
{21:28} For a fire shall come forth from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the heights of Arnon.
{21:29} Wo to thee, Moab! thou wert destroyed, O people of Chemosh: he gave his sons escaping, and his daughters, into captivity to the king of the Amorites, Sihon.
{21:30} And we shall shoot them; Heshbon was destroyed, even to Dibon, and the women even to Nophah, which is to Medeba.
{21:31} And Israel will dwell in the land of the Amorites.
{21:32} And Moses will send to search Jazer, and they will take her daughters, and will drive out the Amorite who is there.
{21:33} And they will turn and go up the way of Bashan: and Og, king of Bashan, will come forth to their meeting, he and all his people, to the war at Edrei.
{21:34} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Thou shalt not be afraid of him; for into thy hand I gave him, and all his people and his land; and do to him as thou didst to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who will dwell in Heshbon.
{21:35} And they will strike him, and his sons, and all his people, until a survivor was not left to him: and they will possess his land.
{22:1} And the sons of Israel will remove and will encamp in the deserts of Moab, from the other side of Jordan at Jericho.
{22:2} And Balak, son of Zippor, will see all that Israel did to the Amorite.
{22:3} And Moab will be afraid from before the people greatly, for they were many; and Moab will feel disgust from the face of the sons of Israel.
{22:4} And Moab will say to the old men of Midian, Now this gathering will lick up all round about us, as the ox licking up the green of the field. And Balak, son of Zippor, the king of Moab in that time.
{22:5} And he will send messengers to Balaam, son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the sons of his people, to call to him, saying, Behold, a people came forth out of Egypt: behold, it covered the eye of the earth, and it dwelt from before me.
{22:6} And now, come now, curse to me this people, for he is strong above me: perhaps I shall be able to strike upon him, and drive him out of the land, for I know whom thou shalt praise is praised, and whom thou shalt curse, shall be cursed.
{22:7} And the old men of Moab and the old men of Midian, will go, and divinations in their hand; and they will come to Balsam, and they will speak to him the words of Balak.
{22:8} And he will say to them, Remain here this night, and I will turn back word to you according as Jehovah will speak to me: and the leaders of Moab will dwell with Balaam.
{22:9} And God will come to Balaam, and will say, What men these with thee?
{22:10} And Balaam will say to God, Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent to me,
{22:11} Behold, the people came forth out of Egypt, and it will cover the eye of the earth: now come curse him to me; perhaps I shall be able to fight against him and I drove him out.
{22:12} And God will say to Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for he is praised.
{22:13} And Balaam will rise in the morning and will say to the leaders of Balak, Go to your land: for Jehovah refused to give me to go with you.
{22:14} And the leaders will rise and go to Balak, and say, Balaam refused to come with us,
{22:15} And Balak will add yet to send leaders, many and honorable, more than these.
{22:16} And they will go to Balaam, and say to him, Thus said Balak, son of Zippor, Now thou wilt not withhold from coming to me:
{22:17} For honoring, I will honor thee greatly, and all which thou shalt say to me I will do; and come, now, curse to me this people.
{22:18} And Balaam will answer, and say to the servants of Balak, If Balak will give to me his house full of silver and gold, I shall not be able to pass over the mouth of Jehovah my God to do little or great.
{22:19} And now, sit ye down, now also in here this night, and I shall know what Jehovah will add to speak with me.
{22:20} And God will come to Balaam at night, and say to him, If the men have come to call to thee, rise up, go with them, and only the word which I shall speak to thee, thou shalt do it.
{22:21} And Balaam will rise up in the morning, and saddle his ass, and go with the leaders of Moab.
{22:22} And the anger of God will kindle because he went; and the messenger of Jehovah will stand in the way, for an adversary to him: and he rode upon his ass, and his two young men with him.
{22:23} And the ass will see the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass will turn from the way and go into the field: and Balaam will strike the ass to turn her in the way.
{22:24} And the messenger of Jehovah will stand in the hollow of the vineyards, an enclosure hence, and an enclosure thence.
{22:25} And the ass will see the messenger of Jehovah and she will press to the wall, and she will press Balaam's foot to the wall; and he will add to strike her,
{22:26} And the messenger of Jehovah will add to pass by and stand in a narrow place where is no way to turn to the right, and to the left.
{22:27} And the ass will see the messenger of Jehovah and she will lie down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger will kindle, and he will strike the ass With a rod.
{22:28} And Jehovah will open the mouth of the ass, and she will say to Balaam, What did I to thee that thou hast smitten me this three beats?
{22:29} And Balaam will say to the ass, Because thou didst vex me: would that a sword was in my hand, for now I had killed thee.
{22:30} And the ass will say to Balaam, Am not I thine ass which thou didst ride upon me ever since thou wert till this day? and being accustomed, was I accustomed to do to thee thus? And he will say, No.
{22:31} And Jehovah will uncover the the eyes of Balsam, and he will see the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand; and he will bow down and worship upon his face.
{22:32} And the messenger of Jehovah will say to him, For what didst thou strike thine ass this three beats? behold, I came forth for an adversary, for the way is perverse before me.
{22:33} And the ass will see me, and will turn before me this three beats: unless she turned from before me for now also I had slain thee, and preserved her alive.
{22:34} And Balaam will say to the messenger of Jehovah, I sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest to meet me in the way; and now if evil in thine eyes, I will turn back to me.
{22:35} And the messenger of Jehovah will say to Balaam, Go with the men: and only the word which I shall speak to thee thou shalt speak it: and Balaam will go with the leaders of Balak.
{22:36} And Balak will hear that Balsam came, and he will go forth to meet him to a city of Moab, which is by the boundary of Arnon, which is m the end of the boundary.
{22:37} And Balak will say to Balaam, Sending, did I not send to thee to call to thee? wherefore camest thou not to me? indeed shall I not be able to honor thee?
{22:38} And Balaam will say to Balak, Behold, I come to thee: being able, shall I be able to speak any thing? the word which Jehovah shall put in my mouth I will speak it.
{22:39} And Balaam will go with Balak and they will come to Kirjath Huzoth.
{22:40} And Balak will sacrifice oxen and sheep, and he will send to Balaam and to the leaders which were with him.
{22:41} And it will be in the morning, and Balak will take Balaam, and will bring him up to the heights of Baal, and he will see from thence the end of the people.
{23:1} And Balaam will say to Balak, Build to me here seven altars, and prepare to me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
{23:2} And Balak will do as Balsam spake, and Balak will bring up, and Balaam, a bullock and a ram upon the altar.
{23:3} And Balsam will say to Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go; perhaps Jehovah will come to my meeting: and the word which he will shew to me I will announce to thee. And he will go to the naked hill.
{23:4} And God will meet Balaam, and he will say to him, I arranged seven altars, and I will bring up a bullock and a ram upon the altar.
{23:5} And Jehovah will put the word in Balaam's mouth, and say, Turn back to Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.
{23:6} And he will turn back to him, and behold, he stood by his burnt-offering, he, and all the leaders of Moab.
{23:7} And he will take up his parable, and say, From Aram, Balak, king of Moab, will transfer me from the mountains of the east; Come curse to me Jacob and come and be angry at Israel.
{23:8} How shall I curse, God cursing not? And how shall I be angry, God not being angry?
{23:9} From the head of the rocks I shall see him, and from the hills I shall look after him: behold, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
{23:10} Who divided out the dust of Jacob and who numbered the fourth of Israel? My soul shall die the death of the just, and my latter state shall be as his.
{23:11} And Balak will say to Balaam, What didst thou to me? To curse mine enemies I took thee, and behold, praising, thou didst praise.
{23:12} And he will answer and say, What Jehovah shall put in my mouth shall I not watch, to speak?
{23:13} And Balak will say to him, Come now with me to another place, where thou shalt see him from thence: thou shalt see only their extremity, and thou shalt not see them all: and curse him to me from thence.
{23:14} And he will take him to the field of Zophim, to the head of Pisgah, and he will build seven altars, and bring up a bullock and a ram upon the altar.
{23:15} And he will say to Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, and I will meet there.

{23:17} And he will come to him, and behold him standing by his burnt-offering, and the leaders of Moab with him. And Balak will say to him, What spake Jehovah?
{23:18} And he will take up his parable, and say, Rise up, Balak, and hear; and give ear to me, son of Zippor:
{23:19} God is not man, and will he lie? and the son of man, and will he grieve? Did he say, and will he not do? and speak, and will he not establish?
{23:20} Behold, I was taken to praise: and he praised and I shall not turn it back.
{23:21} He saw not iniquity in Jacob and he saw not sorrow in Israel: Jehovah his God with him, and the shouts of a king in them.
{23:22} God bringing them out of Egypt; as the swiftness of the buffalo to him.

{23:25} And Balak will say to Balaam, Also, cursing, thou shalt not curse him, also thou shalt not praise him.
{23:26} And Balsam will answer and say to Balak, Spake I not to thee, saying, All which Jehovah shall speak I will do it?
{23:27} And Balak will say to Balaam, Come now, I will take thee to another place; perhaps it will be right in the eyes of God, and curse him to me from thence.
{23:28} And Balak will take Balaam to the head of Peor, projecting upon the face of the desert.
{23:29} And Balsam will say to Balak, Build to me here seven altars, and prepare to me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
{23:30} And Balak will do as Balaam said, and he will bring up a bullock, and a ram, upon the altar.
{24:1} And Balaam will see that it was good in the eyes of Jehovah to praise Israel, and he went not now as before to meet enchantments, and he will set his face to the desert.
{24:2} And Balsam will lift up his eyes and see Israel dwelling according to his tribes; and the spirit of God will be upon him.
{24:3} And he will take up his parable and say, Balaam, the son of Beor, and the man of unclosed eye, said;
{24:4} He said, hearing the sayings of God, who will see the vision of the Almighty, falling, and the eyes being uncovered:
{24:5} How good thy tents, Jacob, and thy dwellings, Israel!
{24:6} As valleys extended, as a garden by the river, as tents Jehovah pitched, as cedars by the waters.
{24:7} He will shake out the water from his bucket, and his seed in many waters, and his king shall be lifted up above Agag, and his kingdom shall be raised up.
{24:8} God brought him forth out of Egypt; as the swiftness of the buffalo to him: he shall cut up the nations his enemies; he shall cut off their strong defenses, and he shall smite through his arrows.
{24:9} He bowed; he lay down as a lion, and as a lioness: who shall raise him up? Praised he praising thee, and cursed he cursing thee.
{24:10} And Balak's anger will kindle against Balaam, and he will strike his hands: and Balak will say to Balaam, To curse mine enemies I called thee, and behold, blessing, thou didst bless this three beats.
{24:11} And now flee for thyself to thy place: I said, Honoring, I will honor thee, and behold, Jehovah withheld thee from honor.
{24:12} And Balaam will say to Balak, Also to thy messengers which thou sentest to me, spake I not, saying,
{24:13} If Balak will give to me his house full of silver and gold, I shall not be able to pass by the mouth of Jehovah, to do good or evil from my heart; what Jehovah shall speak I will speak it.
{24:14} And now, behold me going to my people: come, I will advise thee what this people will do to thy people in the last of the days.
{24:15} And he will take up his parable, and say, Balaam the son of Beor, said, and the man of unclosed eye, said:
{24:16} He said, hearing the sayings of God, honoring the knowledge of the Most High, he will see the vision of the Almighty, falling, and the eyes being uncovered:
{24:17} I shall see him and not now: I shall look after him, and not near: a star came forth from Jacob, and a rod rose up from Israel and dashed in pieces the faces of Moab, and undermined all the sons of Seth.
{24:18} And Edom was an inheritance, and the inheritance of Seir was his enemies; and Israel did in strength.
{24:19} And he shall descend from Jacob, and he destroyed the escaped from the city.
{24:20} And he will see Amalek, and he will take up his parable, and say, Amalek the beginning of the nations, and his latter state he perished forever.
{24:21} And he will see the Kenite, and he will take up his parable, and say, Strong thy dwelling, and put thy nest in the rock.
{24:22} For if Cain shall be for consuming, how long shall Assyria take thee captive?
{24:23} And he will take up his parable, and say, Wo! who shall live, God doing this?
{24:24} And ships from the hand of the Cyprians, and they afflicted Assyria, and they afflicted Heber, and he also perished forever.
{24:25} And Balaam will rise up and will go, and turn back to his place; and also Balak went to his way.
{25:1} And Israel will dwell in Shittim, and the people will begin to commit fornication with the daughters of Moab.
{25:2} And she called the people to the sacrifices of their God: and the people will eat and will worship to their God.
{25:3} And Israel will be bound to Baal-Peor; and the anger of Jehovah will kindle against Israel.
{25:4} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Take all the heads of the people and hang them up to Jehovah before the sun, and the burning anger of Jehovah shall turn back from Israel.
{25:5} And Moses will say to the judges of Israel, Kill ye each his men being bound to Baal-Peor.

{25:7} And Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, will see, and he will rise up from the midst of the assembly and will take a spear in his hand;
{25:8} And he will go after the man of Israel to the tent, and will pierce the two of them, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly: and the smiting will be withheld from the sons of Israel.
{25:9} And they dying in the smiting will be four and twenty thousand.
{25:10} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{25:11} Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, turned back my wrath from the sons of Israel, in his being jealous with my jealousy in the midst of you, and I consumed not the sons of Israel, in my jealousy.
{25:12} For this, say, behold me giving to him my covenant of peace.
{25:13} And it shall be to him and to his seed after him, the covenant of the priesthood forever, because he was jealous for his God; and he shall expiate for the sons of Israel.

{26:1} And it will be after the smiting, And Jehovah will say to Moses, and to Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, saying,

{29:32} And in the seventh day, seven bullocks, two rams, fourteen blameless lambs, sons of a year:
{29:33} And their gift and their libations for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, according to their judgment:
{29:34} And one he goat of sin, besides the burnt-offering of continuance, its gift and its libation:
{29:35} And in the eighth day, a restraint shall be to you: all work of service ye shall not do,
{29:36} And bring ye near a burnt-offering, a sacrifice, an odor of sweetness to Jehovah: one bullock, one ram, seven blameless lambs, sons of a year:
{29:37} Their gift and their libations for the bullock, for the ram, and for the lambs, according to their number, according to judgment:
{29:38} And one he goat of sin, besides the burnt-offering of continuance, and its gift and its libation.
{29:39} These ye shall do to Jehovah in your appointments, besides your vows and your voluntary gifts, for your burnt-offerings, and for your gifts, and your libations, and for your peace.
{29:40} And Moses will say to the sons of Israel according to all which Jehovah commanded Moses.
{30:1} And Moses will speak to the heads of the tribes to the sons of Israel, saying, This the word which Jehovah commanded.
{30:2} A man when he shall vow a vow to Jehovah, or swear an oath to bind a binding upon his soul, he shall not profane his word; according to all going forth from his mouth he shall do.
{30:3} And a woman when she shall vow a vow to Jehovah, and bind a binding in the house of her father, in her youth;
{30:4} And her father heard her vow and her binding which she bound upon her soul, and her father was silent to her; and all her vows stood, and all the binding which she bound upon her soul shall stand.
{30:5} And if her father refused her in the day of his hearing, all her vows and all her bindings which she bound upon her soul, it shall not stand; and Jehovah will forgive her, for her father refused her.
{30:6} And if being she shall be to a husband, and her vows upon her, or the babbling of her lips which she bound upon her soul:
{30:7} And her husband heard in the day of his hearing, and was silent to her: and her vows stood, and the binding which she bound upon her soul shall stand.
{30:8} And if in the day her husband heard he shall refuse her, and he annulled her vows which were upon her, and the babbling of her lips which she bound upon her soul, and Jehovah will forgive her.
{30:9} And the vow of a widow, and of her driven away, all which she bound upon her soul shall stand upon her.
{30:10} And if in the house of her husband she vowed or bound a binding upon her soul with an oath:
{30:11} And her husband heard and was silent to her, he refused her not: and all her vows shall stand, and all the binding which she bound upon her soul shall stand.
{30:12} And if her husband annulling, shall annul them in the day of his hearing; all the going forth of her lips for her vows and for the binding of her soul, shall not stand: her husband annulled them, and Jehovah will forgive her.
{30:13} Every vow, and every oath of binding to afflict the soul, her husband shall cause it to stand, and her husband shall annul it.
{30:14} And if her husband being silent, shall be silent to her from day to day; and he caused to stand all her vows, or, all her bindings which were upon her: he caused them to stand, for he was silent to her in the day of his hearing.
{30:15} And if annulling, he annulled them after his hearing; and he bore the iniquity.
{30:16} These the laws which Jehovah commanded Moses between a man to his wife, between a father to his daughter, in her youth in her father's house.
{31:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{31:2} Avenge the avenging of the sons of Israel of the Midianites: afterwards thou shalt be gathered to thy people.
{31:3} And Moses will speak to the people, saying, Arm from yourselves the men for war, and they shall be against Midian, to give the avenging of Jehovah upon Midian.
{31:4} A thousand to a tribe, a thousand to a tribe, for all the tribes of Israel, ye shall send to war.
{31:5} And there shall be separated from the thousands of Israel a thousand for a tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
{31:6} And Moses will send them a thousand for a tribe, to war, them and Phinehas, son of Eleazar the priest, to war, and the holy vessels, and the trumpets of the signal in his hand.
{31:7} And they will go forth against Midian as Jehovah commanded Moses; and they killed every male.
{31:8} And they killed the kings of Midian upon those being slain: Evi and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: and they killed Balaam, son of Beor, with the sword.
{31:9} And the sons of Israel will take captive the women of Midian and their little ones, and all their cattle, and all their possessions, and they plundered all their strength.
{31:10} And their cities with their dwellings, and all their walls they burnt in fire.
{31:11} And they will take all the plunder and all the spoil, in man and in cattle.
{31:12} And they will bring to Moses and to Eleazar the priest, and to the assembly of the sons of Israel, the captivity and the spoil and the plunder, to the camp to the desert of Moab, which is by Jordan of Jericho.
{31:13} And Moses and Eleazar the priest, and all the chiefs of the assembly will come forth to their meeting without the camp.
{31:14} And Moses will be angry against the officers of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds coming from the war of the battle.
{31:15} And Moses will say to them, Preserved ye alive every female?
{31:16} Behold, they were to the sons of Israel by the word of Balaam for separating treacherously against Jehovah, concerning the word of Peor; and there will be a smiting in the assembly of Jehovah.
{31:17} And now kill every male among the little ones; and every woman know in man by the bed of a male, do ye kill.
{31:18} And all the little ones among the women who knew not the bed of a male, preserve ye alive for yourselves.
{31:19} And encamp ye without the camp seven days: every one killing a soul, and every one touching upon the wounded, ye shall be purified in the third day, and in the seventh day, ye and your captivity.
{31:20} And every garment and every vessel of skin, and every work of goats' hair, and every vessel of wood, ye shall purify.
{31:21} And Eleazar the priest will say to the men of war coming from the battle, This the law of instruction which Jehovah commanded Moses:
{31:22} Only the gold and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
{31:23} Every thing which shall come through fire ye shall make pass through fire, and it was cleansed: only with the water of uncleanness shall it be purified: and all which will not come through the fire ye shall make pass through the water.
{31:24} And wash ye your garments in the seventh day, and be purified, and afterwards ye shall come into the camp.
{31:25} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{31:26} Take the head of the spoil of the captivity, in man and in cattle, thou and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers of the assembly.
{31:27} And divide the spoil between them taking hold of the battle, going forth to war, and between all the assembly:
{31:28} And cast a tribute to Jehovah from the men of the battle going forth to war: one soul from five hundred, from the men and from the oxen, and from the asses, and from the sheep:
{31:29} Ye shall take from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest, an offering of Jehovah.
{31:30} And from the sons of Israel's half thou shalt take one taking from fifty, from the men, from the oxen, from the asses, and from the sheep, from all the cattle, and give them to the Levites watching the watches of the dwelling of Jehovah.
{31:31} And Moses will do, and Eleazar the priest, as the Lord commanded Moses.
{31:32} And the remainder of the spoil plundered which the people of war plundered, will be six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
{31:33} And the oxen two and seventy thousand,
{31:34} And the asses, one and sixty thousand,
{31:35} And the souls of man, from the women which knew not the bed of a male all the souls, two and thirty thousand.
{31:36} And half of the portion of those having gone forth in the war, the Numbers of the sheep will be three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred.
{31:37} And the tribute to Jehovah will be from the sheep, six hundred five and seventy.
{31:38} And the oxen, six and thirty thousand; and their tribute to Jehovah, two and seventy.
{31:39} And the asses thirty thousand and five hundred; and their tribute to Jehovah, one and sixty.
{31:40} And the souls of man, sixteen thousand; and their tribute to Jehovah, two and thirty souls.
{31:41} And Moses will give the tribute, an offering of Jehovah, to Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
{31:42} And from the sons of Israel's half which Moses divided from the men having warred,
{31:43} (And the assembly's half from the sheep, will be three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand five hundred,
{31:44} And the oxen, six and thirty thousand,
{31:45} And the asses, thirty thousand and five hundred,
{31:46} And the souls of man, sixteen thousand;)
{31:47} Moses will take from the sons of Israel's half, one taking from fifty, from man and from cattle, and he will give them to the Levites watching the watches of the tent of Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
{31:48} And there will come near to Moses the officers which are over the thousands of the war, captains of thousands and captains of hundreds:
{31:49} And they will say to Moses, Thy servants took the head of the men of the battle which are in our hand, and a man was not missed from us.
{31:50} And we will bring an offering to Jehovah, what each found, vessels of gold, armbands, and bracelets, rings, ear-rings, and globules of gold, to expiate for our souls before Jehovah.
{31:51} And Moses will take, and Eleazar the priest, all the gold from them, all the vessels of work.
{31:52} And all the gold of the offering which they lifted up to Jehovah, will be sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the captains of thousands and from the captains of hundreds.
{31:53} The men of war plundered each for himself.
{31:54} And Moses will take, and Eleazar the priest, the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and they will bring it to the tent of appointment, a remembrance for the sons of Israel before Jehovah.
{32:1} And much cattle was to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad exceedingly strong: and they will see the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, and behold, the place a place of cattle.
{32:2} And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben will come and will say to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the chiefs of the assembly, saying,
{32:3} Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
{32:4} The land which Jehovah smote before the assembly of Israel, it is a land of cattle, and to thy servants are cattle.
{32:5} And they will say, If we found grace in thine eyes, will this land be given to thy servants for a possession; ye will not cause us to pass over Jordan.
{32:6} And Moses will say to the sons of Gad And to the sons of Reuben, Shall your brethren go forth to battle, and will ye sit here?
{32:7} And wherefore will ye hinder the heart of the sons of Israel from passing over to the land which Jehovah gave to them?
{32:8} So did your fathers in my sending them from Kadesh-Barnea to see the land.
{32:9} And they will go up to the valley of Eshcol, and will see the land, and hinder the heart of the sons of Israel not to go to the land which Jehovah gave to them.
{32:10} And Jehovah's anger will kindle in that day, and he will swear, saying,
{32:11} If the men coming up out of Egypt, from the son of twenty years and above, shall see the land which I sware to Abraham, to Isaak and to Jacob; for they filled not up after me:
{32:12} Except Caleb, son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua, son of Nun: for they filled up after Jehovah.
{32:13} And the anger of Jehovah will kindle against Israel, and he will cause them to wander in the desert forty years, till the finishing of all the generation having done evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
{32:14} And behold, ye rise up instead of your fathers, a growth of men sinners, to add yet to the burning anger of Jehovah to Israel.
{32:15} When ye shall turn back from after him, and he will add yet to leave him in the desert; and ye will destroy all this people.
{32:16} And they will draw near to him, and say, Sheep-folds will we build for our cattle here, and cities for our little ones.
{32:17} And we will arm ourselves, basting on before the sons of Israel, till we brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
{32:18} We will not turn back to our houses till the sons of Israel inherit each his inheritance.
{32:19} For we will not inherit with them from the other side of Jordan and forward; for our inheritance has come to us from this side of Jordan from the risings.
{32:20} And Moses will say to them, If ye will do this word, if ye will arm yourselves before Jehovah for battle,
{32:21} And all to you being armed, pass over Jordan before Jehovah, till his driving out his enemies from his face,
{32:22} And the land subdued before Jehovah: and afterwards ye shall turn back, and be unpunished from Jehovah and from Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Jehovah.
{32:23} And if ye shall not do this, behold, ye sinned to Jehovah: and know ye, your sin which shall find you.
{32:24} Build to you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and ye shall do that coming out of your mouth.
{32:25} And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben will speak to Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commanded.
{32:26} Our little ones, our wives, our possessions, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:
{32:27} And thy servants will pass over, all being armed, to war before Jehovah for battle, as my lord spake.
{32:28} And Moses will command Eleazar the priest, concerning them, and Joshua, the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel:
{32:29} And Moses will say to them, If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben will pass over Jordan with you, all being armed for battle before Jehovah, and the land be subdued before you; and give ye to them the land of Gilead for a possession.
{32:30} And if they will not pass over armed with you, and they possessed in the midst of you in the land of Canaan.
{32:31} And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben will answer, saying, What Jehovah spake to thy servants, so will we do.
{32:32} We will pass over armed before Jehovah to the land of Canaan, and to us shall be the possession of our inheritance from the other side to Jordan.
{32:33} And Moses will give to them, to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan, the land with its cities in the bounds, the cities of the land round about.
{32:34} And the sons of Gad will build Dibon and Ataroth, and Aroer,
{32:35} And Atroth, Shophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,
{32:36} And the house of Nimrah, and the house of Haran, fortified cities: and sheep-folds.
{32:37} And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,
{32:38} And Nebo, and Baal-Meon (the name being changed), and Shibmah: and they will call by names the names of the cities which they built.
{32:39} And the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, will go to Gilead, and take it and drive out the Amorite which is in it.
{32:40} And Moses will give Gilead to Machir, son of Manasseh, and he will dwell in it.
{32:41} And Jair, the son of Manasseh, went, and he will take their villages, and he will call them the villages of Jair.
{32:42} And Nobah went, and he will take Kenath and its houses, and he will call it Nobah in his name.
{33:1} These the departure of the sons of Israel who will go from the land of Egypt according to their army by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
{33:2} And Moses will write their goings out according to their departures by the mouth of Jehovah: and these their departures according to their goings out.
{33:3} And they will remove from Rameses in the first month, in the fifteenth day to the first month: on the morrow of the passover and the sons of Israel went forth with a high hand before the eyes of all the Egyptians.
{33:4} And the Egyptians burying whom Jehovah smote among them, all the first-born: and upon their gods Jehovah did judgments.

{33:50} And Jehovah will speak to Moses in the desert of Moab, by Jordan of Jericho, saying,
{33:51} Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When ye are passing over Jordan to the land of Canaan,
{33:52} And have driven out all those dwelling in the land from before you, and destroy ye all their watch towers, and all their molten images ye shall destroy, and all their heights ye shall lay waste:
{33:53} And dispossess ye the land and dwell in it, for to you, I gave the land to possess it.
{33:54} And divide ye the land by lot to your tribes: to the many ye shall multiply his inheritance, and to the few ye shall diminish his inheritance; to whom shall come forth to him, there shall the lot be to him; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.
{33:55} And if ye shall not drive out those dwelling in the land from before you, and it shall be whom ye shall leave from them for thorns in your eyes, and for prickles in your sides; and they pressed you upon the land which ye shall dwell upon it.
{33:56} And it was as I purposed to do to them I will do to you.
{34:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{34:2} Command the sons of Israel, and say to them, When ye coming into the land of Canaan (this the land which shall fall to you for an inheritance, the land of Canaan with her bounds),
{34:3} And to you was the south side from the desert of Zin upon the hands of Edom, and to you was the south boundary from the extremity of the salt sea eastward.
{34:4} And to you turned the boundary from the south to the ascending of Akrabbim, and it passed over Zin: and its going forth was from the south to Kadesh-Barnea, and it went forth to the Enclosure of the Threshing Floor, and it passed over to Azmon:
{34:5} And the boundary turned from Azmon to the torrent of Egypt, and the goings out were the sea.
{34:6} And the boundary of the sea, and it was to you the great sea; and this shall be the boundary to you, the boundary of the sea.
{34:7} And this shall be to you the north boundary: from the great sea ye shall mark out to you mount Hor.
{34:8} From mount Hor ye shall mark out to you to the going in of Hamath: and the goings out were to Zedad.
{34:9} And the boundary went forth to Ziphron, and the goings out were the Enclosure of Enan: this shall be to you the north boundary.
{34:10} And mark out to you to the east boundary, from the Enclosure of Enan to Shepham.
{34:11} And the boundary went down from Shepham to Riblah, from the east to Ain; and the boundary went down and it struck upon the shoulder of the son of Chinnereth eastward.
{34:12} And the boundary went down to Jordan, and its goings out were to the salt sea. This shall be to you the land according to the boundaries round about.
{34:13} And Moses will command the sons of Israel, saying, This the land which ye shall inherit it by lot, which Jehovah commanded to give to the nine tribes, and the half tribe.
{34:14} For the tribe of the sons of Reuben took according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the sons of Gad according to the house of their fathers, and the half tribe of Manasseh took their inheritance.
{34:15} The two tribes and the half tribe took their inheritance from the other side to Jordan of Jericho eastward from the rising.
{34:16} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{34:17} These the names of the men which shall cause you to inherit the land: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.
{34:18} And one chief, one chief shall ye take from a tribe to cause to inherit the land.
{34:19} And these the names of the men: for the tribe of Judah: Caleb, son of Jephunneh.
{34:20} And for the tribe of the sons of Simeon: Shemuel, son of Ammihud.
{34:21} For the tribe of Benjamin: Elidad, the son of Chislon.
{34:22} And for the tribe of the sons of Dan: chief Bukki, son of Jogli.
{34:23} For the tribe of Joseph, for the tribe of the sons of Manasseh: the chief Hanniel, son of Ephod.

{34:26} And for the tribe of the sons of Issachar: chief Paltiel, son of Azzan.
{34:27} And for the tribe of the sons of Asher: chief Ahihud, son of Shelomi.
{34:28} And for the tribe of the sons of Naphtali: chief Pedahel, son of Ammihud.
{34:29} These whom Jehovah commanded to cause the sons of Israel to inherit in the land of Canaan.
{35:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses in the desert of Moab by Jordan of Jericho, saying,
{35:2} Command the sons of Israel, and they gave to the Levites from the inheritance of their possession, cities to dwell in; and areas to the cities round about them shall ye give to the Levites.
{35:3} And the cities were to them to dwell in; and their areas shall be for their cattle, and for their horses, and for all their beasts.
{35:4} And the areas of the cities which ye shall give to the Levites from the wall of the city and without, a thousand cubits round about.
{35:5} And ye measured from without the city the east side two thousand cubits, and the south side two thousand by the cubit, and the side of the sea two thousand by the cubit, and the north side two thousand by the cubit; and the city in the midst: this shall be to them the areas of the cities.
{35:6} And the cities which ye shall give to the Levites, six cities of refuge, which ye shall give to flee there to the slayer: and upon them ye shall give forty and two.
{35:7} All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites, forty and eight cities: them and their areas.
{35:8} And the cities which ye shall give from the possession of the sons of Israel: from the many ye shall multiply; and from the few ye shall diminish: each according to his inheritance which they shall inherit, he shall give from his cities to the Levites.
{35:9} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{35:10} Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When ye are passing over Jordan to the land of Canaan,
{35:11} And build ye to you cities; cities of refuge shall they be to you; and the slayer to flee there smiting a soul in error.
{35:12} And they to you the cities for refuge from the nearest relative; and the slayer shall not die till his standing before the assembly for judgment,
{35:13} And the cities which ye shall give, six cities of refuge shall be to you.
{35:14} Three cities shall ye give from beyond Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; cities of refuge shall they be.
{35:15} For the sons of Israel and for the stranger, and for the sojourner in the midst of you shall be six cities: these for refuge to flee there all smiting a soul in error.
{35:16} And if with an instrument of iron he smote him, the slayer shall die; the slayer he dying, shall die.
{35:17} And if with a stone of the hand which he shall die by it he smote him, he the slayer shall die; dying, the slayer shall die.
{35:18} Or with an instrument of wood of the hand, which he shall die by it he smote him, he the slayer shall die; dying, the slayer shall die.
{35:19} The nearest relative of blood he shall kill the slayer: in his meeting him he shall kill him.
{35:20} And if in hatred he thrust at him, or cast upon him, or in lying in wait, he shall die.
{35:21} Or in enmity he smote with his hand, and he will die; dying, he smiting shall die; he is a slayer: the nearest relative of blood shall kill the slayer in his meeting him.
{35:22} And if suddenly, not in enmity, he thrust him, or cast upon him any instrument in not lying in wait,
{35:23} Or with any stone which he shall die by it in not seeing, and it will fall upon him and he shall die, and he not an enemy to him and not seeking his hurt:
{35:24} And the assembly judged between him smiting, and between the nearest relation of blood according to these judgments:
{35:25} And the assembly delivered the slayer out of the hand of the nearest relation of blood, and the assembly turned him back to the city of his refuge where he fled there: and he dwelt in it till the death of the great priest who anointed him with the holy oil.
{35:26} And if going out the slayer shall go out of the boundary of the city of his refuge where he shall flee there;
{35:27} And the nearest relation of blood finding him without the boundary of the city of his refuge, and the nearest relation of blood slew the slayer; no blood to him.
{35:28} For in the city of his refuge he shall dwell till the death of the great priest; and after the death of the great priest the slayer shall turn back to the land of his possession.
{35:29} And these were to you for laws of judgment to your generations in all your dwellings.
{35:30} Every one striking a soul by the mouth of witnesses, he shall slay the slayer: and one witness shall not testify against a soul to die.
{35:31} Ye shall not take expiation for the soul of a slayer, he who was guilty to die, for dying, he shall die.
{35:32} And ye shall not take expiation for him fleeing to the city of his refuge, for turning back to dwell in the land till the death of the priest.
{35:33} And ye shall not pollute the land which ye are in it: for blood it will pollute the land: and for the land it will not be expiated for the blood which was poured out upon it but by the blood of him shedding.
{35:34} And thou shalt not defile the land which ye shall dwell upon it, which I dwell in the midst of it: for I Jehovah dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel.
{36:1} And there will come near the heads of the fathers to the families of the sons of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, from the families of the sons of Joseph; and they will speak before Moses and before the chiefs of the heads of the fathers to the sons of Israel.
{36:2} And they will say, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel: and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
{36:3} And they were for wives to one of the sons of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and their inheritance being taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and was added upon the tribe which they shall be to them: and it shall be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.
{36:4} And when the jubilee shall be to the sons of Israel, and their inheritance was added to the inheritance of the tribe which they shall be to them: and from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers their inheritance shall be taken away.
{36:5} And Moses will command the sons of Israel by the mouth of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph are speaking well.
{36:6} This the word which Jehovah commanded to the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, To the good in their eyes they shall be for wives; only to the families of the tribe of their fathers shall they be for wives.
{36:7} And the inheritance of the sons of Israel shall not remove from tribe to tribe; for the sons of Israel shall cleave each to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
{36:8} And every daughter possessing an inheritance from the tribe of the sons of Israel, to one of the families of the tribe of her father shall she be for wife, so that the sons of Israel shall possess each the inheritance of his fathers.
{36:9} And the inheritance shall not remove from a tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the sons of Israel shall cleave each to his inheritance.
{36:10} As Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
{36:11} For Mahlah, Tirzah and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, shall be to the sons of their uncles for wives.
{36:12} To some of the families of the sons of Manasseh, son of Joseph, they were for wives, and their inheritance shall be to the tribe of the families of their fathers.
{36:13} These the commands and the judgments which Jehovah commanded by the hand of Moses to the sons of Israel in the desert of Moab by Jordan of Jericho.
