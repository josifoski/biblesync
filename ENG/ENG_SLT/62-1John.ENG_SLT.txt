{1:1} What was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld, and our own hands felt, concerning the word of life;
{1:2} (And the life was manifested, and we have seen, and we testify, and announce to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)
{1:3} What we have seen and heard we announce to you, that ye also might have communion with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
{1:4} And these we write to you, that your joy might be filled up.
{1:5} And this is the message which we have heard from him, and we announce to you, that God is light, and no darkness is in him.
{1:6} If we say that we have communion with him, and walk in darkness, we are deceived, and do not the truth:
{1:7} But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have communion with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from every sin.
{1:8} If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
{1:9} If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just that he let go sins to us, and cleanse us from all injustice.
{1:10} If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
{2:1} My little children, I write these to you, that ye sin not. And if any sin, we have an intercessor with the Father, Jesus Christ the just:
{2:2} And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
{2:3} And in this we know that we have known him, if we should keep his commands.
{2:4} He saying, I have known him, and not keeping his commands, is a liar, and in him is not the truth.
{2:5} Whoever should keep his word, truly in him has the word of God been completed: in this we know that we are in him.
{2:6} He saying he remains in him ought, as he walked about, so also he to walk about.
{2:7} Brethren, I write no new command to you, but an old command which ye had from the beginning. The old command is the word which ye heard from the beginning.
{2:8} Again, I write a new command to you, which is true in him and in you: for the darkness is passed away, and the true light already shines.
{2:9} He saying he is in the light, and hating his brother, is in the darkness even until now.
{2:10} He loving his brother remains in light, and there is no stumbling-block in him.
{2:11} And he hating his brother is in darkness, and walks about in darkness, and knows not where he goes forward, for darkness has blinded his eyes.
{2:12} I write to you, little children, for your sins are let go for his name.
{2:13} I write to you, fathers, for ye have known him from the beginning. I write to you, young men, for ye have conquered the evil. I write to you, young children, for ye have known the Father.
{2:14} I wrote to you, fathers, for ye have known him from the beginning. I wrote to you, young men, for ye are strong, and the word of God remains in you, and ye have conquered the evil.
{2:15} Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
{2:16} For every thing which in the world, the eager desire of the flesh, and the eager desire of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
{2:17} And the world passes away, and its eager desires: but he doing the will of God remains for ever.
{2:18} Young children, it is the last hour: and as ye have heard that antichrist comes, and now many antichrists have come; whence we know that it is the last hour.
{2:19} They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they had remained with us, but, that they might be manifested, that they are not all of us.
{2:20} And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and know all things.
{2:21} I have not written to you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
{2:22} Who is a liar if not he denying that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, denying the Father and the Son.
{2:23} Every one denying the Son, neither has the Father: he acknowledging the Son, has also the Father.
{2:24} What therefore ye have heard from the beginning, let remain in you. If it remain in you what ye heard from the beginning, ye also shall remain in the Son, and in the Father.
{2:25} And this is the promise which he promised us, eternal life.
{2:26} These I wrote to you concerning them deceiving you.
{2:27} And the anointing which ye received from him remains in you, and ye have no need that any teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is true, and is no lie, and as it taught you, ye shall remain in him.
{2:28} And now, little children, remain in him; that, when he be manifested, we might have freedom of speech, that we be not shamed from him in his presence.
{2:29} If ye know that he is just, ye know that every one doing justice has been born of him.
{3:1} See ye, what kind of love the Father has given us, that we should be called the children of God: for this the world knows us not, for it knew him not.
{3:2} Dearly beloved, now are we the children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we shall be: and we know that, if he be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
{3:3} And every one having this hope in him purifies himself, as he himself is pure.
{3:4} Every one doing sin also does lawlessness; for sin is lawlessness.
{3:5} And ye know that he was manifested that he might let go our sins; and in him is no sin.
{3:6} Every one remaining in him sins not: every one sinning has not seen him, nor known him.
{3:7} Little children, let none deceive you: he doing justice is just, as he is just.
{3:8} He doing sin is of the accuser; for the accuser sins from the beginning. For this was the Son of God manifested, that he might loose the works of the accuser.
{3:9} Every one born of God does not sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, for he has been born of God.
{3:10} In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the accuser: every one not doing justice is not of God, and he not loving his brother.
{3:11} For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
{3:12} Not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And for what slew he him? Because his works were evil, and those of his brother just.
{3:13} Be not amazed, my brethren, if the world hate you.
{3:14} We know that we have passed from death to life, for we love the brethren. He not loving the brother remains in death.
{3:15} Every one hating his brother is a manslayer: and ye know that no manslayer has eternal life remaining in him.
{3:16} In this have we known love, for he set his soul for us: and we ought to set the souls for the brethren.
{3:17} And whoever has the life of the world, and sees his brother having need, and should shut up his bowels from him, how remains the love of God in him?
{3:18} My little children, we should not love in word, neither in tongue; but in work and truth.
{3:19} And in this we know that we are of the truth, and we will yield our hearts before him.
{3:20} For if our heart condemn us, for God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.
{3:21} Dearly beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have freedom of speech towards God.
{3:22} And whatever we ask, we receive of him, for we keep his commands, and do things pleasing before him.
{3:23} And this is his command, That we believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us command.
{3:24} And he keeping his commands remains in him, and he in him. And in this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit he gave us.
{4:1} Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if they are of God: for many false prophets have come out into the world.
{4:2} In this ye know the spirit of God: Every spirit which acknowledges Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is of God:
{4:3} And every spirit which acknowledges not Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that of antichrist which ye have heard comes; and now is already in the world.
{4:4} Ye are of God, little children, and have conquered them: for greater is he in you, than he in the world.
{4:5} They are of the world: for this they speak of the world, and the world hears them.
{4:6} We are of God: he knowing God hears us; he is not of God who hears us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
{4:7} Dearly beloved, we should love one another: for love is of God; and every one loving has been born of God, and knows God.
{4:8} He not loving knows not God; for God is love.
{4:9} In this was the love of God manifested in us, that God has sent his only born Son into the world, that we might live by him.
{4:10} In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins.
{4:11} Dearly beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
{4:12} None has ever seen God. If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is completed in us.
{4:13} In this we know that we remain in him, and he in us, for he has given us of his Spirit.
{4:14} And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his. Son a Saviour of the world.
{4:15} Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God.
{4:16} And we have known and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love; and he remaining in love remains in God, and God in him.
{4:17} In this has love been completed with us, that we might have freedom of speech in the day of judgment: for as he is, so are we in this world.
{4:18} Fear is not in love; but perfected love casts out fear: for fear has restraint. And he fearing has not been perfected in love.
{4:19} We should love him, for he first loved us.
{4:20} If any say, I love God, and hate his brother, he is a liar: for he not loving his brother whom he has seen, God whom he has not seen, how can he love?
{4:21} And this command have we from him, That he loving God love his brother also.
{5:1} Everyone believing that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God: and every one loving him having begotten, loves him also begotten of him.
{5:2} In this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commands.
{5:3} For this is the love of God, that we keep his commands: and his commands are not heavy.
{5:4} For everything begotten of God conquers the world: and this is the victory having conquered the world, our faith.
{5:5} Who is he conquering the world, if not he believing that Jesus is the Son of God?
{5:6} This is he having come by water and blood, Jesus the Christ; not by water alone, but by water and blood. And the Spirit is testifying, for the Spirit is truth.
{5:7} For three are testifying (in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one.
{5:8} And three are testifying in the earth,) the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three are for one.
{5:9} If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater: for this is the testimony of God which he has testified concerning his Son.
{5:10} He believing in the Son of God has the testimony in himself: he not believing God has made him a liar; for he has not believed the testimony which God has testified of his Son.
{5:11} And this is the testimony, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
{5:12} He having the Son has life; and he not having the Son of God has not life.
{5:13} These I wrote to you believing in the name of the Son of God; ye might know that ye have eternal life, and that ye might believe in the name of the Son of God.
{5:14} And this is the freedom of speech which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us:
{5:15} And if we know that he hear us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.
{5:16} If any see his brother sinning a sin not to death, he shall ask, and sinning will give him life to them sinning not to death. There is a sin to death: I say not of that, that he should ask.
{5:17} All injustice is sin: and there is a sin not to death.
{5:18} We know that every one born of God sins not; but he born of God keeps himself, and evil touches him not.
{5:19} We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in evil.
{5:20} And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding, and we know him true, and we are in him true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
{5:21} Little children, watch yourselves from idols. Amen.
