{1:1} And it will be in the days of Ahasuerus, (this Ahasuerus reigned from India and even to Cush; seven and twenty and one hundred provinces:)
{1:2} In those days, when king Ahasuerus sat upon the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the fortress,
{1:3} In the third year to his reign he made a drinking to all his chiefs and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and chiefs of the provinces before him:
{1:4} In his causing to see the riches of the glory of his kingdom, and the honor of his great splendor many days, eighty and one hundred days.
{1:5} And in these days being completed the king made to all the people being found in Shushan the fortress, a drinking to the great and even to the small, seven days, in the enclosure of the garden of the king's house;
{1:6} Splendid fine white linen, and cerulean purple, made fast with cords of byssus and purple, upon rings of silver and pillars of marble: couches of gold and silver upon a tesselated pavement of marble, and marble and pearl and spotted marble.
{1:7} And giving drink in vessels of gold and vessels different from vessels, and wine of the kingdom, an abundance, according to the hand of the king.
{1:8} Giving to drink according to the edict; none compelling, for thus the king appointed to all the multitude of his house to do according to the desire of man and man.
{1:9} Also Vashti the queen made a drinking to the women of the house of the kingdom which was to king Ahasuerus.
{1:10} In the seventh day, as the heart of the king being good with wine, he said to Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs serving the face of king Ahasuerus,
{1:11} To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown of the kingdom, to cause the people and the chiefs to see her beauty: for she was good of appearance.
{1:12} And the queen Vashti will refuse to come in at the word of the king which was by the hand of the eunuchs: and the king will be angry greatly, and his wrath burnt in him.
{1:13} And the king will say to the wise knowing the times, (for thus spake the king before all knowing the edict and judgment:
{1:14} And there drew near to him Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, Memucan, seven chiefs of Persia and Media, seeing the face of the king, sitting the first in the kingdom;)
{1:15} According to the edict what to do against the queen Vashti, for that she did not the word of the king Ahasuerus by the hand of the eunuchs?
{1:16} And Memucan will say before the king, Not against the king alone did Vashti the queen do evil, but against all the chiefs and against all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
{1:17} For the word of the queen will go forth ball the women to cause their husbands to be despised in their eyes, in their saying, The king Ahasuerus said to bring in Vashti the queen before him, and she came not.
{1:18} And this day shall the chief ladies of Persia and Media say, which heard the word of the queen to all the chiefs of the king, and according to contempt and reproach.
{1:19} If good to the king, the word of the kingdom shall go forth from before him, and it shall be written in the edict of the Persians and Medea, and it shall not pass away, that Vashti shall not come before the king Ahasuerus; and the king shall give her kingdom to her companion good above her.
{1:20} And the decree of the king which he shall make being heard in all his kingdom, (for it is great,) and all the women shall give honor to their husbands, to the great and even to the small.
{1:21} And the word will be good in the eyes of the king and the chiefs; and the king will do according to the word of Memucan.
{1:22} And he will send letters to all the provinces of the king, to provinces and provinces, according to its writing, and to people and people, according to their tongue, for every man to be ruling in his house; and being spoken according to the tongue of his people.
{2:1} After these words, as the wrath of the king Ahasuerus was quiet, he remembered Vashti, and what she did, and what was decided against her:
{2:2} And the king's young men will say, those serving him, They shall seek for the king, maidens, virgins good of appearance:
{2:3} And the king shall appoint overseers in all the provinces of his kingdom, and they shall gather together all the maidens, virgins, good of appearance, to Shushan the fortress, to the house of the women, to the hand of Hegai, the king's eunuch, watching the women; giving their purifications:
{2:4} And the maiden who shall be good in the eyes of the king shall reign instead of Vashti. And the word will be good in the eyes of the king; and he will do so.
{2:5} A man, a Jew, was in Shushan the fortress, and his name Mordecai, son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a man, a Benjamite;
{2:6} Who was carried captive from Jerusalem with the captivity which was carried into exile with Jeconiah, king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel carried into exile.
{2:7} And he will be nourishing Hadassah (this is Esther) his uncle's daughter: for not to her, father and mother, and the maiden beautiful of form and good of aspect; and in the death of her father and her mother; Mordecai took her to him for a daughter.
{2:8} And it will be in hearing the word of the king and his edict, and in the gathering together of the many maidens to Shushan the fortress, to the hand of Hegai, and Esther will be taken to the house of the king to the hand of Hegai watching the women.
{2:9} And the maiden will be good in his eyes, and she will receive mercy before him; and he will hasten her purifications, and to give her portion to her, and to give to her seven chosen maidens from the house of the king: and he will change her and her maidens for good to the house of the women.
{2:10} Esther announced not her people and her birth: for Mordecai commanded to her that she shall not announce.
{2:11} And in every day and day, Mordecai going about before the enclosure of the house of the women, to know the peace of Esther, and what will be done with her.
{2:12} And in the coming of the order of maiden and maiden to come in to the king Ahasuerus, from the end of there being to her, according to edict; of women twelve months (for so shall be completed the days of their purifications, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices, and with the purifications of the women;)
{2:13} And thus came the maiden to the king; all which she shall say shall be given to her, to come with her from the house of the women even to the, house of the king.
{2:14} In the evening she came, and in the morning she turned back to the second house of the women, to the hand of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch watching the concubines: she will no more come to the king except the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.
{2:15} And in the coming of the turn of Esther the daughter of Abihail, uncle of Mordecai, which he took to him for a daughter, to go in to the king, she sought not a word except what Hegai the king's eunuch watching the women shall say. And Esther will be taking up favor in the eyes of all seeing her.
{2:16} And Esther will be taken to the king Ahasuerus, to the house of his kingdom, in the tenth month, this the month Tebeth, in the seventh year to his kingdom.
{2:17} And the king will love Esther above all the women, and she will receive favor and mercy before him above all the virgins; and he will set the crown of the kingdom upon her head, and he will cause her to reign instead of Vashti.
{2:18} And the king will make a great drinking to all his chiefs and his servants; Esther's drinking; and he made rest to the provinces, and he will give a lifting up according to the hand of the king.
{2:19} And in the gathering together the virgins the second time, and Mordecai sat in the gate of the king.
{2:20} And Esther not announcing her kindred and her people, as Mordecai commanded to her: and Esther did the saying of Mordecai as when she was in bringing up with him.
{2:21} In those days, and Mordecai sat in the gate of the king, Bigthan was angry, and Teresh, two eunuchs of the king watching the threshold; and they will seek to stretch forth the hand against the king Ahasuerus.
{2:22} And the word will be known to Mordecai, and he will announce to Esther the queen; and Esther will tell to the king in the name of Mordecai.
{2:23} And the word will be sought out and found, and they two will be hung upon a tree: and it will be written in the book of the words of the days before the king.
{3:1} After these words the king Ahasuerus magnified Haman, son of Hammedatha the Agagite; and he will lift him up and set his seat above all the chiefs that were with him.
{3:2} And all the king's servants which were in the king's gate were bowing and worshiping to Haman; for thus the king commanded for him. And Mordecai will not bow, and he will not worship.
{3:3} And the king's servants that were in the king's gate will say to Mordecai, Wherefore dost thou pass by the king's Command?
{3:4} And it will be in their saying to him day and day, and he will not hear to them, and they will announce to Haman to see whether the words of Mordecai will stand: for he announced to them that he was a Jew.
{3:5} And Haman will see that Mordecai bowed not, and not worshiping to him, and Haman will be filled with wrath.
{3:6} And it will be despised in his eyes to stretch forth the hand against Mordecai alone; for they announced to him the people of Mordecai: and Haman will seek to destroy all the Jews which are in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus, the people of Mordecai.
{3:7} In the first month (this the month Nisan,) in the twelfth year to the king Ahasuerus, he cast Pur (this is the lot) before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, this the twelfth the month Adar.
{3:8} And Haman will say to king Ahasuerus, There is one people scattered and dispersed between the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws different from all people; they not doing the laws of the king: and it not being suitable to the king to suffer them.
{3:9} If good to the king, it shall be written to destroy them: and I will weigh ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those doing the work, to bring to the king's treasures.
{3:10} And the king will remove the signet ring from his hand, and will give it to Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, to press the Jews.
{3:11} And the king will say to Haman, The silver is given to thee, and the people, to do with them as is good in thine eyes.
{3:12} And the king's scribes will be called in the first month, in the thirteenth day in it, and it will be written according to all that Haman commanded to the king's satraps and to the prefects, which were over province and province, and to the chiefs of people and people of province and province, according to its writing, and people and people according to their tongue; in the name of king Ahasuerus it was written, and sealed with the king's signet ring.
{3:13} And the letters were sent by the hand of the runners to all the king's provinces, to cut off, to kill and to destroy, all the Jews, from the youth and even to the old man, the little ones and women, in one day, in the thirteenth to the twelfth month, (this the month Adar) and their spoil for plunder.
{3:14} A copy of the writing to be given an edict in every province and province, being manifested to all peoples to be ready for that day.
{3:15} And they running went forth, being impelled by the word of the king, and the edict was given in Shushan the fortress. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; and the city Shushan was disquieted.
{4:1} And Mordecai knew all that was done, and Mordecai will rend his garments, and put on sackcloth and ashes, and he will go forth into the city, and he will cry out a great and bitter cry;
{4:2} And he will come even before the king's gate: for none to come into the king's gate in putting on sackcloth.
{4:3} And in every province and province the place where the word of the king and his edict coming, great mourning to the Jews, and fasting and weeping and wailing; sackcloth and ashes will be spread to many.
{4:4} And Esther's maidens will go in, and her eunuchs, and they will announce to her: and the queen will be greatly grieved; and she will send garments to clothe Mordecai and to put away his sackcloth from off him: and he received not.
{4:5} And Esther will call to Hatach from the king's eunuchs, whom he caused to stand before her, and she will give him a charge to Mordecai, to know what this, and for what this.
{4:6} And Hatach went forth to Mordecai to the broad place of the city, which was before the king's gate.
{4:7} And Mordecai will announce to him all which befell him, and the exposition of the silver which Haman said to weigh to the king's treasures for the Jews to destroy them.
{4:8} And the copy of the writing of the edict which was given in Shushan to destroy them, he gave to him to cause Esther to see, and to announce to her, and to charge upon her to go in to the king to implore mercy, and to seek from before him for her people.
{4:9} And Hatach will go in and announce to Esther the words of Mordecai.
{4:10} And Esther will say to Hatach, and will give him a charge to Mordecai;
{4:11} All the king's servants, and the people of the kings provinces, knowing that every man and woman who shall go in to the king to the inner enclosure who shall not be called, one edict of his to put to death only which the king shall stretch out to him the sceptre of gold, and he lived: and I was not called to go in to the king this thirty days.
{4:12} And they will announce to Mordecai, Esther's words.
{4:13} And Mordecai will tell to turn back to Esther, Thou wilt not imagine in thy soul to escape in the house of the king more than all the Jews.
{4:14} For if being silent, thou shalt be silent in this time, breath and deliverance shall stand up to the Jews from another place; and thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who shall know if for a time like this thou camest to the kingdom?
{4:15} And Esther will tell to turn back to Mordecai:
{4:16} Go collect together all the Jews being found in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and ye shall not eat and ye shall not drink three days, night and day also I and my maidens will fast thus and in this I will go in to the king which is not according to the edict; and according to that I perished, I perished.
{4:17} And Mordecai will pass by, and will do according to all that Esther charged upon him.
{5:1} And it will be in the third day, Esther will put on dominion, and she will stand in the enclosure of the king's house, the interior before the king's house: and the king will sit upon the throne of his kingdom, in the house of the kingdom, before the door of the house.
{5:2} And it will be when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the enclosure, she received favor in his eyes: and the king will stretch out to Esther the sceptre of gold which is in his hand: and Esther will draw near and touch upon the head of the sceptre.
{5:3} And the king will say to her, What to thee, Esther the queen? what thy seeking? even to the half of the kingdom and it shall be given to thee.
{5:4} And Esther will say, If good to the king, will the king come, and Haman, this day, to the drinking which I made for him?
{5:5} And the king will say, Hasten ye Haman to do the word of Esther. And the king will go in, and Haman, to the drinking which Esther made.
{5:6} And the king will say to Esther at the drinking of wine, What thy asking? and it shall be given to thee: and what thy seeking? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be done.
{5:7} And Esther will answer and say, My asking and my seeking:
{5:8} If I found favor in the eyes of the king, and if good to the king to give my asking and to do my seeking, the king shall come and Haman to the drinking that I shall make for them, and to-morrow I will do as the king said.
{5:9} And Haman went forth in that day being glad and good of heart: and when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, and he rose not up and moved not himself for him, and Haman will be filled with wrath against Mordecai.
{5:10} And Haman will contain himself, and will go in to his house; and he will send and cause his friends to come, and Zeresh his wife.
{5:11} And Haman will recount to them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his sons, and all how the king magnified him, and how he lifted him up over the chiefs and servants of the king.
{5:12} And Haman will say also, Esther the queen caused none to come in with the king to the drinking which she made but me; and also to-morrow I am called to her with the king.
{5:13} And all this was not an equivalent to me in all the time which I see Mordecai the Jew sitting in the king's gate.
{5:14} And Zeresh his wife will say to him, and all his friends, Make ye a tree high fifty cubits, and in the morning say thou to the king, and they shall hang Mordecai upon it: and go thou in with the king to the drinking, being glad. And the word will be good before Haman; and he will make the tree.
{6:1} In that night the king's sleep fled away, and he will say to bring in the book of memorials of the words of the days; and they will be read before the king.
{6:2} And it will be found written that Mordecai announced concerning Bigthana and Teresh, the king's two eunuchs watching the threshold, who sought to stretch forth the hand upon the king Ahasuerus.
{6:3} And the king will say, What honor was done and greatness to Mordecai for this? And the young men of the king serving him will say, Not a word was done with him.
{6:4} And the king will say, Who is in the enclosure? And Haman came to the enclosure of the king's house the exterior, to say to the king to hang Mordecai upon the tree which he prepared for him.
{6:5} And the king's young men will say to him, Behold, Haman standing in the enclosure. And the king will say, He shall come in.
{6:6} And Haman will come in. And the king will say to him, What to be done for the man whom the king delighted in his honor? And Haman will say in his heart, To whom will the king delight to do honor more abundantly than me?
{6:7} And Haman will say to the king, The man whom the king delighted in his honor,
{6:8} They shall bring in the clothing of the kingdom which the king was clothed in, it and the horse which the king rode upon him, and the crown of the kingdom which was given upon his head:
{6:9} And giving the clothing and the horse to the hand of a man of the chiefs of the king, the nobles; and clothe the man which the king delighted in his honor, and cause him to ride upon the horse in the broad place of the city, and tall before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighted in his honor.
{6:10} And the king will say to Haman, Hasten; take the clothing and the horse according as thou spakest, and do thus to Mordecai the Jew, sitting in the king's gate: not a word shall fall from all which thou spakest.
{6:11} And Haman will take the clothing and the horse, and he will clothe Mordecai, and cause him to ride in the broad place of the city, and he will call before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighted in his honor.
{6:12} And Mordecai will turn back to the king's gate. And Haman hastened to his house, and the head covered.
{6:13} And Haman will recount to Zeresh his wife, and to all his friends, all which befell him. And his wise men and Zeresh his wife will say to him, If Mordecai be from the seed of the Jews which thou didst begin to fall before him, thou shalt not prevail against him; for falling, thou shalt fall before him.
{6:14} They yet speaking with him, and the king's eunuchs drew near, and they will hasten to bring Haman to the drinking which Esther made.
{7:1} And the king will go in and Haman to drink with Esther the queen.
{7:2} And the king will say to Esther also in the second day at the drinking of wine, What thy asking, queen Esther? and it shall be given to thee: and what thy seeking? even to the half of the kingdom and it shall be done.
{7:3} And Esther the queen will answer and say, If I found grace in thine eyes, O king, and if good to the king, my soul shall be given to me in my asking, and my people in my seeking.
{7:4} For we were sold, I and my people, to cut off, to kill and to destroy. And if for servants and for maids we were sold, I was silent, but the enemy made not even for the loss of the king.
{7:5} And the king Ahasuerus will say, and he will say to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, whom his heart filled him to do thus?
{7:6} And Esther will say, The man, the adversary and enemy, this evil Haman. And Haman was terrified from before the king and the queen.
{7:7} And the king rose up in his wrath from the drinking of wine, to the garden of the palace: and Haman stood up to seek out for his soul from Esther the queen; for he saw that evil was completed for him from the king.
{7:8} And the king turned back from the garden of the palace to the house of the drinking of wine; and Haman fell upon the bed which Esther was upon And the king will say, Also is he to force the queen with me in the house? The word went forth from the king's mouth, and they covered Haman's face.
{7:9} And Harbonah, one of the eunuchs, will say before the king, Also behold the tree which Haman made for Mordecai who spake good for the king, standing in Haman's house, high fifty cubits: And the king will say, Ye shall hang him upon it.
{7:10} And they will hang Haman upon the tree that he preps for Mordecai. And the wrath of the king subsided.
{8:1} In that day the king Ahasuerus gave to Esther the queen, the house of Haman the Jews enemy. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther announced what he was to her.
{8:2} And the king will remove his signet ring which he caused to pass from Haman, and he will give it to Mordecai. And Esther will set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
{8:3} And Esther will add and she will speak before the king, and she will fall before his feet and weep, and make supplication to him to cause the evil of Haman the Agagite to pass away, and his purpose that he purposed against the Jews.
{8:4} And the king will stretch out to Esther the scepter of gold: and Esther will rise and stand before the king,
{8:5} And she will say, If good to the king, and if I found favor before him, and the word be right before the king, and I good in his eyes, it shall be written to turn back the writings, the purposes of Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, that he wrote to destroy the Jews that were in all the king's provinces:
{8:6} For how shall I be able and I looked upon the evil which shall be found with my people? And how shall I be able and I looked upon the destruction of my kindred?
{8:7} And the king Ahasuerus will say to Esther the queen, and to Mordecai the Jew, The house of Haman I gave to Esther, and they hung him upon the tree because he stretched forth his hand against the Jews.
{8:8} And write ye for the Jews as is good in your eyes, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's signet ring: for the writing which was written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's signet ring, none to turn back.
{8:9} And the king's scribes will be called in that time in the third month, (this the month Sivan) in the three and twentieth in it; and it will be written according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, and to the satraps, and the prefects, and the chiefs of the provinces which are from India and even to Cush, seven and twenty and a hundred provinces, province and province according to its writing, and people and people according to their tongue, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their tongue.
{8:10} And he will write in the name of the king Ahasuerus, and seal with the king's signet ring; and he will send letters by the hand of runners on horses riding the courser, the mules, sons of mares:
{8:11} Which the king gave to the Jews which were in every city and city to gather together, and to stand for their soul, to cut off, and to kill and to destroy all the power of the people and province pressing upon them, little ones and women, and their spoil for booty,
{8:12} In one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, in the thirteenth to the twelfth month, this the month Adar.
{8:13} The copy of the writing to be given an edict in every province and province, revealed to all the peoples, and for the Jews to be ready for this day to avenge themselves of their enemies.
{8:14} The runners riding the courser, the mules, went forth, being hastened and impelled by the word of the king. And the edict was given in Shushan the fortress.
{8:15} And Mordecai went forth from before the king in clothing of the kingdom, cerulean purple, and white, and a great crown of gold, and a wide robe of byssus and purple: and the city Shushan shouted and was glad:
{8:16} There was to the Jews light and gladness and joy and honor.
{8:17} And in every province and province, and in every city and city, the place where the word of the king and his edict coming, gladness and joy to the Jews, a drinking and a good day. And many peoples of the land becoming Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.
{9:1} And in the twelfth month (this the month Adar) in the thirteenth day in it, when the word of the king drew near, and his edict to do in the day that the enemies of the Jews expected to have power over them, (and it was turned that these Jews will have power over those hating them:)
{9:2} The Jews were gathered together in their cities in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to stretch forth the hand upon those seeking their evil: and a man stood not before them, for their fear fell upon all the peoples.
{9:3} And all the chiefs of the provinces, and the satraps, and the prefects, and those doing the work that was for the king, were lifting up with the Jews; for the fear of Mordecai fell upon them:
{9:4} For great was Mordecai in the house of the king, and his fame went into all the provinces: for the man Mordecai went and was magnified.
{9:5} And the Jews will strike against all their enemies with the blow of the sword, and killing and destruction; and they will do according to their desire upon those hating them.
{9:6} And in Shushan the fortress the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
{9:7} Parshandatha and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
{9:8} And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
{9:9} And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,
{9:10} The ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the Jews enemy, they slew; and upon the prey they stretched not out their hand.
{9:11} In that day came the number of those slain in Shushan the fortress before the king.
{9:12} And the king will say to Esther the queen, In Shushan the fortress the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men, and the ten sons of Haman: in the rest of the king's provinces what did they? and what thy asking? and it shall be given to thee: and what more thy seeking? and it shall be done.
{9:13} And Esther will say, If good to the king, it shall be given also to-morrow to the Jews that are in Shusan to do according to the edict of the day, and they shall hang Haman's ten sons upon the tree.
{9:14} And the king will say to do this. And the edict will be given in Shushan; and they hung the ten sons of Haman.
{9:15} For the Jews that were in Shushan will gather together also in the fourteenth day to the month Adar, and they will kill in Shushan three hundred men; and upon the prey they sent not the hand.
{9:16} And the rest of the Jews which were in the king's provinces gathered together and stood for their soul, and rested from their enemies, and slew among their enemies five and seventy thousand; and upon the prey they sent not their hand.
{9:17} In the thirteenth day to the month Adar, and resting in the fourteenth in it, and making it a day of drinking and gladness.
{9:18} And the Jews that were in Shushan were assembled in the thirteenth in it, and in the fourteenth in it; and resting in the fifteenth in it, and making it a day of drinking and gladness.
{9:19} For this the Jews of the villages and in cities of the open country making the fourteenth day to the month Adar, gladness and drinking, and a good day, and sending portions a man to his neighbor.
{9:20} And Mordecai will write these words, and send letters to all the Jews that were in all the king Ahasuerus's provinces, near and far off,
{9:21} To set up to them to be doing the fourteenth day to the month Adar, and the fifteenth day in it, in every year and year,
{9:22} As the days which the Jews rested in them from their enemies, and the month that was turned to them from grief to gladness, and from mourning to a good day, to make them days of drinking and gladness, and sending portions a man to his neighbor, and gifts to the needy.
{9:23} And the Jews admitting what they began to do, and what Mordecai wrote to them.
{9:24} For Haman son of Hammedatha the Amite, oppressing all the Jews, purposed against the Jews to destroy them, and he cast Pur (this the lot) to discomfit them and to destroy them;
{9:25} And in her coming before the king, he said by letter he will turn back his purpose of evil that he purposed against the Jews upon his head: and they hung him and his sons upon the tree.
{9:26} For this they called to these days Purim, for the name of Pur. For this upon all the words of this epistle, and What they saw upon this, and what came to them,
{9:27} The Jews set up and admitted upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all joining themselves to them, and they shall not pass by to be doing these two days according to their writing, and according to their time in every year and year;
{9:28} And these days being remembered and done in every generation and generation, family and family, province and province, city and city; and these days of the lots shall not pass by from the midst of the Jews, and their remembrance shall not be ended from their seed.
{9:29} And Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, will write with all power to set up the epistle of Purim, this second.
{9:30} And he will send the letter to all the Jews, to the seventy and twenty and a hundred provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, words of peace and truth,
{9:31} To set up these days of Purim in their times, as Mordecai the Jew set up to them, and Esther the queen, and as they set up for their souls and for their seed, the words of fastings and their cry:
{9:32} And the saying of Esther set up these words of Purim; and it was written in the book.
{10:1} And the king Ahasuerus will set up a tribute upon the land, and the isles of the sea.
{10:2} And all the work of his power and his strength, and the exposition of the greatness of Mordecai which the king magnified him, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Media and Persia?
{10:3} For Mordecai the Jew was second to the king Ahasuerus, and great to the Jews, and acceptable to the multitude of his brethren, seeking good for his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.
