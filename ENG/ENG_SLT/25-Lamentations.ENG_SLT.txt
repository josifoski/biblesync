{1:1} How sat the city alone being many in people she was as a widow: being many among the nations, being a leader in the provinces, she became for tribute.
{1:2} Weeping, she will weep in the night, and her tears upon her cheeks: no comfort to her from all loving her: all her friends dealt faithlessly with her, they were to her for enemies.
{1:3} Judah was carried away captive from affliction, and from the greatness of her serving: she dwelt in the nations, she found no rest: all pursuing her overtook her between straitnesses.
{1:4} The ways of Zion mourn from none coming to the appointment: all her gates being desolated: her priests groaning, her virgins grieved, and it is bitterness to her.
{1:5} Her adversaries were for head, her enemies were secure; for Jehovah afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children went into captivity before the face of him pressing.
{1:6} From the daughter of Zion all her decoration went forth: her chiefs were as rams; they found not feed, and they went without strength before him pursuing.
{1:7} Jerusalem remembered the days of her affliction and her wanderings, all her delights which were from the days of old in the falling of her people into the hand of the enemy, and none helping for her: the adversaries saw her; they laughed at her calamities.
{1:8} Jerusalem sinned a sin; for this she was for a removing: all honoring her despised her, for they saw her nakedness: also she sighed, and she will turn away behind.
{1:9} Her uncleanness is in her train; she remembered not her latter state; and she will come down wonderfully: none comforting for her. See, O Jehovah, my affliction: for the enemy magnified.
{1:10} The adversary spread out his hand upon all her delights, for she saw the nations came in to her holy place, which thou didst command they shall not come in to the convocation to thee.
{1:11} All her people sighing, seeking bread; they gave from their delights for food to turn back the soul: see, O Jehovah, and regard; for I was despised.
{1:12} Nothing to you, all ye passing by the way? Behold, and see if there is pain as my pain, which was done to me with which Jehovah afflicted in the day of the burning of his anger.
{1:13} From height he sent fire into my bones, and it brought them down: he spread a net for my feet, he turned me away behind: he gave me desolation, being sad all the day.
{1:14} The yoke of my transgressions was bound by his hand: they will be woven together, they came up upon my neck: he caused my strength to fail, Jehovah gave me into the hands; I shall not be able to rise up.
{1:15} Jehovah contemned all my mighty ones in my midst: he called an appointment upon me to break my chosen ones: Jehovah trod the wine-press to the virgin, the daughter of Judah.
{1:16} For these I weep; mine eye, mine eye will go down with water, for he comforting turning back my soul, removed far off from me: my sons were desolations, for the enemy prevailed.
{1:17} Zion spread forth her hands, none comforting for her: Jehovah commanded for Jacob, his adversaries round about him: Jerusalem was for uncleanness within them.
{1:18} Jehovah he is just: for I embittered his mouth: hear now, all ye peoples, and see my pain: my virgins and my chosen ones went into captivity.
{1:19} I called to those loving me, they deceived me: my priests and my old men expired in the city, for they sought food for them, and they will turn back their souls.
{1:20} See, O Jehovah; for straits to me: my bowels were in a ferment; my heart turned in my midst; for embittering, I embittered: without, the sword bereaved; in the house, as death.
{1:21} Hear, ye, for I groan: none comforting for me: all mine enemies heard my evils: they rejoiced that thou didst: thou broughtest the day thou didst call, and they shall be like me.
{1:22} All their evil shall come before thee; and do evil to them according as thou didst evil to me for all my transgressions: for many my groanings, and any heart being sad.
{2:1} How will Jehovah in his anger cover the daughter of Zion! he cast down from the heavens to the earth the beauty of Israel, and he remembered not the footstool of his feet in the day of his anger.
{2:2} Jehovah swallowed up, not pitying, all the seats of Jacob: he pulled down in his wrath the fortresses of the daughter of Judah; he caused to touch to the earth: he defiled the kingdom and her chiefs.
{2:3} He cut off in the burning of anger all the horn of Israel: he turned back his right hand from the face of the enemy, and he will consume against Jacob as a fire of flame devouring round about.
{2:4} He bent his bow as an enemy: he set his right hand as an adversary, and be will slay all the delights of the eye in the tent of the daughter of Zion: he poured his wrath as fire.
{2:5} Jehovah was as an enemy: he swallowed up Israel, he swallowed up all her fortresses: he destroyed his fortifications, and he will multiply in the daughter of Judah sorrow and sighing.
{2:6} And he will tear away as a garden his dwelling: he destroyed his appointment: Jehovah caused to forget the appointment in Zion, and the Sabbath, and he will despise in the wrath of his anger the king and the priest.
{2:7} Jehovah rejected his altar, he abhorred his holy place, he shut up in the hand of the enemy the walls of her castles; they gave a voice in the house of Jehovah, as the day of the appointment.
{2:8} Jehovah purposed to destroy the walls of the daughter of Zion: he stretched out a line, he turned not back his hand from swallowing down: and the entrenchment will mourn, and the wall; together they languished.
{2:9} Her gates sank into the earth; he destroyed and broke her bars: her king and her chiefs among the nations: no law: also her prophets found not a vision from Jehovah.
{2:10} They sat upon the earth; the old men of the daughter of Zion were silent; they brought up the dust upon their head: they girded on sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem brought down their head to the earth.
{2:11} Mine eyes failed with tears, my bowels were in a ferment, my liver was poured out to the earth, upon the breaking of the daughter of my people; in the fainting of the child and suckling in the wide places of the city.
{2:12} To their mothers will they say, Where the grain and wine? in their languishing as the wounded in the broad places of the city, in the pouring out of their soul into their mothers bosom.
{2:13} What shall I testify for thee? What shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare to thee, and comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for great as the sea thy breaking: who shall heal for thee?
{2:14} Thy prophets saw for thee vanity and a foolish thing, and they uncovered not upon thine iniquity to turn back thy captivity; and they will see for thee burdens of falsehood and seductions.
{2:15} All passing by the way clapped their hands at thee; they hissed, and they will nod their head at the daughter of Jerusalem: This the city, they will say; the complete splendor of joy to all the earth.
{2:16} All thine enemies opened wide their mouth upon thee: they hissed and they will gnash the teeth: they said, We swallowed down: surely this the day we longed for; we found; we saw.
{2:17} Jehovah did what he purposed; he completed his word which he commanded in days of old: he pulled down and he pitied not: and be will gladden the enemy over thee; he lifted up the horn of thine adversaries.
{2:18} Their heart cried to Jehovah, O wall of the daughter of Zion, cause tears to go down as a torrent day and night thou shalt give no remission to thyself; the daughter of thine eye shall not be silent.
{2:19} Arise, cry aloud in the night: at the head of the watches pour out thy heart as water before the face of Jehovah: lift up thy hands to him for the soul of thy young children fainting with hunger in the head of all the streets.
{2:20} See, O Jehovah, and look to whom thou didst accomplish this Shall the women eat their fruit, the children borne upon the hands? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the holy place of Jehovah?
{2:21} The youth and old man lay down upon the earth of the streets; my virgins and my young men fell by the sword; thou didst slay in the day of thine anger; thou didst slay, thou didst not pity.
{2:22} Thou wilt call as the day of appointment my sojourning from round about, and in the day of the anger of Jehovah there was no escaping and surviving: those I bore upon my hands and brought up, the enemy finished.
{3:1} I the man seeing affliction by the rod of his wrath.
{3:2} He led me and he brought darkness and not light.
{3:3} Surely he will turn back against me; he will turn his hand all the day.
{3:4} He wasted away my flesh and my skin; he broke my bones.
{3:5} He built against me, and he will surround with poison and distress.
{3:6} He caused me to dwell in darknesses as the dead of old.
{3:7} He walled about me and I shall not go forth: he loaded my brass.
{3:8} Also when I shall exclaim and cry out, he stopped my prayer.
{3:9} He walled up my ways with hewn stones, he made crooked my beaten paths.
{3:10} He is to me a bear lying in wait, a lion in secret places.
{3:11} He turned aside my ways and he will tear me in pieces: he set me a desolation.
{3:12} He bent his bow, he will set me up as a mark for the arrow.
{3:13} He brought the sons of his quiver into my reins.
{3:14} I was a derision to all my people; their song all the day.
{3:15} He filled me with bitternesses, he gave me wormwood to drink.
{3:16} He will break my teeth with gravel stones, he covered me with ashes.
{3:17} Thou wilt cast of my soul from peace: I forgat good.
{3:18} And saying, My glory perished, and my hope from Jehovah:
{3:19} Remembering my affliction and my bitterness, the wormwood and the poison.
{3:20} Remembering, my soul will remember, and will be bowed down upon me.
{3:21} I will turn this back to my heart; for this I shall hope.
{3:22} The mercies of Jehovah are that we were not consumed, for his compassions were not finished.
{3:23} New for the mornings: great thy faithfulness.
{3:24} Jehovah my portion, said my soul; for this I will hope toward him.
{3:25} Good Jehovah to those waiting for him, to the soul that will seek him.
{3:26} Good, and he shall wait and stand still for the salvation of Jehovah.
{3:27} Good for a man that he shall lift up the yoke in his youth.
{3:28} He will sit alone and be silent, for he laid upon him.
{3:29} He will give his mouth in the dust, if perhaps there is hope.
{3:30} He will give the cheek to him striking him: he will be filled with reproach.
{3:31} For Jehovah will not cast of forever:
{3:32} For if he afflicted, and he compassionated according to the multitude of his mercy.
{3:33} For he afflicted not from his heart and grieved the sons of men,
{3:34} To crush under his feet all the bound of the earth,
{3:35} To turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the Most High.
{3:36} To pervert a man in his contention Jehovah saw not.
{3:37} Who this saying, And it shall be Jehovah commanding not?
{3:38} From the mouth of the Most High shall not come forth evil and good.
{3:39} Why shall a living man murmur? a man for his sin?
{3:40} We will search out our ways, and examine and turn back even to Jehovah.
{3:41} We will lift up our hearts upon the hands to God in the heavens.
{3:42} We transgressed and resisted: thou forgavest not.
{3:43} Thou didst cover with anger, and thou wilt pursue us: thou didst slay, thou didst not pity.
{3:44} Thou didst cover over thyself with a cloud from a prayer passing through.
{3:45} Thou didst set us the offscouring and despising in the midst of peoples.
{3:46} All our enemies opened their mouth against us.
{3:47} Fear and a snare were to us, desolation and breaking.
{3:48} Mine eye will bring down streams of water for the breaking of the daughter of my people.
{3:49} Mine eye flowed and it will not be silent, from no intermission,
{3:50} Till Jehovah shall look forth and see from the heavens.
{3:51} Mine eye will glean for my soul for all the daughters of my city.
{3:52} Hunting, they hunted me as a bird, mine enemies, gratuitously.
{3:53} They cut off my life in the pit, and cast a stone upon me.
{3:54} Waters were spread over my head; I said I was cut off.
{3:55} I called thy name, O Jehovah, in the pit underneath.
{3:56} Thou heardest my voice: thou wilt not hide thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
{3:57} Thou drewest near in the day I shall call thee: thou saidst, Thou shalt not fear.
{3:58} Thou didst contend, O Jehovah, the contentions of my soul; thou didst redeem my life.
{3:59} Thou sawest, O Jehovah, my bowing down: judge thou my judgment.
{3:60} Thou sawest all their vengeance, all their purposes against me.
{3:61} Thou heardest their reproach, O Jehovah, all their purposes against me.
{3:62} The lips of those rising up, and their devices against me all the day.
{3:63} Their sitting and their rising, look thou: I their song.
{3:64} Thou wilt turn back to them a retribution, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.
{3:65} Thou wilt give to them a covering of heart, thy curse to them.
{3:66} Thou wilt pursue in thine anger, and thou wilt destroy them from under the heavens, O Jehovah.
{4:1} How will the gold become dim the good gold will be changed the stones of the holy place shall be poured out in the head of all the streets.
{4:2} The precious sons of Zion being lifted up with fine gold, how they were reckoned for earthen vessels, the work of the hands of the potter.
{4:3} Also the dragons draw out the breast, they suckled their sucklings: the daughter of my people violent as the ostriches in the desert.
{4:4} The tongue of the suckling adhered to his palate in thirst: the young children asked for bread, none breaking bread to them.
{4:5} They eating for dainties were desolate in the streets: they trusting upon scarlet embraced dung hills.
{4:6} For the iniquity of the daughter of my people will be great above the sin of Sodom being overthrown as in a moment, and no hands waited for her.
{4:7} Her consecrated ones were pure above snow, they were white above milk, they were red of body above pearls, their figure sapphire:
{4:8} Their form dark above blackness; they were not known in the streets: their skin adhered to their bones; it was dried up, it was as wood.
{4:9} Those wounded by the sword were good above those wounded by famine: these will flow away, being thrust through from the produce of the field.
{4:10} The hands of compassionate women boiled their children: they were for food to them in the breaking of the daughter of my people.
{4:11} Jehovah finished his wrath; he poured out the burning of his anger, and he kindled a fire in Zion, and it will devour her foundations.
{4:12} The kings of the earth believed not, and all those dwelling in the habitable globe, that the enemy will come in to the gates of Jerusalem.
{4:13} From the sins of her prophets the iniquities of her priests shedding the blood of the just in her midst,
{4:14} The blind were shaken in the streets, they were stained with blood, so that they shall not be able to touch upon their garments.
{4:15} Remove the unclean one, call to them; remove, remove, ye shall not touch: for they were laid waste; they were shaken, say ye, among the nations: they shall not add to sojourn.
{4:16} The face of Jehovah their portion; he will not add to look upon them: they accepted not the face of the priests, they compassionated not the old men.
{4:17} Continuing, yet our eyes will fail, for our help in vain: in our watching we watched for a nation it will not save us.
{4:18} They hunted our steps from going in our broad places: our end drew near, our days were completed; for our end came.
{4:19} They pursuing us were swift above the eagle of the heavens: they burned after us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the desert.
{4:20} The spirit of our nostrils, the Messiah of Jehovah was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.
{4:21} Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, dwelling in the land of Uz; also upon thee shall the cup pass: thou shalt be drunken, and make thyself naked.
{4:22} Thine iniquity was finished, O daughter of Zion; he will not add to carry thee into exile: reviewing thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he uncovered upon thy sins.
{5:1} Remember, O Jehovah, what was to us: look and see our reproach.
{5:2} Our inheritance was turned to strangers, our houses to foreigners.
{5:3} We were orphans, no father; our mothers as widows.
{5:4} We drank our water for silver; our wood will come for a price.
{5:5} Upon our necks were we pursued: we labored and no rest to us.
{5:6} We gave the hand to Egypt, to Assur, to be filled with bread.
{5:7} Our fathers sinned, they are not; we bore their iniquities.
{5:8} Servants ruled over us: none delivering from their hand.
{5:9} With our souls we shall bring our bread from the face of the sword of the desert.
{5:10} Our skin was scorched as a furnace from the face of the violent heat of famine.
{5:11} They humbled the women in Zion the virgins in the cities of Judah.
{5:12} Chiefs were hung by their hand: the faces of old men were not honored.
{5:13} They took away the chosen ones to grind, and the young men were weak in the wood.
{5:14} Old men ceased from the gate, the chosen ones from their stringed instruments.
{5:15} The joy of our heart ceased; our dance was turned to mourning.
{5:16} The crown of our head fell: wo! now to us, for we sinned.
{5:17} For this our heart was languid; for this our eyes were darkened.
{5:18} For mount Zion was laid waste, the foxes went upon it.
{5:19} Thou, O Jehovah, shalt dwell forever; thy throne to generation and generation.
{5:20} Wherefore wilt thou forget us forever? wilt thou forsake us to length of days?
{5:21} Turn us back, O Jehovah, to thee, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.
{5:22} But rejecting, thou didst reject us; thou wert angry against us even greatly.
