{1:1} Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel;
{1:2} To know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;
{1:3} To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice and judgment, and uprightness;
{1:4} To give craftiness to the simple, and to the youth, knowledge and meditation.
{1:5} The wise one will hear and he will add learning: and he understanding, shall obtain guidance:
{1:6} To understand a proverb, and an enigma: the words of the wise and their parables.
{1:7} The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge: the foolish despised wisdom and instruction.
{1:8} My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and thou shalt not reject the law of thy mother:
{1:9} For they a garland of grace to thy head, and necklaces for thy throat.
{1:10} My son, if they sinning shall entice thee, thou shalt not go in.
{1:11} If they shall say, Go with us, we will lie in wait for blood, we will hide for the innocent gratuitously;
{1:12} We will swallow them down living, as hades, and whole, as they going down to the pit:
{1:13} We shall find precious riches, we will fill our houses with spoil:
{1:14} Wilt thou cast thy lot in the midst of us; one purse shall be to all:
{1:15} My son, thou shalt not go in the way with them; withhold thy foot from their beaten paths:
{1:16} For their feet will run to evil, and they will hasten to pour out blood:
{1:17} For gratuitously the net was spread in the eyes of all possessing a wing.
{1:18} And they will lie in wait for their blood; they will hide for their souls.
{1:19} So the ways of every one plundering plunder; he will take the soul of those possessing it.
{1:20} Wisdom will cry without; in the broad places she will give her voice:
{1:21} She will call in the head of sound, in the entrances of the gates: in the city she will say her words:
{1:22} How long, ye simple, will ye love simplicity? and mockers delight to mock for them, and the foolish hate knowledge?
{1:23} Ye shall turn back at my reproofs: behold, I will pour forth my spirit to you, I will make known my words to you.
{1:24} Because I called and ye will refuse; I stretched forth my hands, and none attending;
{1:25} And ye will reject all my counsels, and ye desired not my reproofs:
{1:26} Also I will laugh at your ruin: I will deride in the coming of your terror;
{1:27} In your terror coming as a destroying tempest, and your ruin shall come as a whirlwind; in the coming upon you of straits and distress.
{1:28} Then they shall call upon me, and I will not answer; they shall seek me, and shall not find me;
{1:29} For that they hated knowledge, and chose not the fear of Jehovah:
{1:30} They desired not for my counsels: and derided all my reproofs.
{1:31} And they shall eat from the fruit of their way, and be filled with their purposes.
{1:32} For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the error of the foolish shall destroy them.
{1:33} And he hearing to me shall dwell in confidence, and being quiet from fear of evil.
{2:1} My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and wilt hide my commands with thee;
{2:2} To attend to wisdom thou wilt incline thine ear, thy heart to understanding;
{2:3} For if thou will call to understanding, wilt give thy voice to understanding.
{2:4} If thou wilt seek her as silver, and dig for her as hidden treasure;
{2:5} Then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, and thou shalt find the knowledge of God.
{2:6} For Jehovah will give wisdom: from his mouth knowledge and understanding.
{2:7} He treasured up deliverance for the upright: a shield to those going in uprightness:
{2:8} To guard the paths of judgment, and he will watch the way of his godly ones.
{2:9} Then thou shalt understand justice and judgment and uprightness; every good track.
{2:10} For wisdom shall come into thy heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant to thy soul.
{2:11} Meditation shall watch over thee, understanding shall guard thee:
{2:12} To deliver thee from the evil way, from the man speaking deceit;
{2:13} Those forsaking the paths of straightness to go in the ways of darkness;
{2:14} Those rejoicing to do evil will exult in the deceit of evil;
{2:15} Whose paths are perverted, and in their tracks are bent aside:
{2:16} To deliver thee from the strange woman, from the stranger making smooth her sayings;
{2:17} Forsaking the friend of her youth, and forgetting the covenant of her God.
{2:18} For her house sunk down to death, and her tracks to the shades.
{2:19} All going in it shall not turn back, and they shall not overtake the paths of life.
{2:20} So that thou shalt go in the way of the good, and thou shalt watch the paths of the just.
{2:21} For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the blameless shall remain in it.
{2:22} And the unjust shall be cut off from the land, and they transgressing shall be wiped off from it.
{3:1} My son, thou shalt not forget my law, and thy heart shall guard my commands:
{3:2} For length of days and years of life, and peace they shall add to thee.
{3:3} Mercy and truth shall not forsake thee: bind them upon thy throat; write them upon the tablet of thy heart:
{3:4} And find grace and good understanding in the eyes of God and man.
{3:5} Trust to Jehovah with all thy heart; and thou shalt not lean to thine understanding.
{3:6} In all thy ways know him, and he will make straight thy paths.
{3:7} Thou shalt not be wise in thine eyes: fear Jehovah and depart from evil.
{3:8} It shall be healing to thy sinews, and moistening to thy bones.
{3:9} Honor Jehovah from thy substance, and from the first-fruits of all thy produce.
{3:10} And thy storehouses shall be filled with abundance, and thy wine-vats shall break forth with new wine.
{3:11} My son, thou shalt not reject the instruction of Jehovah, and thou shalt not loathe upon his reproofs:
{3:12} For whom Jehovah shall love he will rebuke, as a father the son he will delight in.
{3:13} Happy the man finding wisdom; and the man shall bring forth understanding.
{3:14} For good her gain above the gain of silver, and her increase above gold.
{3:15} She is precious above red corals: and all thy delights shall not be equal with her.
{3:16} Length of days in her right hand; in her left, riches and honor.
{3:17} Her ways the ways of pleasantness, and all her beaten paths, peace.
{3:18} She is a tree of life to all holding upon her: and happy he holding her fast.
{3:19} Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; he prepared the heavens by understanding.
{3:20} By his knowledge the depths were rent, and the clouds will drop dew.
{3:21} My son, they shall not depart from thine eyes: keep counsel and meditation:
{3:22} And they shall be life to thy soul, and grace to thy throat.
{3:23} Then shalt thou go thy way confidently, and thy foot shall not stumble.
{3:24} If thou shalt lie down thou shalt not be afraid: and thou liest down and thy sleep shall be sweet.
{3:25} Thou shalt not be afraid from sudden terror, and from the destruction of the unjust when it shall come.
{3:26} For Jehovah shall be in thy confidence, and he watched thy foot from being taken.
{3:27} Thou shalt not withhold good from those possessing it in its being to the power of thy hand to do.
{3:28} Thou shalt not say to thy neighbor, Go, and turn back, and to-morrow I will give; and there is with thee.
{3:29} Thou shalt not fabricate evil upon thy neighbor, and he dwelling confidently with thee.
{3:30} Thou shalt not contend with man to no purpose, if he did thee no evil.
{3:31} Thou shalt not envy against a man of violence, and thou shalt choose in all his ways.
{3:32} For the perverse is an abomination of Jehovah: and his intercourse with the upright.
{3:33} The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the unjust one: and he will bless the dwelling of the just.
{3:34} But he will deride to those deriding: and he will give grace to the humble.
{3:35} The wise shall inherit glory, and the foolish exalt dishonor.
{4:1} Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
{4:2} For I gave to you good instruction; ye shall not forsake my law.
{4:3} For I was son to my father; tender and only before the face of my mother.
{4:4} And he taught me, and he will say to me, Thy heart shall hold fast my words: watch my commands and live.
{4:5} Obtain wisdom, obtain understanding: thou shalt not forget, and thou shalt not decline from the words of my mouth.
{4:6} Thou shalt not forsake her, and she will watch thee: love her, and she will guard thee.
{4:7} Wisdom the beginning; obtain wisdom, and with all thine acquisition, obtain understanding.
{4:8} Lift her up and she shall exalt thee: she will honor thee when thou shalt embrace her.
{4:9} She will give to thy head a garland of grace: a crown of glory she will deliver thee.
{4:10} Hear, my son, and receive my words, and the years of life shall be multiplied to thee.
{4:11} In the way of wisdom I taught thee; I caused thee to tread in the tracks of uprightness.
{4:12} In thy going, thy steps shall not be pressed; and if thou shalt run thou shalt not be weak.
{4:13} Lay hold upon instruction, thou shalt not let go: guard her for she is thy life.
{4:14} In the path of the unjust thou shalt not go, and thou shalt not advance in the way of the wicked.
{4:15} Reject it, thou shalt not pass in it; turn aside from it and pass by.
{4:16} For they slept not, if they shall not do evil; and their sleep was taken away, if they shall not cause to falter.
{4:17} For they ate the bread of injustice, and they will drink the wine of violences:
{4:18} The path of the just as the light shining, going and shining even to the day prepared.
{4:19} The way of the unjust as darkness: they shall not know in what they shall stumble.
{4:20} My son, attend to my word; incline thine ear to my sayings.
{4:21} They shall not turn aside from thine eyes; watch them in the midst of thy heart.
{4:22} For they are life to those finding them, and healing to all their flesh.
{4:23} Guard thy heart with all watching, for from it the goings forth of life.
{4:24} Turn away from thee perverseness of mouth, and frowardness of lips remove far oft from thee.
{4:25} Thine eyes shall look straight before, and thine eyelashes shall be right before thee.
{4:26} Make level the track of thy feet, and all thy ways shall be prepared.
{4:27} Thou shalt not decline to the right and the left: turn away thy foot from evil.
{5:1} My son, attend to my wisdom; incline thine ear to understanding:
{5:2} To watch meditation, and thy lips shall guard knowledge.
{5:3} For the lips of the strange woman will drop droppings of the honeycomb, and her palate is smooth above oil:
{5:4} And her latter state being bitter as wormwood; sharp as a two-mouthed sword.
{5:5} Her feet go down to death; her steps will hold fast to hades.
{5:6} Lest thou shalt make level the path of life, her tracks wavered; thou wilt not know.
{5:7} And now, ye sons, hear to me, and ye shall not depart from the words of my mouth.
{5:8} Remove far off from her thy way, and thou shalt not draw near to the door of her house:
{5:9} Lest thou shalt give thy strength to others, and thy years to the cruel:
{5:10} Lest strangers shall be filled with thy strength, and thy labors in the house of strangers;
{5:11} And thou didst lament in thy latter state, in the consuming of thy flesh and thy fulness,
{5:12} And thou saidst, How did I hate instruction, and my heart despise reproofs.
{5:13} And I heard not to the voice of him teaching me, and I inclined not mine ear to him instructing me.
{5:14} As I was almost in all evil in the midst of the convocation and the assembly.
{5:15} Drink water from thy pit, and flowing from the midst of thy well.
{5:16} Thy fountains shall be dispersed without; in the broad places streams of waters.
{5:17} They shall be to thee alone, and not strangers with thee.
{5:18} Thy fountain shall be blessed: and rejoice from the wife of thy youth.
{5:19} The hind of loves and the wild goat of grace; her breasts shall satiate thee in all time; thou shalt always wander in her loves.
{5:20} And wherefore, my son, wilt thou wander with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
{5:21} For before the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of man, and he makes level all his tracks.
{5:22} His iniquities shall take the unjust one, and with the cords of his sins shall he be held fast.
{5:23} He shall die in not being instructed, and he shall wander in the multitude of his folly.
{6:1} My son, if thou becamest surety for thy friend, thou didst strike thy hands for a stranger;
{6:2} Thou wert snared with the sayings of thy mouth, thou wert taken with the sayings of thy mouth.
{6:3} Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself when thou camest into the hand of thy friend; go humble thyself and enlarge thy friend.
{6:4} Thou shalt not give sleep to thine eyes, and slumber to thine eyelashes.
{6:5} Deliver thyself as the roe from the hand, and as the bird from the hand of the fowler.
{6:6} Go to the ant, thou slothful one; see her ways, and be wise:
{6:7} Which no leader to her, scribe and ruler;
{6:8} She will prepare in summer her bread, gathering her food in harvest.
{6:9} How long, O slothful one, wilt thou lie down? when wilt thou rise from thy sleep?
{6:10} A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to lie down:
{6:11} And thy poverty came as he going, and thy want as a man of the shield.
{6:12} A man of Belial, a man of iniquity, goes with perverseness of mouth.
{6:13} Pinching the eyes, speaking with the feet, teaching with his fingers;
{6:14} Perverseness in his heart, fabricating evil in all time, he will send forth strifes.
{6:15} For this, his destruction shall come suddenly; in a moment he shall be broken, and none healing.
{6:16} These six Jehovah hated, and seven an abomination of his soul:
{6:17} Eyes being lifted up; a tongue of falsehood, and hands shedding innocent blood,
{6:18} A heart fabricating purposes of iniquity; feet being quick to run to evil,
{6:19} A witness of falsehood, breathing out lies, and sending strife between brethren.
{6:20} My son, watch the commands of thy father, and thou shalt not reject the laws of thy mother:
{6:21} Tie them always upon thy heart; bind them upon thy throat.
{6:22} In thy going about it shall lead thee; in thy lying down it shall watch over thee; and awaking, it shall speak to thee.
{6:23} For the command is a lamp, and the law a light; and the way of life the reproof of instruction:
{6:24} To watch thee from the woman of evil, from the smoothness of the strange tongue.
{6:25} Thou shalt not desire her beauty in thy heart, and she shall not take thee with her eyelashes.
{6:26} For by a woman a harlot, even to a round of bread: and a man's wife will hunt the precious soul.
{6:27} A man taking fire in his bosom, shall his garments not be burnt?
{6:28} If a man shall go upon burning coals shall his feet not be burnt?
{6:29} So he going in to his neighbor's wife; all touching upon her shall not be innocent.
{6:30} They will not despise a thief if he shall steal to fill up his soul; for he will be hungry.
{6:31} And being found he shall recompense seven fold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
{6:32} He committing adultery with a woman lacked a heart: destroying his soul he will do it.
{6:33} A blow and contempt shall he find; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
{6:34} For jealousy is the wrath of man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
{6:35} He will not lift up the face of any ransom, and he will not be willing if thou shalt increase the reward.
{7:1} My son, watch my words, and thou shalt hide my commands with thee.
{7:2} Watch my commands, and live; and my law as the pupil of thine eyes.
{7:3} Bind them upon thy fingers, and write them upon the tablet of thine heart.
{7:4} Say to wisdom, Thou my sister; and thou shalt call knowledge to understanding:
{7:5} To watch thyself from the strange woman, from the stranger making smooth her sayings.
{7:6} For in the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice,
{7:7} And I shall see among the simple, I shall perceive among the sons a youth wanting heart,
{7:8} Passing in the street near her corner; and he will step the way of her house,
{7:9} In the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle of the night, in the thick darkness:
{7:10} And behold, a woman to his meeting, the attire of a harlot, and hidden of heart.
{7:11} She being noisy and perverse; her feet will not dwell in her house:
{7:12} One time without, one time in the broad ways; and she will lie in wait near every corner.
{7:13} She laid hold upon him and kissed to him; she strengthened her face, and she will say to him,
{7:14} Sacrifices of peace upon me: today I repaid my vows.
{7:15} For this, I shall come forth to thy meeting, to seek thy face, and I shall find thee.
{7:16} With adornings I spread my bed, variegated with thread of Egypt.
{7:17} I sprinkled my bed with myrrh and aloes and cinnamon.
{7:18} Come, we will be satisfied with loves till the morning: we will rejoice ourselves with loves.
{7:19} For the man not in the house, he went in a way far off.
{7:20} He took a bundle of silver in his hand; he will come to his house the day of the full moon.
{7:21} With much of her talking she caused him to turn aside; with the smoothness of her lips she will thrust him away.
{7:22} He went after her suddenly as the ox will go to the slaughter, and as the fetter for the correction of the foolish.
{7:23} Till an arrow shall cleave his liver; as a bird hastening to the snare, and not knowing that it is for his soul.
{7:24} And now, ye sons, hear to me, and attend to the sayings of my mouth.
{7:25} And thy heart shall not deviate to her ways; thou shalt not wander in her beaten paths.
{7:26} For she cast down many wounded, and the strong all being slain by her.
{7:27} Her house the ways to hades, going down to the chambers of death.
{8:1} Shall not wisdom call, and understanding give her voice?
{8:2} She stood upon the head of the heights, upon the way of the house of the beaten paths.
{8:3} At the hand of the gates, at the mouth of the city from the coming in of the doors she will cry:
{8:4} To you, ye men, I shall call, and my voice is to the sons of man.
{8:5} Understand craftiness, ye simple: and ye foolish, understand the heart.
{8:6} Hear ye, for I will speak dear things; and the openings of my lips uprightnesses.
{8:7} For my palate shall meditate the truth, and evil is the abomination of my lips.
{8:8} In justice are all the sayings of my mouth; nothing in them crooked and perverse.
{8:9} All of them straight to him understanding, and right to those finding knowledge.
{8:10} Receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge above tried gold.
{8:11} For wisdom is good above pearls, and all delights shall not be made equal with her.
{8:12} I wisdom dwelt with prudence, and I shall find the knowledge of machinations.
{8:13} The fear of Jehovah hates evil: pride and haughtiness, and the evil way, and the mouth of perverseness I hated.
{8:14} To me counsel and wisdom: I am understanding; to me is strength.
{8:15} By me kings shall reign, and princes shall decree justice.
{8:16} By me chiefs shall have dominion, and nobles all judging the earth.
{8:17} I loved those loving me: and they seeking me shall find me.
{8:18} Riches and honor are with me; splendid riches and justice.
{8:19} My fruit is good above gold, and above pure gold; and my gain above tried silver.
{8:20} I shall go in the way of justice, in the midst of the beaten paths of judgment:
{8:21} To cause those loving me to inherit existence: and I will fill their treasures.
{8:22} Jehovah set me up the beginning of his way, before his works from ancient time.
{8:23} From forever I was knit together, from the beginning, from the first of the earth.
{8:24} In no depths was I begun; in no fountains abundant in waters.
{8:25} Before the mountains were settled; before the hills I had a beginning:
{8:26} Yet he made not the earth and the fields, and the head of the clods of the habitable globe.
{8:27} In his preparing the heavens I was there: in his inscribing a circle upon the face of the deep:
{8:28} In his making firm the clouds from above: in his strengthening the fountains of the deep:
{8:29} In his setting his law to the sea, and the waters shall not pass by his mouth; in his making firm the foundations of the earth:
{8:30} And I shall be near him the builder, and I shall be a delight of day, day, smiling before him in all time.
{8:31} Smiling in the habitable globe of his earth; and my delight with the sons of man.
{8:32} And now ye sons, hear to me: and the happy shall watch my ways.
{8:33} Hear ye instructions, and be wise, and ye shall not reject it.
{8:34} Happy the man hearing to me, to watch at my doors day, day; to watch the door posts of my entrances.
{8:35} For he finding me, the finding of life, and he shall bring forth acceptance from Jehovah.
{8:36} And he sinning against me did violence to his soul: all hating me loved death.
{9:1} Wisdom built her house, she hewed out her seven pillars:
{9:2} She slaughtered her slaughter; she mingled her wine; also she prepared her table.
{9:3} She sent forth her girls: she will call upon the wings of the heights of the city,
{9:4} Who the simple, he shall turn aside here: he wanting heart, she said to him,
{9:5} Come ye, eat of my bread, and drink ye of the wine I mingled.
{9:6} Forsake ye the foolish, and live; and go straight in the way of understanding.
{9:7} He instructing him mocking received to himself dishonor: and he reproving to the unjust one, his blemish.
{9:8} Thou shalt not reprove him mocking, lest he shall hate thee: reprove to the wise one and he will love thee.
{9:9} Thou shalt give to the wise one and he will be more wise: make known to the just one and he will add receiving.
{9:10} The beginning of wisdom is the fear of Jehovah, and the knowledge of the holy ones is understanding.
{9:11} For in me thy days shall be multiplied, and years of life shall be added to thee.
{9:12} If thou wert wise, thou wert wise for thyself: and thou mockedst, thou alone shalt suffer.
{9:13} A woman of folly being noisy, simple, and she knew not anything.
{9:14} And sitting at the door of her house, upon the throne of the heights of the city,
{9:15} To call to those passing the way, making straight their paths:
{9:16} Who is simple, he shall turn aside here: and he wanting heart, and she said to him,
{9:17} Stolen waters will be sweet, and the bread of secrets shall be pleasant.
{9:18} And he knew not that there the shades; her called ones in the depths of hades.
{10:1} Proverbs of Solomon. A wise son will gladden a father: and a son of the foolish will grieve his mother.
{10:2} Treasures of injustice shall not profit, and justice shall deliver from death.
{10:3} Jehovah will not cause the soul of the just one to hunger: and he will thrust away the desire of the unjust.
{10:4} A slothful hand makes poverty, and the hand of the active will make rich.
{10:5} He gathering in summer, is a prudent son: he lying in deep sleep in harvest, a son causing shame.
{10:6} Blessings upon the head of the just one: and violence shall cover the mouth of the unjust.
{10:7} The memory of the just one for blessing: and the name of the wicked shall be rotten.
{10:8} The wise of heart will receive commands: and the foolish of lips shall fall.
{10:9} He going in integrity shall go confidently: and he perverting his ways shall be known.
{10:10} He pinching the eye shall give pain: and the foolish of lips shall fall.
{10:11} A fountain of life the mouth of the just one: and violence shall cover the mouth of the unjust.
{10:12} Hatred will excite strifes: and love will cover over all transgressions.
{10:13} In the lips of him understanding, wisdom shall be found: and a rod for the back of him wanting heart.
{10:14} The wise shall hide knowledge: and the mouth of the foolish drew near destruction.
{10:15} The wealth of the rich his strong city: the destruction of the poor their poverty.
{10:16} The labors of the just one, to life: the increase of the unjust to sin.
{10:17} The path to life is watching instruction: and he forsaking reproof goes astray.
{10:18} He covering hatred with lips of falsehood, and he bringing forth slander, is foolish.
{10:19} In the multitude of words transgression shall not cease: and he withholding his lips is prudent.
{10:20} The tongue of the just is choice silver: the heart of the unjust is as little.
{10:21} The lips of the just one shall feed many: and fools in wanting heart, shall die.
{10:22} The blessing of Jehovah it will make rich, and it will not add pain with it.
{10:23} As laughter to the foolish one, to do mischief: and wisdom is to the man of understanding.
{10:24} The fear of the unjust one it shall come to him: and the desire of the just shall be given.
{10:25} As the whirlwind passing away the unjust one is not: and the just one a foundation forever.
{10:26} As vinegar to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes, so is the slothful one to those sending him.
{10:27} The fear of Jehovah will add days, and the years of the unjust shall be diminished.
{10:28} The hope of the just is gladness: and the expectation of the unjust shall perish.
{10:29} The way of Jehovah is a fortress to the upright one: and destruction to those doing iniquity.
{10:30} The just one shall not be moved forever: and the unjust shall not inhabit the earth.
{10:31} The mouth of the just one shall germinate wisdom: and the tongue of perverseness shall be cut off.
{10:32} The lips of the just one shall know acceptance: and the mouth of the unjust, perverseness.
{11:1} Balances of deceit, an abomination of Jehovah: and a whole stone his delight.
{11:2} Pride coming, and dishonor will come: and wisdom with the humble.
{11:3} The integrity of the upright shall guide them: and the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.
{11:4} Wealth will not profit in the day of wrath, and justice will deliver from death.
{11:5} The justice of the blameless shall make straight his way, and in his injustice the unjust shall fall.
{11:6} The justice of the upright shall deliver them, and transgressors shall be taken in their mischief.
{11:7} In the death of an unjust man expectation shall perish: and the hope of the vain shall perish.
{11:8} The just one was delivered from straits, and the unjust will come in his stead.
{11:9} With the mouth the profane will destroy his neighbor: and by knowledge, shall the just one be delivered.
{11:10} In the good of the just the city will exult: and in the perishing of the unjust it rejoiced.
{11:11} By the blessing of the upright the city shall be exalted: and by the mouth of the unjust it shall be overthrown.
{11:12} He wanting heart despised for his neighbor: and a man of understanding will be silent.
{11:13} He going about tale-bearing reveals a secret: and he being faithful of spirit hides the word.
{11:14} In no guidance the people will fall: and salvation in a multitude of counseling.
{11:15} The evil one shall become evil, for he became surety for a stranger: and he hating those striking hands being secure.
{11:16} A woman of grace will obtain honor, and the powerful will obtain riches.
{11:17} The man of mercy benefited his soul: and the cruel troubled his flesh.
{11:18} The unjust one did a work of falsehood: and the seed of justice the reward of truth.
{11:19} So justice to life, and he pursuing evil, to his death.
{11:20} The perverse of heart are an abomination of Jehovah, and the blameless of way his delight.
{11:21} Hand to hand, the evil one shall not be unpunished: and the seed of the just were delivered.

{21:24} Proud, arrogant, mocking, is his name doing in the wrath of pride.
{21:25} The desire of the slothful shall kill him, for his hands refused to work,
{21:26} He longed a longing all the day: and the just one shall give and not keep back.
{21:27} The sacrifice of the unjust is an abomination, for also he will bring it in mischief.
{21:28} A witness of lies shall perish: and a man hearing, shall speak clearly.
{21:29} An unjust man strengthened with his face: and the upright he will prepare his ways.
{21:30} No wisdom and no understanding, and no counsel against Jehovah.
{21:31} The horse is prepared for the day of war and salvation is to Jehovah.
{22:1} A Name to be chosen rather than much riches, and good grace rather than gold.
{22:2} The rich and poor one met together: Jehovah made them all.
{22:3} The crafty saw evil, and he will hide, and the simple passed on and were punished.
{22:4} The end of humility the fear of Jehovah, riches and honor and life.
{22:5} Thorns, snares, in the way of the perverse one: he watching his soul shall be far from them.
{22:6} Straiten to a youth upon the mouth of his way, also when he shall grow old he will not depart from it.
{22:7} The rich one will rule over the poor, and he borrowing, a servant to the man lending.
{22:8} He sowing iniquity shall reap vanity, and the rod of his wrath shall be finished.
{22:9} The good eye it shall be blessed, for he gave from his bread to the poor.
{22:10} Cast out him mocking, and strife shall go out, and contention shall cease and dishonor.
{22:11} He loving pureness of heart the grace of his lips, the king is his friend.
{22:12} The eyes of Jehovah guarded knowledge, and he will overthrow the words of him transgressing.
{22:13} The slothful one said, A lion without; I shall be slain in the midst of the broad places.
{22:14} The mouth of the strange woman a deep pit: and he cursing Jehovah shall fall there.
{22:15} Folly being bound in the heart of a youth; the rod of correction shall remove it far off from him.
{22:16} He oppressing the poor one to increase for himself, he gave to the rich; also to want.
{22:17} Incline thine ear and hear the words of the wise, and thou shalt set thy heart to my knowledge.
{22:18} For pleasant things if thou shalt watch them in thy belly; they shall be prepared together for thy lips.
{22:19} For thy trust to be in Jehovah, I caused thee to know today, thee also.
{22:20} Did I not write to thee three days ago in counsels and knowledge?
{22:21} To cause thee to know the truth of the words of truth; to turn back the words of truth to those sending thee?
{22:22} Thou shalt not strip the poor because he is poor: and thou shalt not crush the humble in the gate.
{22:23} For Jehovah will contend their contention, and rob the soul to those robbing them.
{22:24} Thou shalt not be companion of the possessor of anger, and with the man of wrath thou shalt not go:
{22:25} Lest thou shalt learn his ways and take a snare to thy soul.
{22:26} Thou shalt not be with those striking the hand with those pledging for debts.
{22:27} If not to thee to requite, why shall he take thy bed from under thee?
{22:28} Thou shalt not remove the old bound which thy fathers made.
{22:29} Sawest thou a man apt in his works? Before kings shall he stand; he shall not stand before the dark ones.
{23:1} If thou shalt sit to eat with a ruler, understanding, thou shalt understand what is before thee.
{23:2} And put a knife to thy swallow if thou the possessor of a soul.
{23:3} Thou shalt not long for his dainties: and it is the bread of lies.
{23:4} Thou shalt not labor to become rich: cease from thy wisdom.
{23:5} Wilt thou cause thine eyes to fly upon it and it is not? for making, it will make to it wings; as an eagle and it flew to the heavens.
{23:6} Thou shalt not eat the bread of an evil eye, and ye shall not long for its dainties:
{23:7} Like him estimating evil in his soul, so is he: Eat and drink, he will say to thee; and his heart not with thee.
{23:8} Thy morsel which thou didst eat thou shalt vomit forth and destroy thy pleasant words.
{23:9} In the ears of the foolish thou shalt not speak, for he will despise for the understanding of thy words.
{23:10} Thou shalt not remove the old bound; and into the field of the orphans thou shalt not come:
{23:11} For he redeeming them, he is strong; he will contend their contention with thee.
{23:12} Bring thy heart to instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.
{23:13} Thou shalt not withhold instruction from youth: if thou shalt strike him with a rod he shall not die.
{23:14} Thou shalt strike him with the rod, and thou shalt deliver his soul from hades.
{23:15} My son, if thy heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.
{23:16} And my reins shall exult in the speaking of thy lips uprightnesses.
{23:17} Thy heart shall not envy against those sinning: but be in the fear of Jehovah all the day.
{23:18} But there is a latter state, and thine expectation shall not be cut off.
{23:19} Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thy heart right in the way.
{23:20} Thou shalt not be with those drinking wine to excess, and with squanderers of flesh to them:
{23:21} For the drunkard and the squanderer shall be dispossessed: and slumber shall clothe with rags.
{23:22} Hear to thy father that begat thee, and thou shalt not despise thy mother when growing old.
{23:23} Buy the truth, and thou shalt not sell wisdom and instruction and understanding.
{23:24} The father of the just one rejoicing, shall rejoice: he shall beget a wise one and shall rejoice in him.
{23:25} Thy father shall rejoice, and thy mother, and she begetting thee shall exult.
{23:26} My son, thou shalt give thy heart to me, and thine eyes shall delight in my way.
{23:27} For a harlot is a deep ditch; and a strong woman a narrow well.
{23:28} She also will lie in wait as for prey, and she will add those transgressing among men.
{23:29} To whom wo? to whom want? to whom strife? to whom complaint? to whom wounds gratuitously? to whom dark flashings of the eyes?
{23:30} To those remaining at the wine; to those going to seek mixed wine.
{23:31} Thou shalt not look upon wine when it shall be red, when it shall give its eye in the cup, it will go about in uprightnesses.
{23:32} Its latter state it will bite as serpent, and sting as a viper.
{23:33} Thine eyes shall see strange women, and thy heart shall speak perverseness.
{23:34} And thou wert as he lying down in the heart of the sea, and as he lying down upon the head of the mast.
{23:35} They struck me, I was not pained; they beat me, I knew not: when shall I awake? I will add, I will yet seek it.
{24:1} Thou shalt not envy against men of evil, thou shalt not desire to be with them.
{24:2} For their heart will meditate destruction, and their lips will speak labor.
{24:3} By wisdom a house will be built, and it will be prepared by understanding:
{24:4} And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.
{24:5} A wise man is in strength, and a man of knowledge strengthens power.
{24:6} For by guidance thou shalt make to thee war, and in the multitude of counselors salvation.
{24:7} High things to the foolish is wisdom: in the gate he will not open his mouth.
{24:8} He purposing to do evil for himself shall be called the master of mischief.
{24:9} The purpose of folly is sin, and he mocking, an abomination to man.
{24:10} Wilt thou be discouraged in the day of straits thy strength is narrow.
{24:11} If thou shalt refrain to deliver those being brought to death, and those going to be slain;
{24:12} If thou shalt say, Behold, we knew not this; will not he trying hearts, understand? and he guarding thy soul, knew? and he turned back to man according to his work.
{24:13} My son, eat honey, for it is good; and the dropping of honey being sweet to thy palate.
{24:14} So the knowledge of wisdom to thy soul if thou shalt find: and there is a latter state and thine expectation shall not be cut off.
{24:15} Thou shalt not lay wait, O wicked one, against the dwelling of the just one; thou shalt not destroy his resting place:
{24:16} For the just one shall fall seven times, and rise: and the unjust shall be weak in evil.
{24:17} In the falling of thine enemies thou shalt not rejoice, and in his stumbling thy heart shall not exult:
{24:18} Lest Jehovah shall see and it be evil in his eyes, and he turn back from him his anger.
{24:19} Thou shalt not be angry against the evil; thou shalt not envy against the unjust:
{24:20} For there shall be no latter state to the evil one: the light of the unjust shall be extinguished.
{24:21} My son, fear thou Jehovah and the king: thou shalt not intermingle with those changing:
{24:22} For suddenly shall their calamity rise, and who shall make known the misfortune of them two?
{24:23} Also these to the wise. To look upon the face in judgment is not good.
{24:24} He saying to the unjust, Thou art just; peoples shall curse him, and nations shall curse him:
{24:25} And it shall be pleasant to those reproving, and a blessing of good shall come upon them.
{24:26} He shall kiss the lips turning back right words.
{24:27} Prepare thy work without, and make it ready for thee in the field afterwards; and build thy house.
{24:28} Thou shalt not be a witness gratuitously against thy neighbor, and deceive not with thy lips.
{24:29} Thou shalt not say, According to what he did to me, thus will I do to him: I will turn back to the man according to his work.
{24:30} I passed upon the field of the slothful man, and upon the vineyard of the man wanting heart;
{24:31} And behold, it came up all of it with thorns; brambles covered its face, and the wall of its stones was overthrown.
{24:32} And I shall see and set my heart: I looked, I took instruction.
{24:33} A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to lie down:
{24:34} And thy poverty came going about, and thy want as a man of shield.
{25:1} Also these the proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed.
{25:2} The glory of God to conceal the word: and the glory of kings to search the word.
{25:3} The heavens for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings not searched out.
{25:4} Take ye away the dross from the silver, and a vessel shall come forth for the goldsmith.
{25:5} Take ye away the unjust one from before the king, and his throne shall be prepared in justice.
{25:6} Thou shalt not show thyself proud before the king, and thou shalt not stand in the place of the great.
{25:7} For good to say to thee, Come up hither, rather than humbling thyself before the noble whom thine eye saw.
{25:8} Thou shalt not go forth hastily to strive, lest what thou shalt do in its latter state in thy neighbor putting thee to shame.
{25:9} Contend thy contention with thy neighbor; and thou shalt not reveal the secret of another:
{25:10} Lest he hearing shall reproach thee, and thine infamy shall not turn away.
{25:11} Apples of gold in images of silver is the word spoken upon its wheels.
{25:12} An earring of gold and a necklace of gold, the wise one reproving upon the hearing ear.
{25:13} As the cold of snow in the day of harvest a faithful messenger to those sending him: he shall restore the soul of his lord.
{25:14} Clouds and wind and not rain, a man boasting in a gift of falsehood.
{25:15} In slowness to anger shall the prince be persuaded, and the soft tongue shall break the bones.
{25:16} Thou didst find honey; eat thy sufficiency, lest thou shalt be satiated, and thou vomit it forth.
{25:17} Make rare thy foot from thy neighbor's house, lest he shall be satiated with thee, and hate thee.
{25:18} A mallet and a sword and an arrow sharpened, the man answering against his neighbor testimony of falsehood.
{25:19} A bad tooth and a wavering foot, the confidence of the faithless one in the day of straits.
{25:20} He removing a covering in the day of cold, and vinegar upon nitre, and he singing in songs to an evil heart.
{25:21} If thine enemy hunger, give him bread to eat; and if he thirst, give him water to drink:
{25:22} For thou tookest up coals of fire upon his head, and Jehovah will recompense to thee.
{25:23} The north wind will set free the rain, and an angry face, a hidden tongue.
{25:24} Good to dwell upon a corner of the roof rather than with a woman of strifes and a house of community.
{25:25} Cold waters to the fainting soul, and a good message from a land far off.
{25:26} A fountain trampled down, and a fountain corrupted, the just one turned aside before the unjust one.
{25:27} To eat much honey is not good: and to seek out their honor, not honor.
{25:28} A city being broken down, and not a wall, a man who restrains not to his spirit.
{26:1} As snow in summer and as rain in harvest, so honor not becoming to the foolish one.
{26:2} As the sparrow for wandering, as the swallow for flying, so the curse shall not come in vain.
{26:3} A whip for the horse, the curb for the ass, and the rod for the back of the foolish.
{26:4} Thou shalt not answer the foolish according to his folly lest thou shalt be like to him.
{26:5} Answer the foolish according to his folly lest he shall be wise in his own eyes.
{26:6} He drank violence, cutting off the feet, sending words by the hand of the foolish one.
{26:7} The legs of the lame were weak, and a parable in the mouth of the foolish.
{26:8} As a bundle of stones in a heap of stones, so he giving honor to the foolish one.
{26:9} A thorn going up into the hand of a drunkard, a parable in the mouth of the foolish.
{26:10} The great one piercing all, and he hired the foolish one, and those passing by.
{26:11} As a dog turned back upon his vomit, the foolish one repeated in his folly.
{26:12} Sawest thou a man wise in his eyes? hope is for the foolish one more than for him.
{26:13} The slothful one said, A lion in the way; a lion between the broad places.
{26:14} A door will turn upon its hinge, and the slothful upon his bed.
{26:15} The slothful one hid his hand in the dish; he was weary to turn it back to his mouth.
{26:16} The slothful one is wise in his eyes more than seven turning back a reason.
{26:17} Laying hold upon the ears of a dog, he passing by overflowing upon strife not to him.
{26:18} As a madman casting fiery darts, arrows and death,
{26:19} So the man deceiving his neighbor and saying, Am I not sporting?
{26:20} In the ceasing of wood, fire will go out: and in not being a tale-bearer, strife will subside.
{26:21} As charcoal to burning coals and woods to fire, and a man of strifes to kindle strife.
{26:22} The words of a tale-bearer as dainty morsels, and they will go down to the chambers of the belly.
{26:23} Silver dross covering over a pot-sherd, burning lips and an evil heart.
{26:24} He hating will be known by his lips, and he will set deceit in his midst;
{26:25} When his voice will compassionate, thou shalt not believe him, for seven abominations in his heart.
{26:26} Hatred will be covered by deceit, his evil will be revealed in the convocation.
{26:27} He digging a pit shall fall into it: and he rolling a stone it shall turn back upon him.
{26:28} A tongue of falsehood will hate its crushing, and a smooth mouth will make an overthrow.
{27:1} Thou shalt not boast upon the day of the morrow, for thou shalt not know what a day shall bring forth.
{27:2} A stranger shall praise thee, and not thy mouth; a stranger, and not thy lips.
{27:3} A stone is heavy and sand a burden, and the wrath of the foolish one heavy more than they two.
{27:4} Wrath is cruelty, and anger an overflowing; and who shall stand before jealousy?
{27:5} Naked rebuke is good above secret love.
{27:6} Faithful the wounds of a friend; and abundant the kisses of an enemy.
{27:7} The full soul will tread down the honey droppings, and to the hungry soul all bitter is sweet.
{27:8} As the bird wandering from her nest, so is a man wandering from his place.
{27:9} Oil and incense will rejoice the heart: and the sweetness from his friend from the counsel of the soul.
{27:10} Thy friend and thy father's friend thou shalt not forsake; and thou shalt not go to thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: good he dwelling near, more than a brother far off.
{27:11} My son, be wise and gladden my heart, and I will turn back word to him reproaching me.
{27:12} The prudent one saw the evil, he hid himself; the simple passed and were punished.
{27:13} Take his garment pledging a stranger, and bind him by a pledge for a strange woman.
{27:14} He blessing his friend with a great voice, rising early in the morning, a curse shall be reckoned to him.
{27:15} A dropping thrust forth in the day of rain and a woman of strifes were alike.
{27:16} He hiding her, hid the wind, and he shall call the oil of his right hand.
{27:17} Iron will sharpen upon iron; and a man will sharpen the face of his friend.
{27:18} He guarding the fig tree shall eat its fruit: and he watching his lord shall be honored.
{27:19} As in water, face to face, so the heart of man to man.
{27:20} Hades and destruction shall not be satisfied; and the eyes of man shall not be satisfied.
{27:21} The crucible for silver, and the furnace for gold, and a man to the mouth praising him.
{27:22} If thou shalt pound the foolish in a mortar in the midst of the grain with a pestle, thou shalt not remove from him his folly.
{27:23} Knowing, thou shalt know the face of thy flock; set thy heart to thy herds.
{27:24} For not strength forever, and not consecration to generation and generation.
{27:25} The grass was uncovered and the young herbage was seen; and the green plants of the mountains were gathered.
{27:26} Lambs for thy clothing, and the he goats the price of the field.
{27:27} And enough of goats milk for thy bread, and for the bread of thy house, and the life of thy girls.
{28:1} The unjust fled and none pursuing, and the just shall be confident as the young lion.
{28:2} In the transgression of a land many its chiefs: and by a man understanding to know, the place shall be extended.
{28:3} A poor man oppressing the poor, a sweeping rain and no bread.
{28:4} They forsaking the law will praise the unjust: and they watching the law, shall contend with them.
{28:5} Men of evil shall not understand judgment: and they seeking Jehovah shall understand all.
{28:6} Good the poor one going in his integrity above him perverting the ways, and he the rich.
{28:7} He watching the law a son understanding: and the companion of squanderers will shame his father.
{28:8} He increasing by interest and usury, he shall gather it for him compassionating the poor.
{28:9} He turning away his ear from hearing the law, also his prayer is an abomination.
{28:10} He causing the upright to wander in an evil way, into his pit shall he fall: and the good shall inherit complete things.
{28:11} The rich man is wise in his eyes, and the poor one understanding shall search him out.
{28:12} In the rejoicing of the just, much glory: in the rising up of the unjust, man will hide himself.
{28:13} He covering his transgression shall not prosper: but he confessing and forsaking, shall be compassionated.
{28:14} Happy the man fearing always: and he hardening his heart shall fall into evil.
{28:15} A roaring lion and a greedy bear the unjust one ruling over a poor people.
{28:16} A prince wanting understanding and great in oppressions: he hating gain shall lengthen the days.
{28:17} He terrifying violence upon the blood of a soul shall flee even to the pit; none shall hold fast upon him.
{28:18} He going uprightly shall be saved; and he being violent in the ways shall fall at once.
{28:19} He working his land shall be filled with bread: and he pursuing the vain shall be filled with poverty.
{28:20} A man of faithfulness multiplied blessings: and he hasting to be rich shall not be innocent.
{28:21} To look upon faces is not good and for a morsel of bread the man will transgress.
{28:22} A man of evil eye hasted for riches, and knew not that want shall come upon him.
{28:23} He reproving a man, afterwards shall find favor more than he smoothing the tongue.
{28:24} He stripping his father and his mother, and saying, No transgression; is companion to a man destroying.
{28:25} He enlarging the soul shall excite strife: and he trusting upon Jehovah shall he made fat.
{28:26} He trusting in his heart is foolish: and he going in wisdom shall be delivered.
{28:27} He giving to the poor wants not: and he hiding his eyes increased curses.
{28:28} In the rising up of the unjust, man shalt hide: and in their perishing, the lust shall increase.
{29:1} A Man of reproofs hardening the neck, shall be suddenly broken, and no healing.
{29:2} In the increasing of the just the people will rejoice: and in the ruling of the unjust one the people will groan.
{29:3} A man loving wisdom will gladden his father: and he feeding harlots shall destroy riches.
{29:4} A king in judgment shall establish the land: and a man of presents shall overthrow it.
{29:5} A man making smooth against his neighbor spreads a net for his steps.
{29:6} In the transgression of an evil man is a snare: and the just one shall rejoice and be glad:
{29:7} The just one knew the judgment of the poor: the unjust one will not understand knowledge.
{29:8} Men of derision will kindle up a city: and the wise will turn away anger.
{29:9} A wise man contending with a foolish man and raging and laughing, and no rest.
{29:10} Men of bloods will hate the upright one: and the upright will seek his soul.
{29:11} The foolish one will bring forth all his spirit; and the wise one will restrain it back.
{29:12} A ruler listening to the word of falsehood, all serving him are unjust.
{29:13} The poor one and the man of oppressions met together: Jehovah enlightening the eyes of them both.
{29:14} The king judging the poor in truth, his throne shall be established for a testimony.
{29:15} The rod and reproofs will give wisdom: and the youth being left shames his mother.
{29:16} In increasing the unjust, transgressions will increase: and the just all look upon their fall.
{29:17} Correct thy son and he shall cause thee to rest, and he shall give delight to thy soul.
{29:18} In no vision the people shall be unruly: and he watching the law, happy is he.
{29:19} A servant will not be corrected by words: for he will understand and not answer.
{29:20} Thou sawest a man hasty in his words: hope to the foolish one more than to him.
{29:21} He bringing up his servant delicately from youth, and his latter state will be a child.
{29:22} A man of anger will excite strife, and the possessor of wrath increased transgression.
{29:23} A man's pride shall bring him low: and honor shall uphold him humble of spirit.
{29:24} He dividing with a thief, hates his soul: he shall hear cursing and shall not announce.
{29:25} The fear of man will give a snare: and he trusting in Jehovah shall be exalted.
{29:26} Many are seeking the face of the ruler, and from Jehovah a man's judgment.
{29:27} A man of iniquity is an abomination of the just; and the upright of way, an abomination of the unjust one.
{30:1} The words of Agur, son of Jakeh: the lifting up: the declaration of the man to Ithiel; to Ithiel and Ucal:
{30:2} For I am brutish more than man, and not the understanding of a man to me.
{30:3} I learnt not wisdom, and I shall not know the knowledge of the holy.
{30:4} Who went up to the heavens, and came down? who gathered the wind in his fists? who bound the waters in a garment? who set up all the ends of the earth? what his name and what his son's name, if thou shalt know?
{30:5} All the word of God is purified: he a shield to those trusting in him.
{30:6} Thou shalt not add to his words lest he reprove in thee, and thou wert false.
{30:7} Two things I asked from thee, thou wilt not withhold from me before I shall die:
{30:8} Vanity and the word of falsehood remove far from me; thou wilt not give to me poverty and riches; feed me with bread of my allowance:
{30:9} Lest I shall be filled and I spake lies, and said, Who is Jehovah? and lest I shall be dispossessed and I stole, and I laid hold upon the name of God.
{30:10} Thou shalt not slander the servant to his lord lest he shall curse thee, and thou wert guilty.
{30:11} A generation will curse its father, and will not bless its mother.
{30:12} A generation pure in its eyes, and not washed from its finding.
{30:13} A generation, how its eyes were raised up and its eyelashes will be lifted up.
{30:14} A generation, its teeth swords, and its biter's teeth, knives, to devour the poor from the land, and the needy from man.
{30:15} To the leech two daughters: Give, give. Behold, three shall not satisfied; four shall not say, Wealth:
{30:16} Hades; and the closed womb; the earth not filled with water; and fire said not, Wealth.
{30:17} The eye shall mock to his father, and despise to obey the mother, the ravens of the valley shall bore it out and the sons of the eagle shall eat it.
{30:18} They three were wonderful above me; and four, I knew them not:
{30:19} The way of the eagle in the heavens; the way of the serpent upon the rock; the way of the ship in the heart of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.
{30:20} So the way of a woman committing adultery; eating and wiping her mouth, and saying, I transgressed not.
{30:21} For three the earth was moved, and for four, which it shall not be able to lift up:
{30:22} For a servant when he shall reign; and the foolish one when he shall be filled with bread;
{30:23} For a hated woman when she shall be married and a maid when she shall inherit to her mistress.
{30:24} They four the small of the earth, and they are wise, being made wise:
{30:25} The ants a people not strong, and they will prepare their bread in the summer;
{30:26} The rabbits a people not strong, and they will set their house in the rock;
{30:27} To the locust no king, and it will go forth divided all of them;
{30:28} The lizard will take hold with their hands, and it is in the temples of the king.
{30:29} They three making good the step, and four, making good to go:
{30:30} The lion strong among cattle, and he will not turn back from the face of all;
{30:31} One girded in loins, or a he goat; and a king, no rising up with him.
{30:32} If thou wert foolish in lifting up thyself, and if thou purposed, the hand to the mouth.
{30:33} For the pressure of milk will bring forth cheese, and the pressure of the nose will bring forth blood: and the pressure of wrath will, bring forth contention.
{31:1} The words of Lemuel the king, the lifting up which his mother will instruct him.
{31:2} What, my son? and what the son of my womb? and what the son of my vows?
{31:3} Thou shalt not give thy strength to women, and thy ways to the destroying of kings.
{31:4} Not for kings, O Lemuel, not for kings to drink and for princes the desire of strong drink:
{31:5} Lest he shall drink and forget what is prescribed, and change the judgment of all the sons of affliction.
{31:6} Ye shall give strong drink to him perishing, and wine to the bitter of soul.
