{1:1} And it will be in the days of the judging of the judges, and there will be a famine in the land. And a man from the house of bread of Judah will go to sojourn in the field of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.
{1:2} And the name of the man Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi, and the name of his two sons, Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites from the house of bread of Judah. And they will come to the field of Moab and be there.
{1:3} And Elimelech will die, the husband of Naomi; and she will be left, and her two sons.
{1:4} And they will take to them wives from the Moabitesses; the name of the one, Orpah, and the name of the second, Ruth: and they will dwell there about ten years.
{1:5} And Mahlon and chilion, also they two, will die; and the woman will be left of her two children and of her husband.
{1:6} And she will arise and her daughters-in-law, and she will turn back from the field of Moab: for she heard in the field of Moab that Jehovah reviewed his people to give bread to them.
{1:7} And she will go forth from the place where she was there, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they will go in the way to turn back to the land of Judah.
{1:8} And Naomi will say to her two daughters-in-law, Go, turn back each to the house of her mother: Jehovah will do mercy with you according as ye did with the dead, and with me.
{1:9} Jehovah will give to you, and find ye rest, each in the house of her husband And she will kiss to them, and they will lift up their voice and weep.
{1:10} And they will say to her, But with thee we will turn back to thy people.
{1:11} And Naomi will say, Turn back, my daughters: wherefore will ye go with me? are yet to me sons in my bowels, and they were to you for husbands?
{1:12} Turn back, my daughters, therefore; for I grew old from being for a husband. If I said, There is hope to me, also I was this night to a husband, and also I bare sons;
{1:13} Will ye wait for them till they shall grow? Will remain shut up for them not to be for a husband? Nay, my daughters, for it is bitter to me greatly for you, that the hand of Jehovah will go forth against me.
{1:14} And they will lift up their voice and weep yet. And Orpah will kiss to her mother-in-law; and Ruth adhered to her.
{1:15} And she will say, Behold, thy sister-in-law turned back to her people, and to her gods: turn thou back after thy sister-in-law.
{1:16} And Ruth will say, Thou shalt not urge upon me to forsake thee, to turn back from after thee: for where thou shalt go, I will go; and where thou shalt lodge, I will lodge: thy people my people, and thy God my God:
{1:17} Where thou shalt die, I will die, and there will I be buried: thus will Jehovah do to me, and thus will he add, for death shall separate between me and between thee.
{1:18} And she will see that she strengthening herself to go with her, and she will cease to speak to her.
{1:19} And they two will go till they came to the house of bread. And it will be as they came to the house of bread, and all the city will be moved at them, and they will say, Is this Naomi?
{1:20} And she will say to them, Ye shall not call to me Naomi; call to me, Mara: for the Almighty made bitter to me greatly.
{1:21} I went away full, and Jehovah turned me back empty; wherefore will ye call to me Naomi, and Jehovah humbled me, and the Almighty did evil to me?
{1:22} And Naomi will turn back, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law, with her, turned back from the field of Moab: and they came to the house of bread in the beginning of the harvest of barley.
{2:1} And to Naomi an acquaintance to her husband, a strong man of wealth, from the family of Elimelech; and his name Boaz.
{2:2} And Ruth the Moabitess will say to Naomi, I will now go to the field and I will gather among the ears after; whom I shall find favor in his eyes. And she will say to her, Go, my daughter.
{2:3} And she will go, and come and gather in the field after the reapers; and she will happen from chance upon a part of the field to Boaz, who was from the family of Elimelech.
{2:4} And behold, Boaz came from the house of bread, and he will say to the reapers, Jehovah be with you. And they will say to him, Jehovah will bless thee.
{2:5} And Boaz will say to his young man set over the reapers, To whom this maiden?
{2:6} And the young man set over the reapers will answer and say, The Moabitess maiden; she turned back with Naomi from the field of Moab.
{2:7} And she will say, I will gather now; and I collected among the sheaves after the reapers: and she will stand from that time of the morning, and even to this time of her sitting in the house a little.
{2:8} And Boaz will say to Ruth, Heardest thou not, my daughter? Thou shalt not go to gather in another field, and also thou shalt not pass away from this; and here thou shalt adhere with my maidens:
{2:9} Thine eyes upon the field which they shall reap, and thou wentest after them: did I not command the young men not to touch thee? And being thirsty and go thou to the vessels and drink from what the young men shall draw.
{2:10} And she will fall upon her face and worship to the earth, and she will say to him, Wherefore did I find favor in thine eyes, and thou didst recognize me, and I a stranger?
{2:11} And Boaz will answer and say to her, Announcing, it was announced to me all that thou didst with thy mother-in-law after the death of thy husband: and thou wilt leave thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy birth, and thou wilt come to a people thou knewest not yesterday the third day.
{2:12} Jehovah will recompense thy work, and thy reward shall be complete from Jehovah God of Israel, because thou camest to trust under his wings.
{2:13} And she will say, Shall I find favor in thine eyes, my lord? For thou didst comfort me, and that thou spakest to the heart of thy servant, and shall I not be as one of thy servants?
{2:14} And Boaz will say to her, At the time of eating draw near hither and eat from the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she will sit by side of the reapers: and he will lay hold of the parched grain for her, and she will eat and be satisfied, and will leave.
{2:15} And she will rise up to gather, and Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Also she shall gather between the sheaves, and ye shall not shame her:
{2:16} And also draw ye out for her from the sheaves and leave, and she gathering; and ye shall not rebuke her.
{2:17} And she will gather in the field till the evening, and she will beat out what she gathered, and it will be about an ephah of barley.
{2:18} And she will lift up and come to the city: and her mother-in-law will see what she gathered: and she will bring forth and give to her what she left from her being filled.
{2:19} And her mother-in-law will say to her, Where didst thou gather this day? and where didst thou work? he recognizing thee shall be blessed. And she will announce to her mother-in-law whom she worked with him, and she will say, The name of the man whom I worked with him this day, is Boaz.
{2:20} And Naomi will say to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he to Jehovah, who let not go his mercy with the living and with the dead. Naomi said to her, The man is near to us, he is blood relative.
{2:21} And Ruth the Moabitess will say, Also that he said to me, With the young men which are to me thou shalt adhere till they finished all the harvest which is to me.
{2:22} And Naomi will say to Ruth her daughter-in-law, Good, my daughter, that thou shalt go with his maidens, and they shall not light upon thee in another field.
{2:23} And she will adhere to the maidens of Boaz, to gather even to the end of the harvest of barley and the harvest of wheat; and she will dwell with her mother-in-law.
{3:1} And Naomi her mother-in-law will say to her My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it shall be well to thee?
{3:2} And now is not Boaz from our acquaintance of whom thou wert with his maidens? Behold him winnowing the threshing-floor of barley this night.
{3:3} And wash thou and anoint thyself, and put thy garments upon thee, and go down to the threshing-floor: thou shalt not make thyself known to the man till his finishing to eat and to drink.
{3:4} And it will be in his lying down, and know thou the place where he shall lie down there, and go in and uncover from his feet, and lie down; and he will announce to thee what thou shalt do.
{3:5} And she will say to her, All that thou shalt say to me, I will do.
{3:6} And she will go down to the threshing-floor and she will do according to all that her mother-in-law commanded her.
{3:7} And Boaz will eat and drink, and his heart will be done good to; and he will go to lie down upon the end of the heap: and she will come secretly and she will uncover from his feet, and lie down.
{3:8} And it will be in the middle of the night, and the man will be terrified: and he will turn and behold a woman lying from his feet.
{3:9} And he will say, Who art thou? And she will say, I am Ruth thy servant: and spread thy wing over thy servant, for thou a blood relation.
{3:10} And he will say, Blessed thou to Jehovah, my daughter: thou didst make good thy mercy at the last more than the beginning, so that thou wentest not after the young men, if poor and if rich.
{3:11} And now, my daughter, thou shalt not fear; all which thou shalt say, I will do to thee: for all the gate of my people will know that thou art a woman of power.
{3:12} And now that truly if I a blood relation: and also there is a blood relation nearer than I.
{3:13} Lodge this night, and it being in the morning, if he will redeem thee, good; he shall redeem: and if he desire not to redeem thee, and I redeemed thee, Jehovah lives: lie down till morning.
{3:14} And she will lie down from his feet till Morning: and she will rise before a man shall recognize his neighbor. And he will say, It shall not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.
{3:15} And he will say, Bring me the upper garment which is upon thee, and hold fast upon it. And she will hold fast upon it, and he will measure six of barley, and he will place upon her: and he will go to the city.
{3:16} And she will come to her mother-in-law, and she will say, Who art thou, my daughter? And she will announce to her all that the man did to her.
{3:17} And she will say, These six of barley he gave to me; for he said, Thou shalt not go empty to thy mother-in-law.
{3:18} And she will say, Sit, my daughter, till thou shalt know how the word will fall: for the man will not rest till he finished the word this day.
{4:1} And Boaz went up to the gate and sat there: and behold, the blood relation whom Boaz spake of, passing by; and he will say, Turn aside, sit down here; thou such a one. And he will turn aside, and sit down.
{4:2} And he will take ten men from the old men of the city, and he will say, Sit ye down here. And they will sit down.
{4:3} And he will say to the blood relative, The portion of the field which was to our brother Elimelech, Naomi turning back from the field of Moab, sells:
{4:4} And I said, I will reveal to thine ear, saying, Buy before the inhabitants, and before the old men of my people. If thou wilt redeem, redeem: and if thou wilt not redeem, announce to me, and I shall know: for none besides thee to redeem; and I after thee; and he will say, I will redeem.
{4:5} And Boaz will say, In the day of thy buying the field from the hand of Naomi, and from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, thou boughtest it to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
{4:6} And the near relative will say, I shall not be able to redeem for me, lest I shall destroy my inheritance: redeem to thyself; thou the near relative: for I shall not be able to redeem.
{4:7} And this before in Israel upon redemption and upon exchange, to set up all the word; a man drew off his shoe and gave to his neighbor: and this the precept in Israel.
{4:8} And the blood relative will say to Boaz, Buy for thee. And he will draw off his shoe.
{4:9} And Boaz will say to the old men and all the people, Ye are witnesses this day that I bought all which was to Elimelech, and all which was to Chilion and Mahlon, from the hand of Naomi.
{4:10} And also Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I bought to me for a wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance; and the name of the dead shall not be cut off from his brethren and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.
{4:11} And all the people which are in the gate will say, and the old men, Witnesses. Jehovah will give the woman coming into thy house as Rachel and as Leah, which they two built up the house of Israel: and make thou power in Ephratah, and call a name in the house of bread.
{4:12} And thy house shall be as the house of Pharez which Tamar bare to Judah, from the seed which Jehovah shall give to thee from this maiden.
{4:13} And Boaz will take Ruth, and she will be to him for a wife: and he will come in to her, and Jehovah will give to her conception, and she will bring forth a son.
{4:14} And the women will say to Naomi, Blessed be Jehovah who caused not to cease to thee a blood relation this day; and his name shall be called in Israel.
{4:15} And being to thee for the turning back the soul, and to nourish thy gray hairs: for thy daughter-in-law who loved thee brought him forth; for she is good to thee above seven sons.
{4:16} And Naomi will take the child and put him in her bosom, and she will be to him for nurse.
{4:17} And the neighbors will call to him a name, saying, A son was born to Naomi; and they will call his name Obed: he the father of Jesse, the father of David.
{4:18} And these the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
{4:19} And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Aminadab,
{4:20} And Aminadab begat Nashon, and Nashon begat Salmon,
{4:21} And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
{4:22} And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.
