{1:1} And Jehovah will call to Moses, and speak to him from the tent of appointment, saying,
{1:2} Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, A man when he shall bring near from you an offering to Jehovah, from the cattle, from the oxen and from the sheep, ye shall bring near your offering.
{1:3} If a burnt-offering, his sacrifice from the oxen, a blameless male: they shall bring it near to the door of the tent of appointment; he shall bring it near according to his will before Jehovah.
{1:4} And he placed his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering, and it was accepted for him to expiate for him.
{1:5} And he slaughtered the son of the cow before Jehovah: and the sons of Aaron the priests brought near the blood, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about, which is at the door of the tent of appointment.
{1:6} And he flayed the burnt-offering, and cut in pieces according to its pieces.
{1:7} And the sons of Aaron, the priests, gave fire upon the altar, and arranged the wood upon the fire.
{1:8} And Aaron's sons, the priests, shall arrange the pieces, the head and the fat, upon the wood which is upon the fire which is upon the altar.
{1:9} And its bowels and its legs he shall wash in water: and the priest burnt all upon the altar, a burnt-offering a sacrifice, an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
{1:10} And if from the sheep his offering, from the lambs, or from the goats, for a burnt-offering; a blameless male he shall bring it near.
{1:11} And he slaughtered it upon the thigh of the altar, northward before Jehovah: and Aaron's sons, the priests, sprinkled his blood upon the altar round about.
{1:12} And he cut it in pieces, according to its pieces, and his head and his fat: and the priest arranged them upon the wood which is upon the fire which is upon the altar:
{1:13} And the bowels and the legs he shall wash in water: and the priest shall bring near all, and burn upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering, a sacrifice, an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
{1:14} And if from the birds he brought near a burnt-offering to Jehovah, and he brought near from the turtle-doves, or from the sons of the dove his offering,
{1:15} And the priest brought it near to the altar, and broke off the head, and burnt upon the altar: and pressed out its blood upon the wall of the altar.
{1:16} And he took away the crop with its feathers, and cast it at the side of the altar eastward, at the place of the ashes.
{1:17} And he cleft it with its wings; he shall not divide; and the priest burnt it upon the altar, upon the wood which is upon the fire: it is a burnt-offering, a sacrifice, an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
{2:1} And when a soul shall bring near an offering, a gift to Jehovah, his offering shall be fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and give frankincense upon it.
{2:2} And he brought it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he pressed together from it his hand full from its fine flour, and from its oil, upon all its frankincense, and the priest burnt its memorial upon the altar, a sacrifice, an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
{2:3} And the remainder from the gift, to Aaron and his sons; holy of holies from the sacrifice to Jehovah.
{2:4} And when thou shalt bring an offering, a gift, a baking of the oven, fine flour of unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and thin unleavened cakes anointed with oil.
{2:5} And if a gift upon the frying pan their offering, fine flour mingled with oil, unleavened it shall be.
{2:6} Break it to bits and pour oil upon it: it is a gift.
{2:7} And if a gift of the pot thine offering, fine flour with oil it shall be made.
{2:8} And bring the gift which shall be made from these to Jehovah: and bring it near to the priest, and he brought it near to the altar.
{2:9} And the priest lifted up from the gift its memorial, and burnt upon the altar: a sacrifice, an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
{2:10} And the remainder from the gift for Aaron and for his sons: holy of holies, from the sacrifices to Jehovah.
{2:11} Every gift which ye shall bring near to Jehovah shall not be made leavened: for all leaven and all honey ye shall not burn from it a sacrifice to Jehovah.
{2:12} The offering of the first fruits ye shall bring them near to Jehovah: and to the altar they shall not go up for an odor of sweetness.
{2:13} And every offering of thy gift, thou shalt salt with salt; and thou shalt not cause the salt of the covenant of thy God to cease from thy gift: upon every offering of thine thou shalt bring near salt.
{2:14} And if thou shalt bring near a gift of the first fruits to Jehovah, green ears parched in the fire, grits of early grain crushed shalt thou bring near, the gift of thy first fruits.
{2:15} And give oil upon it and put frankincense upon: it is a gift.
{2:16} And the priest burnt its memorial from its crushing and from its oil, upon all its frankincense: a sacrifice to Jehovah.
{3:1} And if his offering a sacrifice of peace, if from the oxen he is bringing near, if a male, if a female, blameless shall he bring it near before Jehovah.
{3:2} And he placed his hand upon the head of his offering, and slaughtered it at the door of the tent of appointment: and Aaron's sons the priests sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
{3:3} And he brought from the sacrifice of peace a sacrifice to Jehovah; the fat covering the bowels, and all the fat which is upon the bowels,
{3:4} And the two kidneys, and the fat which is upon them, which is upon the loins, and the lobe upon the liver, upon the kidneys, he shall take away.
{3:5} And Aaron's sons burnt it upon the altar, upon the burnt-offering which is upon the wood, which is upon the fire: a sacrifice, an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
{3:6} And if from the sheep his offering for a sacrifice of peace to Jehovah, a male or a female, blameless he shall bring it.
{3:7} If he is bringing a lamb his offering, he brought it before Jehovah.
{3:8} And he placed his hand upon the head of his offering, and slaughtered it before the tent of appointment. And the sons of Aaron sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
{3:9} And he brought from the sacrifice of peace a sacrifice to Jehovah: its fat of, the whole fat tail, with the back bone, shall he take it away; and the fat covering the bowels, and all the fat which is upon the bowels,
{3:10} And the two kidneys, and the fat which is upon them, which is upon the loins, and the lobe upon the liver, upon the kidneys, he shall take it away.
{3:11} And the priest burnt it upon the altar: the bread of the sacrifice to Jehovah.
{3:12} And if a goat his offering, and he offered it before Jehovah.
{3:13} And he placed his hand upon his head and slaughtered it before the tent of appointment: and Aaron's sons sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
{3:14} And he brought from it his offering, a sacrifice to Jehovah; the fat covering the bowels, and all the fat which is upon the bowels,
{3:15} And the two kidneys, and the fat which is upon them, which is upon the loins, and the lobe upon the liver, upon the kidneys, he will take it away.
{3:16} And the priest burnt them upon the altar; the bread of the sacrifice for an odor of sweetness: all the fat to Jehovah.
{3:17} A law forever to your generations in all your dwellings, all the fat and all the blood, ye shall not eat.
{4:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{4:2} Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, When a soul shall sin in error from all the commands of Jehovah which shall not be done, and doing from after any of them:
{4:3} If the priest being anointed shall sin according to the guilt of the people; and he brought for his sin which he sinned, a bullock, the son of a cow, blameless to Jehovah for the sin.
{4:4} And he brought the bullock to the door of the tent of appointment, before Jehovah; and he placed his hand upon the head of the bullock, and slaughtered the bullock before Jehovah.
{4:5} And the priest being anointed, took the blood of the bullock, and brought it to the tent of appointment.
{4:6} And the priest dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkled from the blood seven times before Jehovah, before the vail of the holy place.
{4:7} And the priest gave from the blood upon the horns of the altar of the incense of aromatics before Jehovah, which is in the tent of appointment; and all the blood of the bullock he shall pour out at the foundation of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of appointment.
{4:8} And all the fat of the bullock of the sin, he shall lift up from it: the fat covering over the bowels, and all the fat which is upon the bowels.
{4:9} And the two kidneys, and the fat which is upon them, which is upon the loins, and the lobe upon the liver, upon the kidneys, he shall take it away,
{4:10} As it shall be lifted up from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace: and the priest burnt them upon the altar of burnt-offering.
{4:11} And the skin of the bullock and all its flesh with its head and with its legs, and its bowels and its dung,
{4:12} And he brought forth all the bullock to from without the camp to a clean place, to the pouring out of the ashes, and burnt it upon the wood in fire: upon the pouring out of the ashes it shall be burnt.
{4:13} And if all the assembly of Israel shall err, and the word was hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they did behind from the commands of Jehovah, which shall not be done, and they were guilty,
{4:14} And the sin which they sinned against it being known, and the assembly brought a bullock, the son of a cow, for the sin, and they brought it before the tent of appointment.
{4:15} And the old men of the assembly placed their hands upon the head of the bullock before Jehovah: and slaughtered the bullock before Jehovah.
{4:16} And the priest being anointed brought the blood of the bullock to the tent of appointment.
{4:17} And the priest dipped his finger from the blood and sprinkled seven times before Jehovah, before the vail.
{4:18} And from the blood he will give upon the horns of the altar, which is before Jehovah in the tent of appointment, and he shall pour out all the blood at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of appointment.
{4:19} And he shall lift up all the fat from it, and he burnt it upon the altar.
{4:20} And he did to the bullock as he did to the bullock of sin, thus he did to it; and the priest shall expiate for them, and it was forgiven to them.
{4:21} And he brought forth the bullock from without the camp, and he burnt it as he burnt the first bullock: it is the sin of the assembly:
{4:22} When a chief shall sin, and do one from all the commands of Jehovah his God, which he shall not do in erring, and being guilty,
{4:23} Or his sin being made known to him while he sinned in it; and he brought his offering, a he goat of the goats, a blameless male.
{4:24} And he placed his hand upon the head of the goat, in the place where he shall slaughter the burnt-offering before Jehovah: it is sin.
{4:25} And the priest took from the blood of the sin with his finger, and gave upon the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, and he shall pour out the blood at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering.
{4:26} And all the fat he shall burn upon the altar as the fat of the sacrifice of peace: and the priest expiated for him from his sin, and it was forgiven to him.
{4:27} And if one shall sin from the people of the land in erring, in doing one from the commands of Jehovah which shall not be done, and being guilty;
{4:28} Or his sin being made known to him which he sinned: and he brought a she goat of the goats, a blameless female for his sin which he sinned.
{4:29} And he placed his hand upon the head of the sin, and he slaughtered the sin in the place of the burnt-offering.
{4:30} And the priest took from its blood with his finger, and gave upon the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering; and all the blood he will pour out at the foundation of the altar.
{4:31} And all the fat he will take away, as the fat shall be taken away from the sacrifice of peace; and the priest burnt upon the altar, for an odor of sweetness to Jehovah: and the priest shall expiate for him, and it shall be forgiven to him.
{4:32} And if he shall bring a lamb his offering for sin, a blameless female shall he bring.
{4:33} And he placed his hand upon the head of the sin, and slaughtered it for sin, in the place where he will slaughter the burnt-offering.
{4:34} And the priest took from the blood of the sin with his finger, and gave upon the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering; and all its blood he will pour out at the foundation of the altar.
{4:35} And all the fat he shall take away, as the fat of the lamb from the sacrifice of peace shall be taken away; and the priest burnt them upon the altar for sacrifices of Jehovah: and the priest expiated for him for his sin which he sinned, and it was forgiven to him.
{5:1} And when a soul shall sin, and he heard the voice of an oath, and he a witness, if he saw or knew; if he shall not announce, he bore his sin.
{5:2} Or when a soul shall touch upon any unclean thing, if upon a carcase of an unclean beast, or upon the carcase of unclean cattle, or upon the carcase of an unclean creeping thing, and it was hidden from him: and he is unclean and guilty.
{5:3} Or when he shall touch upon the uncleanness of man, for all uncleanness which he shall be unclean in it, and it was hidden from him; and he shall know, and be guilty.
{5:4} Or when a soul shall swear to talk idly with his lips for evil, or for good, for all which the man shall talk idly with an oath, and it was hid from him; and he shall know, and be guilty for one from these.
{5:5} And it was when he shall be guilty for one from these, and he shall confess that he sinned upon it.
{5:6} And he brought his trespass to Jehovah for his sin which he sinned, a female from the sheep, a lamb or she goat of the goats, for the sin; and the priest expiated for him from his sin,
{5:7} And if his hand shall not reach the sufficiency of a sheep, and he brought his trespass which he sinned, two turtledoves, or two sons of a dove, to Jehovah; one for the sin, and one for the burnt-offering.
{5:8} And he brought them to the priest, and he brought near that for the sin first, and broke off its head from the front of its neck; and he shall not divide.
{5:9} And he sprinkled from the blood of the sin upon the wall of the altar; and that remaining of the blood he shall press out at the foundation of the altar: it is sin.
{5:10} And the second he shall make a burnt-offering according to the judgment: and the priest expiated for him from his sin which he sinned, and it was forgiven to him.
{5:11} And if his hand shall not reach to the two turtle-doves, or to the two sons of a dove; and he brought his offering who sinned, the tenth of the ephah of fine flour for the sin; he shall not put oil upon it, and he shall not give frankincense upon it; for it is sin.
{5:12} And he brought it to the priest, and the priest pressed from it his hand full, its memorial, and burnt upon the altar for sacrifices to Jehovah: it is sin.
{5:13} And the priest shall expiate for him for his sin which he sinned, from one from these; and it was forgiven to him: and it was to the priest for a gift.
{5:14} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{5:15} When a soul shall cover transgression and sin in erring from the holy things of Jehovah; and he brought his trespass to Jehovah, a blameless ram from the sheep, by thy estimation of shekels of silver, by the shekel of the holy place, for the trespass.
{5:16} And what he sinned from the holy place he shall recompense, and he shall add its fifth upon it, and he gave it to the priest: and the priest shall expiate for him with the ram of the trespass, and it was forgiven to him.
{5:17} And if a soul shall sin and do one from all the commands of Jehovah which shall not be done; and he knew not, and he was guilty, and bore his sin.
{5:18} And he brought a blameless ram from the sheep, by thy estimation, for the trespass to the priest; and the priest expiated for him for his error which he erred and he knew not; and it was forgiven to him.
{5:19} It is guilt: being guilty, he trespassed to Jehovah.
{6:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{6:2} When a soul shall sin and cover a transgression against Jehovah, and lie against his neighbor in a deposit, or in trust of the hand, or in robbery, or oppressing his neighbor;
{6:3} Or he found the lost thing, and lied concerning it, and swore upon falsehood; upon one of all which the man will do, for sinning in them.
{6:4} And it was when he shall sin and being guilty, and he turned back the robbery which he robbed, or the oppression which he oppressed, or the deposit which was deposited with him, or the lost thing which he found,
{6:5} Or from all which he shall swear upon it for falsehood; and he recompensed it in its head, and he shall add its fifth part upon it, and he shall give it to whom it is to him, in the day of his trespass.
{6:6} And he shall bring his trespass to Jehovah, a blameless ram from the sheep by thy estimation, for the trespass, to the priest.
{6:7} And the priest expiated for him before Jehovah; and it was forgiven to him for one from all which he shall do for being guilty in it.
{6:8} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{6:9} Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This the law of the burnt-offering: it is the burnt-offering upon its burning upon the altar all the night till the morning; and the fire of the altar shall burn upon it.
{6:10} And the priest put on his garment of thread, and his drawers of thread he shall put upon his flesh, and he took up the ashes which the fire shall consume, with the burnt-offering upon the altar, and he put it beside the altar.
{6:11} And he put off his garments and put on other garments, and brought forth the ashes without the camp, to a clean place.
{6:12} And the fire upon the altar shall burn in it; and it shall not go out: and the priest burnt wood upon it in the morning, in the morning, and he arranged upon it the burnt-offering; and burnt upon it the fat of the peace.
{6:13} The fire shall always burn upon the altar; it shall not go out.
{6:14} And this the law of the gift: the sons of Aaron bringing it before Jehovah, before the altar.
{6:15} And he took up from it his handful from the fine flour of the gift, and from its oil, and all the frankincense which is upon the gift, and he burnt upon the altar, an odor of sweetness, a remembrance to Jehovah.
{6:16} And the remainder from it Aaron and his sons shall eat: unleavened shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the enclosure of the tent of appointment they shall eat it.
{6:17} It shall not be cooked leavened. I gave it their portion from my sacrifices. It is holy of holies, as the sin and the trespass.
{6:18} Every male of the sons of Aaron shall eat it A law forever for your generations, from the sacrifices of Jehovah; all which touch upon them shall be holy.
{6:19} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{6:20} This the offering of Aaron and his sons, which they shall bring to Jehovah, in the day of anointing him; the tenth of the ephah of fine flour a perpetual gift, its half in the morning and its half in the evening.
{6:21} Upon a frying-pan with oil it shall be made; being dipped, thou shalt bring it in the cookings of the gift, in bits thou shalt bring near, an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
{6:22} And the priest being anointed, of his sons, instead of him shall do it: a law forever to Jehovah: it shall be wholly burnt.
{6:23} And every gift of the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.
{6:24} And Jehovah will speak to Moses saying,
{6:25} Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This the law of the sin: in the place where the burnt-offering shall be slaughtered, the sin shall be slaughtered before Jehovah: it is holy of holies.
{6:26} The priest offering it for sin, shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the enclosure of the tent of appointment.
{6:27} Every one touching upon its flesh shall be consecrated: and when shall be sprinkled from its blood upon his garment, what shall be sprinkled upon it thou shalt wash in the holy place.
{6:28} And the earthen vessel in which it shall be boiled, shall be broken: and if it was boiled in a brass vessel, it was scoured and washed in water.
{6:29} Every male among the priests shall eat it: it is holy of holies.
{6:30} And all sin, the blood of which shall be brought into the tent of appointment to expiate in the holy place, shall not be eaten: it shall be burnt in fire.
{7:1} This the law of the trespass: it is holy of holies.
{7:2} In the place where they shall slaughter the burnt-offering they shall slaughter the trespass: and he shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about.
{7:3} And he shall bring from it all its fat; the fat tail, and the fat covering the bowels,
{7:4} And the two kidneys, and the fat which is upon them, which is upon the loins, and the lobe upon the liver, with the kidneys, he shall take it away.
{7:5} And the priest burnt them upon the altar, a sacrifice to Jehovah: it is a trespass.
{7:6} Every male among the priests shall eat it: in the holy place it shall be eaten: it is holy of holies.
{7:7} As the sin, so the trespass: one law for them: the priest who shall expiate upon it, to him it shall be.
{7:8} And the priest bringing near a man's burnt-offering, the skin of the burnt-offering which was brought near for the priest, to him it shall be.
{7:9} And every gift which shall be baked in an oven, and all being done in a pot and upon the frying-pan, to the priest bringing it, to him it shall be.
{7:10} And every gift mixed with oil, and dry, to all the sons of Aaron it shall be, each as his brother.
{7:11} And this the law of the sacrifice of peace which he shall bring to Jehovah.
{7:12} If for praise he shall bring it, and he brought with the sacrifice of praise, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and thin unleavened cakes anointed with oil, and fine flour dipped, cakes mixed in oil.
{7:13} With the cakes, leavened bread he shall bring, an offering upon the sacrifice of praise of his peace.
{7:14} And he brought from it one from all the offering an oblation to Jehovah, for the priest sprinkling the blood of peace, to him it shall be.
{7:15} And the flesh of the sacrifice of praise of his peace, in the day of his offering shall be eaten; he shall not leave from it till morning.
{7:16} And if a vow or a voluntary gift, the sacrifice of his offering in the day he brought it, his sacrifice it shall be eaten; and from the morrow that remaining from it shall be eaten.
{7:17} And the remainder from the flesh of the sacrifice in the third day shall be burnt in fire.
{7:18} And if eating, he shall eat from the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace in the third day, it shall not be accepted; he bringing it near, it shall not be imputed to him: it shall be an abomination, and the soul eating from it shall bear its iniquity.
{7:19} And the flesh which shall touch upon any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt in fire: and of all clean flesh, the flesh shall be eaten.
{7:20} And the soul which shall eat the flesh of the sacrifice of peace which to Jehovah, and his uncleanness upon him, that soul was cut off from its people.
{7:21} And when a soul shall touch upon anything unclean, upon the uncleanness of man, or upon unclean cattle, or upon any abominable unclean thing, and eat from the flesh of the sacrifice of peace, which is to Jehovah, that soul was cut off from its people.
{7:22} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{7:23} Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Any fat of ox, and lamb, and goat, ye shall not eat.
{7:24} And the fat of a carcass, and the fat of the torn in pieces shall be worked for all work; and eating, ye shall not eat it.
{7:25} For every one eating the fat from the cattle that will be brought from it, a sacrifice to Jehovah, and the soul eating was cut off from its people.
{7:26} And any blood ye shall not eat in any of your dwellings, of fowl, and of cattle.
{7:27} Every soul which shall eat any blood, and that soul was cut off from its people.
{7:28} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{7:29} Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, He bringing near the sacrifice of his peace to Jehovah, shall brine his offering to Jehovah from the sacrifice of his peace.
{7:30} His hands shall bring the sacrifices of Jehovah: the fat upon the breast he shall bring it, the breast to lift it up a waving before Jehovah.
{7:31} And the priest burnt the fat upon the altar: and the breast was to Aaron and to his sons.
{7:32} And the right leg ye shall give an oblation to the priest from the sacrifices of your peace.
{7:33} And he bringing near the blood of the peace, and the fat, from the sons of Aaron, to him shall be the right leg for a portion.
{7:34} For the breast of the waving and the leg of the oblation, I took from the sons of Israel from the sacrifices of peace, and I will give them to Aaron the priest, and to his sons for a law forever, from the sons of Israel.
{7:35} This the anointing of Aaron and of his sons from the sacrifices of Jehovah, in the day of bringing them to be priests to Jehovah;
{7:36} Which Jehovah commanded to give to them in the day of his anointing them from the sons of Israel, a law forever to their generations.
{7:37} This the law of the burnt-offering, for the gift, and for the sin, and for the trespass, and for the fulness, and for the sacrifice of the peace;
{7:38} Which Jehovah commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day of his commanding the sons of Israel to bring near their offerings to Jehovah, in the desert of Sinai.
{8:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{8:2} Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the oil of anointing, and a bullock of the sin, and two rams, and a basket of the unleavened;
{8:3} And gather together all the assembly to the door of the tent of appointment.
{8:4} And Moses will do as Jehovah commanded him: and the assembly will be gathered together to the door of the tent of appointment.
{8:5} And Moses will say to the assembly, This the word which Jehovah commanded to do.
{8:6} And Moses will bring near Aaron and his sons, and will wash them in water.
{8:7} And he will give upon him the tunic, and he will gird him with the girdle, and he will put upon him the robe, and will give upon him the ephod, and will gird him with the girdle of the ephod, and will gird on him with it.
{8:8} And he will put upon him the breast-plate: and will give to the breastplate the Lights and the Truth.
{8:9} And he will put the turban upon his head; and he will put upon the turban, at the front of his face, the brightness of gold, the holy diadem, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
{8:10} And Moses will take the oil of anointing, and will anoint the dwelling and all which is in it, and he will consecrate them.
{8:11} And he will sprinkle from it upon the altar seven times, and anoint the altar and all its vessels, and the wash-basin, and its foot, to consecrate them.
{8:12} And he will pour out from the oil of anointing upon the head of Aaron, and anoint him to consecrate him.
{8:13} And Moses will bring near the sons of Aaron, and he will put tunics upon them, and he will gird on them with the girdle and he will bind to them caps; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
{8:14} And he will bring near the bullock of sin: and Aaron and his sons will place their hands upon the head of the bullock of sin.
{8:15} And he will slaughter; and Moses will take the blood and give upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and he will purify the altar, and he will sour out the blood at the foundation of the altar, and he will consecrate it to expiate upon it.
{8:16} And he will take all the fat which upon the bowels, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses will burn upon the altar.
{8:17} And the bullock and his skin, and his flesh, and his dung, he burnt in fire without the camp, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
{8:18} And he will bring the ram of the burnt-offering: and Aaron and his sons will place their hands upon the head of the ram.
{8:19} And he will slaughter, and Moses will sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
{8:20} And he cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses will burn the head and the pieces, and the fat.
{8:21} And the bowels and the legs he washed in water; and Moses will burn all the ram upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering for an odor of sweetness; it is a sacrifice to Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
{8:22} And he will bring the second ram, the ram of the filling up: and Aaron and his sons will place their hands upon the head of the ram.
{8:23} And he will slaughter, and Moses will take from its blood, and will give upon the extremity of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
{8:24} And he will bring near Aaron's sons, and Moses will give from the blood upon the extremity of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right feet: and Moses will sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
{8:25} And he will take the fat and the fat tail, and all the fat which is upon the bowels, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and the right leg:
{8:26} And from the basket of unleavened which is before Jehovah he took one unleavened cake and a cake of bread of oil, and one thin cake, and he will put upon the fat and upon the right leg:
{8:27} And he will give the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and he shall lift them up a waving before Jehovah.
{8:28} And Moses will take them from their hands and burn upon the altar upon the burnt-offering: they fillings up for an odor of sweetness: it is a sacrifice to Jehovah.
{8:29} And Moses will take the breast and will lift it up; a waving before Jehovah: from the ram of the fillings up it was to Moses for a portion; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
{8:30} And Moses will take from the oil of anointing, and from the blood which is upon the altar, and will sprinkle upon Aaron, upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and will consecrate Aaron and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
{8:31} And Moses will say to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of appointment; and there ye shall eat it, and the bread which is in the basket of the fillings up, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
{8:32} And the remainder of the flesh and of the bread ye shall burn in fire.
{8:33} And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of appointment, seven days, till the day of filling up the days of your fillings up: for seven days shall he fill your hands.
{8:34} As he did in this day, Jehovah commanded to do, to expiate for you.
{8:35} And at the door of the tent of appointment shall ye sit day and night seven days, and watch the watches of Jehovah, and ye shall not die: for so I was commanded.
{8:36} And Aaron did and his sons all the word which Jehovah commanded by the hand of Moses.
{9:1} And it shall be in the eighth day, Moses called to Aaron and to his sons, and to the old men of Israel.
{9:2} And he will say to Aaron, Take to thee a calf, the son of a cow, for sin, and a blameless ram for a burnt offering, and bring before Jehovah.
{9:3} And to the sons of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a he goat of the goats for sin; and a calf and a lamb, sons of a year, blameless, for a burnt-offering;
{9:4} And a bullock and a ram for peace, for a sacrifice before Jehovah; and a gift mingled in oil: for the day of Jehovah was seen to you.
{9:5} And they shall take what Moses commanded before the tent of appointment: and all the assembly shall draw near and stand before Jehovah.
{9:6} And Moses will say, This the word which Jehovah commanded ye shall do: and the glory of Jehovah shall be seen to you.
{9:7} And Moses will say to Aaron, Draw near to the altar and do thy sin, and thy burnt-offering, and expiate for thyself, and for the people: and do the offering of the people, and expiate for them; as Jehovah commanded.
{9:8} And Aaron shall draw near to the altar and slaughter the calf for sin, which is to him.
{9:9} And Aaron's sons will bring the blood to him, and he will dip his finger in the blood, and give upon the horns of the altar, and he will pour out the blood at the foundation of the altar.
{9:10} And the fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe from the liver, from the sin, he burnt upon the altar; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
{9:11} And the flesh and the skin he burnt in fire without the camp.
{9:12} And he will slaughter the burnt-offering; and the sons of Aaron will bring the blood to him, and they will sprinkle it upon the altar round about.
{9:13} And the burnt-offering they brought to him according to its pieces, and the head: he will burn upon the altar.
{9:14} And he will wash the bowels, and the legs, and he will burn upon the burnt-offering upon the altar.
{9:15} And he will bring the offering of the people, and take the he goat of the sin which to the people, and he will slaughter it and purify it as the first.
{9:16} And he will bring the burnt-offering, and do according to judgment.
{9:17} And he will bring the gift, and fill his hand from it, and burn upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning.
{9:18} And he will slaughter the bullock, and the ram of the sacrifice of peace, which is for the people: and the sons of Aaron will bring the blood to him, and he will sprinkle it upon the altar round about.
{9:19} And the fat from the bullock, and from the ram, the fat tail and the covering, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver:
{9:20} And they will put the fat upon the breasts, and he will burn the fat upon the altar.
{9:21} And the breasts, and the right leg, Aaron lifted up a waving before Jehovah; as Moses commanded.
{9:22} And Aaron will lift up his hand to the people, and bless them; and come down from the doing the sin, and the burnt-offering, and the peace.
{9:23} And Moses will go in, and Aaron, to the tent of appointment, and they will come forth and they will bless the people: and the glory of Jehovah will be seen to all the people.
{9:24} And fire will come forth from before Jehovah, and will consume upon the altar the burnt-offering, and the fat: and they will shout and fall upon their faces.
{10:1} And Nadab and Abihu, sons of Aaron, will take each his censer, and give in them fire, and put upon it incense, and bring before Jehovah strange fire, which he commanded them not.
{10:2} And fire will come forth from before Jehovah, and will consume them, and they will die before Jehovah.
{10:3} And Moses will say to Aaron, This which Jehovah spake, saying, In drawing near me I will be consecrated, and before all the people I will be honored. And Aaron will be silent.
{10:4} And Moses will call to Mishael and to Elzaphan, sons of Uzziel, Aaron's uncle, and say to them, Draw near; lift up your brethren from before the holy place, to without the camp.
{10:5} And they will draw near and lift them up in their tunics to without the camp; as Moses spake.
{10:6} And Moses will say to Aaron, and to Eleazar, and to Ithamar, his sons, Ye shall not uncover you heads, and ye shall not rend your garments; and ye shall not die, and there shall be anger upon all the assembly: and your brethren, all the house of Israel shall weep for the burning which Jehovah burnt.
{10:7} And from the door of the tent of appointment ye shall not go forth, lest ye shall die: for the oil of anointing of Jehovah is upon you. And they will do according to the word of Moses.
{10:8} And Jehovah will speak to Aaron, saying.
{10:9} Wine and strong drink thou shalt not drink, thou and thy sons with thee, in your going in to the tent of appointment; and ye shall not die: a law forever to your generations.
{10:10} And to separate between the holy and between the unholy, and between the unclean and between the clean:
{10:11} And to teach the sons of Israel all the laws which Jehovah spake to them by the hand of Moses.
{10:12} And Moses will speak to Aaron, and to Eleazar, and to Ithamar, his sons being left, Take ye the gift remaining from the sacrifices of Jehovah, and eat it unleavened by the altar: for it is holy of holies.
{10:13} And eat it in the holy place, for it is thy portion, and thy sons' portion from the sacrifices of Jehovah: for thus I was commanded.
{10:14} And the breast of waving and the leg of oblation ye shall eat in a clean place; thou and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee; for it is thy portion and the portion of thy sons; they were give from the sacrifices of peace of the sons of Israel.
{10:15} The leg of oblation, and the breast of waving upon the sacrifices of the fat shall they bring, to lift up a waving before Jehovah; and it was to thee, and to thy sons with thee, for a law forever; as Jehovah commanded.
{10:16} And the he goat of the sin, seeking, Moses sought, and behold, it was burnt: and he will be angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, Aaron's sons, being left, saying,
{10:17} Wherefore ate ye not the sin in the holy place? for it is holy of holies, and he gave it to you to lift up the iniquity of the assembly, and to expiate for them before Jehovah.
{10:18} Behold, he brought not its blood to the holy place before it: eating, ye shall eat it in the holy place as I was commanded.
{10:19} And Aaron will speak to Moses saying, Behold, this day they offered their sin and their burnt-offering, before Jehovah; and behold, such as these will befall me: and I ate the sin this day will it be good in the eyes of Jehovah?
{10:20} And Moses will hear and it will be good in his eyes.
{11:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,
{11:2} Speak to the sons of Israel, saying These the beasts which ye shall eat from all the cattle which are upon the earth.
{11:3} All cleaving the cloven hoof, and splitting, split the cloven hoof, and lifting up rumination among the cattle, ye shall eat it.

{12:2} Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, When a woman shall bear seed and bring forth a male, and she was unclean seven days: according to the days of removal of being sick she shall be unclean.
{12:3} And in the eighth day the flesh of his uncircumcision shall be circumcised.
{12:4} And thirty days and three days, she shall sit down in the blood of purification: she shall not touch upon any holy thing, and into the holy place she shall not come till the completing of the days of her purification.
{12:5} And if she shall bear a female, and she was unclean two sevens, as her removal: and sixty days and six days she shall sit down upon the blood of her purification.
{12:6} And in completing the days of her purification, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb, the son of his year, for a burnt-offering, and the son of a dove, or a turtle-dove, for the sin, to the door of the tent of appointment, to the priest.
{12:7} And he offered it before Jehovah, and expiated for her, and cleansed her from the flowing of her blood. This the law of the bringing forth for a male, or for a female.
{12:8} And if her hand shall not find the sufficiency of a sheep, and she took two turtle-doves or two sons of the dove; one for a burnt-offering, and one for sin: and the priest expiated for her, and she was clean.
{13:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, and to Aaron, saying,
{13:2} When to a man there shall be a lifting up in the skin of his flesh, or a scab, or brightness, and it was in the skin of his flesh for the stroke of leprosy; and he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests.
{13:3} And the priest saw the stroke in the skin of the flesh: and the hair in the stroke turned white, and the sight of the stroke deep from the skin of his flesh, it is the stroke of leprosy: and the priest saw him and defiled him.
{13:4} And if the brightness it white in the skin of his flesh, and its sight not deep from the skin, and the hair not turned white; and the priest shut up the stroke seven days.
{13:5} And the priest saw him in the seventh day: and behold, the stroke stood; in his eyes, the stroke spread not in the skin, and the priest shut him up the second seven days.
{13:6} And the priest saw him in the seventh day, the second time, and behold, the stroke dim, and the stroke spread not in the skin, and the priest cleansed him: it is a scab: and he washed his garments and was clean.
{13:7} And if spreading, the scab shall spread in the skin, after his being seen to the priest for his cleansing, and he was seen the second time to the priest.
{13:8} And the priest saw, and behold, the scab spread in the skin, and the priest defiled him: it is leprosy.
{13:9} When the stroke of leprosy shall be in a man, and he shall be brought to the priest:
{13:10} And the priest saw, and behold, a lifting up white in the skin, and it turned the hair white, and the quickening of living flesh in the lifting up:
{13:11} It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall defile him; he shall not shut him up for he is unclean.
{13:12} And if breaking out, the leprosy shall break out in the skin, and the leprosy covered all the skin, the stroke from his head and even to his feet, to all the sight of the eyes of the priest:
{13:13} And the priest saw, and behold, the leprosy covered all his flesh, and he cleansed the stroke: all of it turned white: he is clean.
{13:14} In the day of seeing in him the living flesh, he shall be unclean.
{13:15} And the priest saw the living flesh, and he defiled him: the living flesh it is unclean: it is leprosy.
{13:16} Or when the living flesh shall turn back and turn to white, he shall be brought to the priest.
{13:17} And the priest saw him, and behold, the stroke turned to white; and the priest cleansed the stroke: he is clean.
{13:18} And when the flesh shall be in it, in his skin, a burning sore, and was healed,
{13:19} And there was in the place of the burning sore a white rising, or brightness, white, reddish, and he was seen to the priest;
{13:20} And the priest saw, and behold, the sight low from the skin, and its hair turned white: and the priest defiled him: it is the stroke of leprosy broken out in the burning sore.
{13:21} And if the priest shall see it, and behold, no white hair in it, and it not low from the skin, and it was dim; and the priest shut him up seven days:
{13:22} And if spreading, it shall spread in the skin, and the priest defiled him: it the stroke.
{13:23} And if the brightness shall stand still, lowest, spreading not, it the scar of the burning sore; and the priest cleansed him.
{13:24} Or when there shall be flesh in his skin a burning of fire, and there was a quickening of the burning, a brightness reddish white, or white;
{13:25} And the priest saw it, and behold, the hair in the brightness was turned white, and the sight was deep from the skin; it leprosy in the burning broken out: and the priest defiled him: it the stroke of leprosy.
{13:26} And if the priest shall see it, and behold, no white hair in the burning, and it not being low from the skin, and it was dim; and the priest shut him up seven days.
{13:27} And the priest saw him in the seventh day: if spreading, it shall spread in the skin, and the priest shall defile him: it the stroke of leprosy.
{13:28} And if the brightness shall stand still, the lowest, spreading not in the skin, and it was dim; it a rising of the burning, and the priest cleansed him: for it a scar of the burning.
{13:29} And when a man or woman there shall be in him a stroke upon the head, or in the beard;
{13:30} And the priest saw the stroke, and behold, its sight deep from the skin, and in it thin, yellow hair; and the priest defiled him: it a scall, it a leprosy of the head, or of the beard.
{13:31} And when the priest shall see the stroke of the scall, and behold, its sight not deep from the skin, and no black hair in it; and the priest shut up the stroke of the scall seven days.
{13:32} And the priest saw the stroke in the seventh day: and behold, the scab spread not, and there was no yellow hair in it, and the sight of the scall not deep from the skin;
{13:33} And he was shaved, and the scall he shall not shave, and the priest shut up the scall seven days the second time.
{13:34} And the priest saw the scall in the seventh day, and behold, the scall spread not in the skin, and its sight not deep from the skin; and the priest cleansed him; and he washed his garments and was clean.
{13:35} And if spreading, the scall shall spread in the skin after his purification;
{13:36} And the priest saw him: and behold, the scall spread in the skin, the priest shall not search for yellow hair; he is unclean.
{13:37} And if in his eyes the scall stood still, and black hair sprang up in it, the scall was healed; he is clean: and the priest cleansed him.
{13:38} And when a man or woman shall be in the skin of their flesh a brightness, a white brightness;
{13:39} And the priest saw, and behold, in the skin of their flesh a brightness, a dim white; it is a white scurf breaking out in the skin: he is clean.
{13:40} And if a man when his head shall become bald, he being bald; he is clean.
{13:41} And if from the side of his face his head shall become bald, he is bald; he is clean.
{13:42} And when there shall be in his baldness behind, or in his baldness in front, a stroke, reddish white, it is a leprosy broken out in his baldness behind, or in his baldness in front.
{13:43} And the priest saw it, and behold, the rising of the stroke, a reddish white, in his baldness behind, or in his baldness in front, as the sight of leprosy, in the skin of the flesh;
{13:44} He a leprous man, he unclean: he being unclean the priest shall defile him; his stroke in his head.
{13:45} And the leprous in whom the stroke, his garments shall be rent, and his head shall be uncovered, and upon the lips he shall be covered, and he shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
{13:46} All the days which the stroke is in him, he shall be unclean: he is unclean: he shall dwell separately; without the camp is his dwelling.
{13:47} When a garment the stroke of leprosy shall be in it, whether in the garment of wool or in the garment of linen;
{13:48} Or in the warp, or in the woof, to the linen or to the wool: or in the skin, or in any work of skin:
{13:49} And the stroke was greenish, or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any vessel of skin; it is the stroke of leprosy, and it was seen to the priest.
{13:50} And the priest saw the stroke, and shut up the stroke seven days.
{13:51} And he saw the stroke in the seventh day: when the stroke spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, and all which made of skin for work; the stroke a painful leprosy; it unclean.
{13:52} And he burnt the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or in wool, or in linen, or any vessel of skin which shall be in it the stroke: for it a painful leprosy; in fire shall it be burnt.
{13:53} And if the priest shall see, and behold, the stroke spread not in the garment, or in the warp or in the woof, or in any vessel of skin;
{13:54} And the priest commanded, and they washed that in which was the stroke, and he shut it up seven days, the second time.
{13:55} And the priest saw after the washing, the stroke, and behold, the stroke turned not its eye, and the stroke spread not; it unclean; in fire thou shalt burn it; it a hollow in his baldness behind, or in his baldness in front.
{13:56} And if the priest saw, and behold, the stroke dim after washing it: he rent it out of the garment or from the skin, or from the warp, or from the woof.
{13:57} And if it shall be seen still in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any vessel of skin; it is breaking out: in the fire thou shalt burn it, that in which is the stroke.
{13:58} And the garment, or the warp or the woof, or any vessel of skin which thou shalt wash, and the stroke departed from them, and it was washed the second time, and it was clean.
{13:59} This the law of the stroke of leprosy of the garment of wool, or of linen, or the warp or the woof, or every vessel of skin, to cleanse it or to defile it.
{14:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{14:2} This shall be the law of the leprous in the day of his cleansing: he was brought to the priest.
{14:3} And the priest shall go forth without the camp: and the priest saw, and behold, the stroke of leprosy was healed from the leprous.
{14:4} And the priest commanded, and took for him being cleansed, two clean living birds, and cedar wood, and double scarlet, and hyssop.
{14:5} And the priest commanded, and killed one of the birds into a vessel of earthen, over living water.
{14:6} The living bird he will take it, and the cedar wood and the double scarlet, and the hyssop, and he dipped them and the living bird in the blood of the bird slain over the living water.
{14:7} And he sprinkled upon him, being cleansed from the leprosy, seven times and cleansed him, and he sent forth the living bird upon the face of the field.
{14:8} And he being cleansed, washed his garments and shaved all his hair, and washed in water and was clean: and afterwards he shall come into the camp and dwelt without his tent seven days.
{14:9} And it was in the seventh day, he shall shave all his hair off his head, and his beard, and the front of his eyes; and all his hair shall he shave off; and he washed his garments, and washed his flesh in water, and was clean.
{14:10} And in the eighth day he shall take two blameless lambs, and one blameless ewe lamb, the daughter of her year, and three tenths of fine flour, a gift mingled with oil, and one measure of oil.
{14:11} And the priest cleansing, made the man being cleansed stand, and the things, before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of appointment.
{14:12} And the priest took one he lamb and brought him near for trespass, and the measure of oil, and lifted them up, a waving before Jehovah.
{14:13} And he slaughtered the lamb in the place where he shall slaughter the sin and the burnt-offering, in the holy place: for as the sin the trespass, it is to the priest; it is the holy of holies.
{14:14} And the priest took from the blood of the trespass, and the priest gave upon the extremity of the right ear of him being cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
{14:15} And the priest took from the measure of oil, and poured upon the priest's left hand.
{14:16} And the priest dipped his right finger from the oil which upon his left hand, and he sprinkled from the oil with his finger, seven times before Jehovah.
{14:17} And from the remainder of the oil which was upon his hand, the priest will give upon the extremity of the right ear of hint being cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass.
{14:18} And that remaining of the oil which was upon the priest's hand, he will give upon the head of him being cleansed, and the priest expiated for him before Jehovah.
{14:19} And the priest did the sin, and expiated for him being cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterwards he will slaughter the burnt-offering.
{14:20} And the priest brought up the burnt-offering and the gift upon the altar: and the priest expiated for him, and he was cleansed.
{14:21} And if he be poor, and his hand attaining not; and he took one lamb a trespass, for a waving to expiate for him, and one tenth of fine flour mingled with oil, for the gift, and a measure of oil.
{14:22} And two turtle-doves, or two sons of the dove, which his hand shall attain; and one was the sin, and one the burnt-offering.
{14:23} And he brought them in the eighth day for his cleansing, to the priest at the door of the tent of appointment before Jehovah.
{14:24} And the priest took the lamb of the trespass and the measure of oil, and the priest lifted them up, a waving before Jehovah.
{14:25} And he slaughtered the lamb of the trespass, and the priest took from the blood of the trespass, and gave upon the extremity of the right ear of him being cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:
{14:26} And from the oil the priest poured out upon the priest's left hand.
{14:27} And the priest sprinkled with his right finger from the oil which was upon his left hand, seven times, before Jehovah.
{14:28} And the priest gave from the oil which was upon his hand, upon the extremity of the right ear of him being cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass.
{14:29} And that remaining from the oil which was upon the priest's hand, he will give upon the head of him being cleansed; and he expiated for him before Jehovah.
{14:30} And he did the one from the turtle-doves, or from the sons of the dove, from what his hand shall attain.
{14:31} What his hand shall attain, the one the sin, and the one the burnt-offering upon the gift. And the priest expiated for him being cleansed, before Jehovah.
{14:32} This the law of him in whom the stroke of leprosy, which his hand attained not in his cleansing.
{14:33} And Jehovah will speak to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
{14:34} When ye shall come into the land of Canaan which I give to you for a possession, and I gave the stroke of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;
{14:35} And he to whom is the house, came and announced to the priest, saying, It was seen to me as a stroke in the house.
{14:36} And the priest commanded, and they cleared the house, before the priest shall go in to see the stroke, and all which is in the house shall not be unclean; and after this the priest shall go in to see the house.
{14:37} And he saw the stroke; and behold, the stroke in the walls of the house, the hollows greenish, or reddish and their sight low from the wall.
{14:38} And the priest shall go forth from the house to the door of the house, and he shut up the house seven days.
{14:39} And the priest turned back in the seventh day, and saw, and behold, the stroke spread in the walls of the house.
{14:40} And the priest commanded, and they took away the stones which in them was the stroke, and they cast them without the city into an unclean place.
{14:41} And he shall scrape the house from within round about, and they poured out the dust which they scraped off without the city, into an unclean place.
{14:42} And they took other stones and brought instead of these stones; and he shall take other clay and spread over the house.
{14:43} And if the stroke shall turn back and break out in the house after he took away the stones, and after he scraped off the house, and after it was spread over;
{14:44} And the priest came and saw, and behold, the stroke spread in the house; it a painful leprosy in the house: it is unclean.
{14:45} And he tore down the house, and its stones, and its wood, and all the dust of the house: and he brought forth without the city, into an unclean place.
{14:46} And he coming in to the house all the days it is shut up, shall be unclean till the evening.
{14:47} And he lying in the house shall wash his garments: and he eating in the house shall wash his garments.
{14:48} And if the priest coming in, shall come in and see, and behold, the stroke spread not in the house after spreading over the house: and the priest cleansed the house, for the stroke was healed.
{14:49} And he took to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and double scarlet, and hyssop.
{14:50} And he slaughtered the one bird into a vessel of earthen, over living water.
{14:51} And he took the cedar wood, and the hyssop and the double scarlet, and the living bird, and dipped them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the living water, and sprinkled into the house seven times.
{14:52} And he cleansed the house with the blood of the bird in living water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the double scarlet.
{14:53} And he sent away the living bird without the city to the face of the field, and he expiated for the house: and it was clean.
{14:54} This the law for every stroke of leprosy and for scall,
{14:55} And for the leprosy of a garment, and for a house,
{14:56} And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a brightness;
{14:57} And to teach in the day of being unclean, and in the day of cleansing: this the law of leprosy.
{15:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
{15:2} Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When a man, a man, there shall be a flowing from his flesh, his flowing unclean.
{15:3} And this shall be his uncleanness in his flowing: his flesh running with his flowing, or his flesh sealed up from his flowing, it is his uncleanness.
{15:4} Every bed which he flowing shall lie upon it, shall be unclean: and every vessel which he shall sit upon it, shall be unclean.
{15:5} And a man who shall touch upon his bed, shall cleanse his garments and shall wash in water, and be unclean till evening.
{15:6} And he sitting upon a vessel which he flowing, shall sit upon it, shall cleanse his garments, and wash in water, and shall be unclean till the evening.
{15:7} And he touching upon the flesh of him flowing, shall wash his garments, and wash in water, and shall be unclean till the evening.
{15:8} And if he flowing shall spit upon the clean; and he washed his garments, and washed in water, and was unclean till the evening.
{15:9} And every seat which he flowing shall ride upon it, shall be unclean.
{15:10} And every one touching upon any thing which shall be under him, shall be unclean till the evening: and he lifting up these things, shall wash his garments, and he washed in water, and was unclean till the evening.
{15:11} And every one which he flowing shall touch upon him (and washed not his hands in water), he washed his garments, and washed in water and was unclean till the evening.
{15:12} And the vessel of earthen which he flowing shall touch upon it, shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be washed in water.
{15:13} And when he flowing shall be cleansed from his flowing, and he numbered to him seven days for his cleansing, and he washed his garments and washed his flesh in living water, and was clean.
{15:14} And in the eighth day he shall take to him two turtle-doves, or two sons of the dove, and he came before Jehovah at the door of the tent of appointment, and he gave them to the priest.
{15:15} And the priest did them, one a sin and the one a burnt-offering; and the priest expiated for him before Jehovah from his flowing.
{15:16} And a man, when the effusion of seed shall go forth from him, and he washed in water all his flesh, and was unclean till the evening.
{15:17} And every garment and every akin, which shall be upon it the effusion of seed, and it was washed in water, and was unclean till the evening.
{15:18} And a woman whom a man shall lie with her, with the effusion of seed, and they washed in water, and were unclean till the evening.
{15:19} And when a woman, shall be flowing, and her flowing shall be blood in her flesh, seven days shall she be in her uncleanness: and all touching upon her shall be unclean till the evening.
{15:20} And every thing which she shall lie upon it in her uncleanness, shall be unclean: and every thing which she shall sit upon it shall be unclean.
{15:21} And every one touching upon her bed shall wash his garments; and he washed in water and was unclean till the evening.
{15:22} And every one touching upon any vessel which she shall sit upon it, shall wash his garments, and he washed in water and was unclean till evening.
{15:23} And if it is upon the bed or upon the vessel which she sat upon it, in his touching upon it he shall be unclean till the evening.
{15:24} And if lying down a man shall lie with her and her uncleanness shall be upon him, and he was unclean seven days: and every bed which he shall lie upon, it shall be unclean.
{15:25} And when a woman shall flow a flowing of her blood many days out of the time of her uncleanness, or when she shall flow upon her uncleanness; all the days of the flowing from her uncleanness shall be as the days of her uncleanness: she shall be unclean.
{15:26} Every bed which she shall lie upon it all the days of her flowing, shall be to her as the bed of her uncleanness; and every vessel which she shall sit upon it shall be unclean, as the impurity of her uncleanness.
{15:27} And every one touching upon them shall be unclean, and he washed his garments, and washed in water, and was unclean till the evening.
{15:28} And if she was cleansed from her flowing, and she numbered to her seven days, and afterward she shall be clean.
{15:29} And in the eighth day she shall take to her two turtle-doves, or two sons of the dove, and she brought them to the priest to the door of the tent of appointment.
{15:30} And the priest did the one a sin, and the one a burnt-offering; and the priest expiated for her, before Jehovah, from the flowing of her uncleanness.
{15:31} And ye winnowed the sons of Israel from their uncleanness; and they shall not die in their uncleanness in defiling my dwelling which is in the midst of you.
{15:32} This the law of him flowing, and of whom the effusion of seed shall go forth from him, to be defiled in it:
{15:33} And of her being sick in her uncleanness, and of him flowing his flowing; for the male, and for the female, and for the man who shall lie with her being unclean.
{16:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, in their bringing near before Jehovah, and they shall die.
{16:2} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Speak to Aaron thy brother, and he shall not come in every time into the holy place within the vail at the face of the cover which is upon the ark; and he shall not die for I will be seen in the cloud upon the cover.
{16:3} In this shall Aaron come in to the Holy Place, with a bullock, the son of a cow, for sin, and a ram for a burnt-offering.
{16:4} The holy linen tunic shall be put on, and the linen drawers shall be upon his flesh, and with a linen girdle shall he be girded, and with a linen turban shall he be wound round: these the holy garments; and he washed his flesh in water and put them on.
{16:5} And from the assembly of the sons of Israel he shall take two he goats of the goats for sin, and one ram for a burnt-offering.
{16:6} And Aaron brought near the bullock of sin, which was to him, and he expiated for himself and for his house.
{16:7} And he took the two he goats and made them stand before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of appointment.
{16:8} And Aaron gave lots upon the two he goats; one lot for Jehovah, and one lot for the goat set apart.
{16:9} And Aaron brought the he goat which upon it came up the lot for Jehovah, and he did it for the sin.
{16:10} And the he goat which upon it came up the lot for the goat set apart, shall stand living before Jehovah, to expiate upon him, to send him for a goat set apart to the desert.
{16:11} And Aaron brought near the bullock of the sin, which was to him, and he expiated for himself, and for his house, and he slaughtered the bullock of the sin which was to him.
{16:12} And he took a fire pan full of coals of fire from the altar from before Jehovah, and he filled his hands with incense of aromatics beaten small, and brought within the vail:
{16:13} And he gave the incense upon the fire before Jehovah, and the cloud of incense covered the vail which was upon the testimonies; and he shall not die.
{16:14} And he took from the blood of the bullock, and sprinkled with his finger upon the face of the cover eastward, and before the cover he shall sprinkle seven times from the blood with his finger.
{16:15} And he slaughtered the he goat of the sin which was for the people, and he brought its blood within the vail, and he did its blood as he did to the blood of the bullocks; and he sprinkled it upon the cover and before the cover.
{16:16} And he expiated for the holy place from the uncleanness of the sons of Israel, and from their transgression for all their sins: and so shall he do for the tent of appointment, dwelling with them in the midst of their uncleanness.
{16:17} And no man shall be in the tent of appointment in his coming in to expiate in the holy place, till his coming out, he expiated for himself and for his house, and for all the convocation of Israel.
{16:18} And he went forth to the altar which is before Jehovah and expiated upon it; and he took from the blood of the bullock, and from the blood of the he goat, and gave upon the horns of the altar round about.
{16:19} And he sprinkled upon it from the blood round about with his finger, seven times, and cleansed it, and consecrated it, from the uncleanness of the sons of Israel.
{16:20} And he finished expiating the holy place, and the tent of appointment, and the altar, and he brought the living he goat.
{16:21} And Aaron placed his two hands upon the head of the living he goat and confessed over him all the iniquities of the sons of Israel, and all their transgressions, and all their sins, and gave them upon the head of the he goat, and sent by the hand of a fit man to the desert.
{16:22} And the he goat lifted up upon him all their iniquities to a desert land: and he sent the he goat into the desert.
{16:23} And Aaron shall come to the tent of appointment, and he put off the garments of linen which he put on in his going in to the holy place, and he left them there.
{16:24} And he washed his flesh in water in the holy place, and he put on his garments and came forth, and did his burnt-offering, and the burnt-offering of the people, and expiated for himself, and for the people.
{16:25} And the fat of the sin he shall burn upon the altar.
{16:26} And he sending away the goat set apart, shall wash his garments and wash his flesh in water, and after this he shall go in to the camp.
{16:27} And the bullock of sin and the he goat of sin, from which he brought their blood to expiate in the holy place, he shall bring forth to without the camp, and they shall burn in fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.
{16:28} And he burning them shall wash his clothes and wash his flesh in water, and after this he shall come in to the camp.
{16:29} And it was to you for a law forever: in the seventh month, in the tenth of the month ye shall humble your souls, and all work ye shall not do, the native and the stranger sojourning in the midst of you.
{16:30} For in that day he shall expiate for you, to cleanse you from all your sins: before Jehovah shall ye be clean.
{16:31} And this is a Sabbath of Sabbath to you, and ye humbled your souls, a law forever.
{16:32} And the priest expiated whom he shall anoint and whose hand he shall fill, to be priest instead of his father: and he put on the garments of linen of the holy place.
{16:33} And he expiated the holy of holy, and the tent of appointment, and the altar shall he expiate: and for the priests, and for all the people of the convocation, shall he expiate.
{16:34} And this was to you for a law forever to expiate for the sons of Israel, from all their sins once in a year: and he will do as Jehovah commanded Moses.
{17:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{17:2} Speak to Aaron and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them, This the word which Jehovah commanded, saying,
{17:3} A man, a man from the house of Israel, who shall slaughter an ox or lamb or goat, in the camp, or who shall slaughter without the camp,
{17:4} And at the door of the tent of appointment brought it not in to bring near an offering to Jehovah before the dwelling of Jehovah, blood shall be reckoned to that man: he shed blood; and that man was cut off from the midst of his people:
{17:5} So that the sons of Israel shall bring their sacrifices which they sacrificed upon the face of the field, and they brought them to Jehovah at the door of the tent of appointment, to the priest, and they sacrificed them, sacrifices of peace to Jehovah.
{17:6} And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of Jehovah, at the door of the tent of appointment; and he burnt the fat for an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
{17:7} And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to satyrs with whom they committed fornication after them: this shall be to them a law forever to their generations.
{17:8} And thou shalt say to them, A man, a man from the house of Israel, and from the stranger who shall sojourn in the midst of you, who shall bring up a burnt-offering or a sacrifice,
{17:9} And at the door of the tent of appointment brought it not to do it to Jehovah; and that man was cut off from his people.
{17:10} And a man, a man from the house of Israel, and from the stranger sojourning in the midst of you, who shall eat any blood; and I gave my face against the soul eating the blood, and I cut it off from the midst of its people.
{17:11} For the soul of the flesh it is in the blood; and I gave it to you upon the altar to expiate for your souls: for the blood shall expiate for the soul.
{17:12} For this I said to the sons of Israel, Every soul from you shall eat no blood, and the stranger sojourning in the midst of you shall not eat blood.
{17:13} And a man, a man from the sons of Israel, and from the stranger sojourning in the midst of you, who shall hunt a hunting, a beast or bird which shall be eaten, and he poured out its blood and covered it with dust.
{17:14} For the soul of all flesh it is its blood in its soul: and say to the sons of Israel, The blood of all flesh ye shall not eat, for the soul of all flesh it is its blood: all eating it shall be cut off.
{17:15} And every soul which shall eat a carcass and torn in pieces among the native or the stranger, and he washed his garments and washed in water, and was unclean till the evening: and he was clean.
{17:16} And if he shall not wash his garments, and bathe not his flesh, and he shall bear his iniquity.
{18:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{18:2} Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, I am Jehovah your God.
{18:3} According to the doings of the land of Egypt where ye dwelt in it, ye shall not do: and according to the doings of the land of Canaan where I brought you there, ye shall not do: and in their laws ye shall not go.
{18:4} My judgments shall ye do, and my laws shall ye watch to go in them; am Jehovah your God.
{18:5} And ye watched my laws and my judgments, which a man shall do them, and he lived in them: I am Jehovah.
{18:6} A man, a man to any remainder of his flesh ye shall not come near to uncover nakedness: I am Jehovah.
{18:7} The nakedness of thy father, and the nakedness of thy mother thou shalt not uncover: it is thy mother, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
{18:8} The nakedness of thy father's wife thou shalt not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness.
{18:9} The nakedness of thy sister, daughter of thy father or daughter of thy mother, born within or born without, thou shalt not uncover their nakedness.
{18:10} The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, thou shalt not uncover their nakedness, for theirs is thy nakedness.
{18:11} The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father (she is thy sister), thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
{18:12} The nakedness of thy father's sister, thou shalt not uncover: she is thy father's remainder.
{18:13} The nakedness of thy mother's sister thou shalt not uncover, for she thy mother's remainder.
{18:14} The nakedness of thy father's brother thou shalt not uncover: to his wife thou shalt not draw near; she is thine aunt.
{18:15} The nakedness of thy daughter-in-law thou shalt not uncover: she is thy son's wife, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
{18:16} The nakedness of thy brother's wife thou shalt not uncover: it is thy brother's nakedness.
{18:17} The nakedness of a woman and her daughter thou shalt not uncover; her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, thou shalt not take to uncover her nakedness; they are her remainder; it is wickedness.
{18:18} And a wife to her sister thou shalt not take to press to uncover her nakedness with her, in her living.
{18:19} And to a woman in the impurity of her uncleanness, thou shalt not come near, to uncover her nakedness.
{18:20} To thy neighbor's wife thou shalt not give thy effusion of seed to be defiled with her.
{18:21} And from thy seed thou shalt not give to pass over to Molech, and thou shalt not profane the name of thy God: I am Jehovah.
{18:22} And with a male thou shalt not lie on a woman's bed: it is abomination.
{18:23} And to any quadruped thou shalt not give thy bed, to be defiled with it: and a woman shall not stand before a quadruped, to lie with it: it is profanation.
{18:24} Ye shall not be defiled in any of these, for in all these the nations were defiled which I send out from your face.
{18:25} And the land shall be defiled: and I will strike iniquity upon it, and the land shall vomit forth its inhabitants.
{18:26} And ye watched these my laws, and my judgments, and ye shall not do from all of these abominations, the native and the stranger sojourning in your midst:
{18:27} For all these abominations did the men of the land which were before you, and the land shall be defiled.
{18:28} And the land shall not vomit you forth in your defiling it, as it vomited forth the nations which were before you.
{18:29} For every one which shall do from all of these abominations, and the souls doing were cut off from the midst of their people.
{18:30} And they watched my watches so as not to do from the laws of abomination which were done before you, and ye shall not be defiled in them: I am Jehovah your God.
{19:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{19:2} Speak to the assembly of the sons of Israel, and say to them, Ye shall be holy, for I Jehovah your God am holy.
{19:3} Ye shall fear each his mother and his father, and my Sabbaths ye shall watch: I am Jehovah your God.
{19:4} Ye shall not turn to vain things, and molten gods ye shall not make to yourselves: I am Jehovah your God.
{19:5} And when ye shall sacrifice a sacrifice of peace to Jehovah, ye shall sacrifice at your will.
{19:6} In the day of your sacrifice it shall be eaten, and on the morrow: and that remaining till the third day shall be burnt in fire.
{19:7} And if eating, it shall be eaten in the third day, it is abomination; it shall not be accepted.
{19:8} And he eating it shall bear his iniquity, for he profaned the holy thing of Jehovah; and that soul was cut off from its people.
{19:9} And in your reaping the harvest of your land thou shalt not finish to reap the extremity of thy field, and thou shalt not gather the gleaning of thy harvest.
{19:10} And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, and the scattering of thy vineyard thou shalt not glean; to the poor and to the stranger thou shalt leave them: I am Jehovah your God.
{19:11} Ye shall not steal and ye shall not deceive, and ye shall not lie each to his neighbor.
{19:12} And ye shall not swear in my name for falsehood, and profane the name of thy God: I Jehovah.
{19:13} Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor, and thou shalt not rob: the wages of the hireling shall not remain with thee till morning.
{19:14} Thou shalt not curse the deaf, and before the blind thou shalt not give a stumbling block, and thou shalt fear thy God: I Jehovah.
{19:15} Ye shall not do evil in judgment; thou shalt not take up the face of the poor; thou shalt not reverence the face of the great: in justice shalt thou judge thy neighbor.
{19:16} Thou shalt not go a slanderer among thy people; thou shalt not stand upon the blood of thy neighbor: I Jehovah.
{19:17} Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: rebuking, thou shalt rebuke thy neighbor, and thou shalt not take sin upon him.
{19:18} Thou shalt not avenge thyself nor keep anger with the sons of thy people, and didst love thy neighbor as thyself. I Jehovah.
{19:19} My laws shall ye watch: thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with two diverse kinds: thy field thou shalt not sow with two diverse kinds; and a garment of two diverse kinds (of linen and woolen) shall not come upon thee.
{19:20} And when a man shall lie with a woman with effusion of seed, and she a maid-servant betrothed to a man, and not redeemed by ransoming, and freedom not given to her, there shall be a punishment: they shall not die because she was not free.
{19:21} And he brought his trespass to Jehovah, to the door of the tent of appointment, a ram of trespass.
{19:22} And the priest expiated for him with the ram of the trespass, before Jehovah, for his sin which he sinned; and his sin which he sinned was forgiven to him.
{19:23} And when ye shall come into the land, and ye planted every tree of food, and ye made uncircumcised in its uncircumcision its fruits: three years it shall be to you uncircumcised: it shall not be eaten.
{19:24} And in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy praises for Jehovah.
{19:25} And in the fifth year ye shall eat its fruits, to add to you its produce. I Jehovah your God.
{19:26} Ye shall not eat with the blood: ye shall not take auguries, and ye shall not practise magic.
{19:27} Ye shall not cut the extremities of your head, and thou shalt not destroy the extremities of thy beard.
{19:28} And ye shall not give an incision for the soul in your flesh, and a mark of stigma ye shall not give upon you: I Jehovah.
{19:29} Thou shalt not profane thy daughter to commit fornication: and the land commit fornication and the land was filled with wickedness.
{19:30} My Sabbaths shall ye watch, and ye shall be afraid of my holies: I Jehovah.
{19:31} Ye shall not turn to necromancers, and to wizards ye shall not seek, to be defiled by them: I Jehovah your God.
{19:32} From the face of gray hair thou shalt rise up, and thou shalt honor the face of the old man, and thou shalt be afraid of thy God: I Jehovah.
{19:33} And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not oppress him.
{19:34} As the native among you shall be to you the stranger sojourning with you; thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I Jehovah your God.
{19:35} Ye shall not do evil in judgment, in tribute, in weight, and in measure.
{19:36} Just balances, just stones, a just ephah, and a just hin shall be to you: I Jehovah your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
{19:37} And ye watched all my laws and all my judgments, and did them: Jehovah.
{20:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{20:2} And to the sons of Israel thou shalt say, A man, a man from the sons of Israel, and from the stranger sojourning in Israel which shall give of his seed to Molech, dying, he shall die: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
{20:3} And I will give my face against that man and cut him off from the midst of his people; for he gave from his seed to Molech, in order to defile my holy place and to profane my holy name.
{20:4} And if the people of the land, hiding, shall hide their eyes from that man in his giving his seed to Molech, so as not to put him to death;
{20:5} And I set my face against that man and against his family, and I cut him off, and all committing fornication after him to commit fornication after Molech, from the midst of their people.
{20:6} And the soul which shall turn to necromancers and to wizards, to commit fornication after them, and I gave my face against that soul and I cut him off from the midst of his people.
{20:7} And ye were consecrated and ye were holy: for I Jehovah your God.
{20:8} And ye watched my laws, and ye did them: I Jehovah consecrating you.
{20:9} When a man, a man who shall lightly esteem his father and his mother, dying, he shall die: he lightly esteemed ha father and his mother: his blood is upon him.
{20:10} And a man who shall commit adultery with a man's wife, who shall commit adultery with his friend's wife, dying, he shall die, the adulterer and the adulteress.
{20:11} And a man who shall lie with his father's wife, uncovered his father's nakedness: dying, they shall die: they two their blood is upon them,
{20:12} And a man who shall lie with his daughter-in-law, dying, they shall die, they two: they did profanation; their blood is upon them.
{20:13} And a man who shall lie with a male in a woman's bed, they did abomination: they two, dying, shall die; their blood is upon them.
{20:14} A man who shall take a woman and her mother, it wickedness: in fire they shall be burnt, he and they: and there shall not be wickedness in the midst of you.
{20:15} And a man who shall give his bed with a quadruped, dying, he shall die: and ye shall kill the quadruped.
{20:16} And a woman who shall come near to any quadruped to lie down with it, and didst thou kill the woman and the quadruped; dying, they shall die; their blood is upon them.
{20:17} And a man who shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and he saw her nakedness, and she shall see his nakedness; it is a reproach; and they were cut off in the eyes of the sons of their people; he uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.
{20:18} And a man who shall lie with a woman being sick, and uncovered her nakedness; he made naked her fountain, and she uncovered the fountain of her blood: and they two were cut off from the midst of their people.
{20:19} And the nakedness of thy mother's sister, and of thy father's sister, thou shalt not uncover; for he made naked his remainder; they shall bear their iniquity.
{20:20} And a man who shall lie with his aunt, uncovered the nakedness of his uncle: they shall bear their sin: they shall die childless.
{20:21} And a man who shall take his brother's wife, it is uncleanness: he uncovered his brother's nakedness: they shall die childless.
{20:22} And ye watched all my laws, and all my judgments, and did them: and the land shall not vomit you forth, which I brought you there to dwell in it.
{20:23} And ye shall not walk in the laws of the nations which I sent out from before you: for they did all these things and I shall be disgusted with them.
{20:24} And I said to you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to inherit it, a land flowing with milk and honey: I Jehovah your God, who separated you from the nations.
{20:25} And ye separated between clean cattle to unclean, and between unclean birds and clean: and ye shall not make you souls abhorred by cattle or bird, and by any which shall creep upon the earth which I separated to you for unclean.
{20:26} And, ye were holy to me: for I Jehovah am holy, and I will separate you from the nations to be to me.
{20:27} When a man or a woman shall be among them a necromancer, or a wizard, dying, they shall die: with stone shall they stone them: their blood is upon them.
{21:1} And Jehovah will say to Moses, Say to the priests the sons of Aaron, and say to them, for the soul he shall not be defiled among his peoples.
{21:2} But if for his remainder coming near to him, for his mother and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,
{21:3} And for his sister, a virgin, coming near to him, who was not for a husband for her, he shall be defiled.
{21:4} A chief among his people shall not be defiled, to profane himself.
{21:5} With baldness, they shall not make baldness upon their head, and they shall not shave the extremity of their beard: and in their flesh they shall not cut incisions.
{21:6} They shall be holy to their God, and profane not the name of their God: for the sacrifices of Jehovah, and the bread of their God they bring: and they were holy.
{21:7} They shall not take a woman, a harlot, or profane; and they shall not take a wife driven away from her husband, for he is holy to his God.
{21:8} And he consecrated him, for he bringing the bread of thy God: holy shall he be to thee: for I Jehovah consecrating you am holy,
{21:9} And the daughter of a man a priest, if she shall be profaned to commit fornication, it is profaning her father: she shall be burnt in fire.
{21:10} And the great priest from his brethren which the anointing oil shall be poured upon his head, and he filled his hand to put on the garments, his head he shall not uncover, and his garments he shall not rend.
{21:11} And to an dead soul he shall not come, for his father, and for his mother, he shall not be defiled.
{21:12} And from the holy place he shall not go forth, and he shall not profane the holy place of his God; for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him I Jehovah.
{21:13} And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
{21:14} A widow, and the driven away, and profane, and an harlot, those he shall not take: but a virgin of his people shall he take a wife.
{21:15} And he shall not profane his seed among his people; for I Jehovah consecrating him.
{21:16} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{21:17} Speak to Aaron saying, A man from thy seed according to their generations, to whom shall be in him a blemish, shall not come near to bring the bread of his God.
{21:18} For every man to whom in him a blemish shall not come near: a man blind, or lame, or flat-nosed, or stretched out,
{21:19} Or a man to whom there shall be in him a broken foot or a broken hand,
{21:20} Or curved, or withered, or stained in his eye, or scurvy, or scabby, or a bruised testicle:
{21:21} Any man to whom in him a blemish from the seed of Aaron the priest, shall not come near to bring the sacrifices of Jehovah: a blemish is in him, the bread of his God he shall not come near to bring.
{21:22} The bread of his God the holy of holies, and from the holies shall he eat.
{21:23} But he shall not come in to the vail, and to the altar he shall not come near, for a blemish is in him; and he shall not profane my holy place: for I Jehovah consecrating them.
{21:24} And Moses will speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel.
{22:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{22:2} Speak to Aaron and to his sons, and they shall separate themselves from the holies of the sons of Israel, and they shall not profane my holy name which they consecrate to me: I Jehovah.
{22:3} Say to them, For your generations every man who shall come near from all your seed to the holies which the sons of Israel: shall consecrate to Jehovah, and his uncleanness upon him, and that soul was cut off from before me: I Jehovah.
{22:4} A man, a man from the seed of Aaron, and he leprous or flowing; he shall not eat of the holies till he shall be clean. And he touching upon any unclean soul, or a man which shall go forth from him the effusion of seed;
{22:5} Or a man who shall touch upon any creeping thing which shall be unclean to him, or upon a man who shall be unclean to him for all his uncleanness;
{22:6} The soul which shall touch upon it, and it shall be unclean till the evening, and he shall not eat from the holies, except he washed his flesh in water.
{22:7} And the sun went down and he was clean; and afterwards he shall eat from the holies for it is his bread.
{22:8} A carcass or torn of wild beast, he shall not eat to be defiled with it: I Jehovah.
{22:9} And they watched my watches, and they bore not sin upon it, and they died when they profaned it: I Jehovah consecrating them.
{22:10} And any stranger shall not eat the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest and a hireling shall not eat the holy thing.
{22:11} And when the priest shall buy a soul, the purchase of his silver, he shall eat of it, and they born in his house; they shall eat from his bread.
{22:12} And if the priest's daughter shall be for a man, a stranger, she shall not eat from the offering of the holies.
{22:13} And when the daughter of the priest shall be a widow, or driven out, and no seed to her, and she turned back to her father's house as in her youth, she shall eat from her father's bread; and any stranger shall not eat of it.
{22:14} And when a man shall eat the holy thing in error, and he shall add its fifth upon it, and give the holy thing to the priest.
{22:15} And they shall not profane the holies of the sons of Israel which they shall lift up to Jehovah;
{22:16} And for them to take up the sin of trespass in their eating the holies: for I Jehovah consecrating them.
{22:17} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying.
{22:18} Speak to Aaron and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them, A man, a man from the house of Israel and from the stranger in Israel, who shall bring near his offering, for all their vows, and for all their willing gifts which they will offer to Jehovah for a burnt-offering:
{22:19} For your acceptance a blameless male among the cattle, among the sheep, and among the goats.
{22:20} And every one which in it is a blemish ye shall not bring it: for it shall not be for acceptance for you.
{22:21} And when a man shall bring a sacrifice of peace to Jehovah, to separate a vow or a willing gift in cattle or in sheep, it shall be blameless for acceptance: not any blemish shall be in it.
{22:22} Blind, or broken, or cut, or flowing, or scurvy, or scabby, they shall not bring these to Jehovah, and a sacrifice ye shall not give from them upon the altar to Jehovah.
{22:23} And an ox, and a sheep stretched out, and contracted, thou shalt do it a voluntary gift; and for a vow it shall not be accepted.
{22:24} And the bruised, and the smitten, and the torn, and the cut, ye shall not bring to Jehovah, and ye shall not do in your land.
{22:25} And from the hand of the son of the stranger ye shall not bring near the bread of your God from all these, because their destruction is in them; a blemish in them; they shall not be accepted for you.
{22:26} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{22:27} When a calf or lamb, or goat, shall be brought forth, it shall be seven days under its mother; and from the eighth day and beyond, it shall be accepted for an offering, a sacrifice to Jehovah.
{22:28} And an ox or a sheep, it and its son, thou shalt not slaughter in one day.
{22:29} And when ye shall sacrifice a sacrifice of praise to Jehovah, ye shall sacrifice for your acceptance.
{22:30} In that day it shall be eaten; ye shall not leave from it till morning: I Jehovah.
{22:31} And ye watched my commands and did them: I Jehovah.
{22:32} And ye did not profane my holy name; I was consecrated in the midst of the sons of Israel: I Jehovah consecrating you.
{22:33} Having brought you forth from the land of Egypt to be to you for God: I Jehovah.
{23:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying to,
{23:2} Speak the sons of Israel and say to them, The appointments of Jehovah, which ye shall call them holy callings, these my appointments.
{23:3} Six days shall work be done; the seventh day a Sabbath of rest, a holy calling: ye shall not do any work: it is a Sabbath to Jehovah in all your dwellings.
{23:4} These the appointments of Jehovah called holy, which ye shall call them in their appointment.
{23:5} In the first month, in the fourteenth of the month, between the two evenings, the passover to Jehovah.
{23:6} And in the fifteenth day of that month the festival of unleavened to Jehovah: seven days shall ye eat unleavened.
{23:7} In the first day a holy calling shall be to you: any work of labor ye shall not do.
{23:8} And offer ye a sacrifice to Jehovah seven days: in the seventh day a holy calling; any work of labor ye shall not do.
{23:9} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{23:10} Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When ye shall come into the land which I give to you, and ye reaped its harvest, and brought a handful of the first-fruits of your harvest to the priest:
{23:11} And he lifted up the handful before Jehovah for your acceptance: on the morrow of the Sabbath the priest shall lift it up.
{23:12} And in the day of your lifting up the handful, ye did a blameless lamb, the son of its year, for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.
{23:13} And its gift two tenths of fine flour mingled with oil; a sacrifice to Jehovah, an odor of sweetness: and its libation of wine, the fourth of the hin.
{23:14} And ye shall not eat bread, and parched, and early groats of grain, till the self-same day till that ye brought an offering to your God: a law forever to your generations, in all your dwellings.
{23:15} And ye counted to you from the morrow of the Sabbath from the day ye brought the handful of lifting up; seven Sabbaths shall be complete.
{23:16} Till from the morrow of the seventh Sabbath, shall ye number fifty days; and ye brought a new gift to Jehovah.
{23:17} From your dwellings shall ye bring two loaves lifted up, of two tenths of fine flour shall they be; leavened shall they be, baked, the first-fruits to Jehovah.
{23:18} And ye brought upon the bread seven blameless lambs, the sons of a year, and one bullock, the son of a cow, and two rams: they shall be a burnt-offering to Jehovah, and their gift and their libations, a sacrifice, an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
{23:19} And ye did one he goat of the goats for sin, and two lambs the sons of a year, for a sacrifice of peace.
{23:20} And the priest lifted them up upon the bread of the first-fruits, a lifting up before Jehovah upon the two lambs: they shall be holy to Jehovah for the priest.
{23:21} And ye called in this self-same day a holy calling of Jehovah to you: any work of labor ye shall not do: a law forever in all your dwellings for your generations.
{23:22} And in your reaping the harvest of your land, thou shalt not finish the extremity of thy field in thy reaping, and the gleaning of thy harvest thou shalt not glean: to the poor and to the stranger thou shalt leave them: I Jehovah your God.
{23:23} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{23:24} Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in one of the month, there shall be to you a Sabbath, a remembrance, shouts of joy, a holy calling.
{23:25} Any work of labor ye shall not do; and ye brought a sacrifice to Jehovah.
{23:26} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{23:27} But in this tenth of the seventh month, a day of expiation; shall be a holy calling to you, and ye humbled your souls, and brought a sacrifice to Jehovah.
{23:28} And any work ye shall not do in that self-same day, for it is a day of expiation, to expiate for you before Jehovah your God.
{23:29} For every soul which shall not be humbled in, that same day, and it was cut off from its people.
{23:30} And any soul which shall do any work in that same day, I destroyed that soul from the midst of its people.
{23:31} Any work ye shall not do: a law forever to your generations in all your dwellings.
{23:32} A Sabbath of rest it is to you; ye humbled your souls: in the ninth of the month, in the evening, from evening to evening shall ye celebrate your Sabbath.
{23:33} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{23:34} Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, In the fifteenth day of this seventh month the festival of tents seven days to Jehovah.
{23:35} In the first day a holy calling: any work of labor ye shall not do.
{23:36} Seven days shall ye bring a sacrifice to Jehovah; in the eighth day a holy calling shall be to you, and bring ye a sacrifice to Jehovah: it is a restraining: any work of labor ye shall not do.
{23:37} These the appointments to Jehovah, which ye shall call them callings holy, to bring a sacrifice to Jehovah, a burnt-offering and a gift, a sacrifice, and libations, the word of a day in its day:
{23:38} Besides the Sabbaths of Jehovah, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your voluntary gifts which ye shall give to Jehovah.
{23:39} But in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, in your gathering the produce of the land, ye shall keep a festival of Jehovah seven days: in the first day a Sabbath, and in the eighth day a Sabbath.
{23:40} And take ye to yourselves in the first day the fruit of the tree of ornament, palms of the palm trees, and branches of the tree interwoven, and willows of the stream; and ye rejoiced before Jehovah your God seven days.
{23:41} And keep it a festival to Jehovah seven days in the year: a law forever to your generations; in the seventh month shall ye keep it.
{23:42} Ye shall dwell in tents seven days; all the natives in Israel shall dwell in tents:
{23:43} So that your generations shall know that I caused the sons of Israel to dwell in tents in my bringing them out of the land of Egypt: I Jehovah your God.
{23:44} And Moses will speak the appointments of Jehovah to the sons of Israel.
{24:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{24:2} Command the sons of Israel, and they shall take to thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to ascend always.
{24:3} From without the vail of the testimony, in the tent of appointment, shall Aaron arrange it from evening to morning, before Jehovah always: a law forever to your generations.
{24:4} Upon the pure chandelier shall he arrange the lamps before Jehovah always.
{24:5} And take the fine flour and bake it, twelve cakes; two tenths shall be the one cake.
{24:6} And put them two rows, six the row, upon the pure table before Jehovah.
{24:7} And give upon the row pure frankincense, and it was to the bread for a remembrance; a sacrifice to Jehovah.
{24:8} In the day of the Sabbath, in the day of the Sabbath he shall arrange it before Jehovah always, from the sons of Israel, a covenant forever.
{24:9} And it was to Aaron and to his sons, and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is holy of holies to him from the sacrifices of Jehovah a law forever.
{24:10} And the son of a woman, an Israelitess, will go forth (he the son of a man an Egyptian) into the midst of the sons of Israel: and they will strive in the camp, the son of the Israelitess, and the man the Israelite.
{24:11} And the son of the woman the Israelitess, will curse the name, and will vilify, and they will bring him to Moses: and his mother's name Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, to the tribe of Dan.
{24:12} And they placed him in watch, to declare distinctly to them by the mouth of Jehovah.
{24:13} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{24:14} Bring him vilifying, without the camp; and all they hearing, placed their hands upon his head, and all the assembly stoned him.
{24:15} And to the sons of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, When a man, a man shall curse his God and he bore his sin.
{24:16} And he vilifying the name of Jehovah, dying, shall die; stoning, all the assembly shall stone him: as the stranger so the native, in his vilifying the name, he shall die.
{24:17} And when a man shall smite any soul of man, dying, he shall die.
{24:18} And he smiting the soul of cattle, shall recompense soul for soul.
{24:19} And when a man shall give a blemish in his neighbor, as he did so it shall be done to him:
{24:20} Fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he shall give a blemish in a man so it shall be given in him.
{24:21} And be smiting cattle shall recompense it; and he smiting man, shall die.
{24:22} One judgment to you; as the stranger so the native shall it be: for I Jehovah your God.
{24:23} And Moses will speak to the sons of Israel, and they will bring forth him cursing, without the camp, and they will stone him with stone: and the sons of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
{25:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, in mount Sinai, saying,
{25:2} Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When ye shall come into the land which I gave to you, the land shall rest a Sabbath to Jehovah.
{25:3} Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather its produce;
{25:4} And in the seventh year, a Sabbath of rest shall be to the land, a Sabbath to Jehovah: thy field thou shalt not sow, and thy vineyard thou shalt not prune.
{25:5} The overflowing of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy separation thou shalt not gather: a year of the Sabbaths shall be to the land.
{25:6} And the Sabbath of the land shall be to you for food; to thee and to thy servant, and to thy maid, and to thy hireling, and to thine inhabitant sojourning with thee.
{25:7} And to thy cattle, and to the beast which is in thy land shall all its produce be for food.
{25:8} And number to thee seven Sabbaths of years, seven years, seven times; and they shall be to thee the days of seven Sabbaths of years, nine and forty years.
{25:9} And cause the trumpet of shouts of joy to pass over: in the seventh month, in the tenth of the month, in the day of expiations, shall ye cause the trumpet to pass over in all your land.
{25:10} And consecrate the year, the fiftieth year, and call a letting go free in the land, to all inhabiting it: it shall be a jubilee to you; and return ye each to his possession, and each to his family shall ye turn back.
{25:11} It a jubilee the year, the fiftieth year shall be to you: ye shall not sow and ye shall not reap its overflowings, and ye shall not gather its separations.
{25:12} For it a jubilee; holy shall it be to you: from the field ye shall eat its produce.
{25:13} In the year of this jubilee ye shall turn back each to his possession.
{25:14} And when ye shall sell a selling to thy neighbor, or buying of thy neighbor's hand, ye shall not oppress each his brother.
{25:15} According to the number of years after the jubilee, thou shalt buy from thy neighbor; according to the number of the years produce shall he sell to thee.
{25:16} According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase his purchase, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish his purchase: for from the numbering of the produce, he sold to thee.
{25:17} And ye shall not oppress each his neighbor; and thou shalt fear thy God: for I Jehovah your God.
{25:18} And ye did my laws and watched my judgments and did them, and dwelt upon the land in confidence.
{25:19} And the land gave her fruits, and ye ate to satisfying, and ye dwelt in confidence upon it.
{25:20} And when ye shall say, What shall we eat in the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow and we shall not gather our produce.
{25:21} And I commanded my blessing to you in the sixth year, and it made the produce for three years.
{25:22} And ye sowed the eighth year, and ate from the old produce till the ninth year; till its produce came in ye shall eat the old.
{25:23} And the land shall not be sold to be cut off, for the land is to me; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.
{25:24} And in all the land of your possession ye shall give a redemption to the land.
{25:25} When thy brother shall be poor, and he sold his possession, and he being near to him came to redeem it, and he redeemed the selling of his brother.
{25:26} And when to a man there shall be none to him to redeem, and his hand attained and found a sufficiency to redeem it;
{25:27} And he reckoned the years of his selling, and he returned that remaining over to the man to whom he sold it, and turned back to his possession.
{25:28} And if his hand found not a sufficiency to return to him, and his selling was in the hand of him buying it, till the year of the jubilee: and it went forth in the jubilee, and he turned back to his possession.
{25:29} And when a man shall sell the house of dwelling in a walled city, its redemption of it shall be till it was completed: a year of days from its selling shall be its redemption.
{25:30} And if it was not redeemed till the filling up of a complete year, and the house which is in the city, which, if walled, was set forever to him buying it for his generation: it shall not go forth in the jubilee.
{25:31} And the houses of the villages which to them not being walled round about, shall be reckoned for a field of the land: redemption shall be to it, and it shall go forth in the jubilee.
{25:32} And the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, redemption shall be always to the Levites.
{25:33} And whoever shall redeem from the Levites, and the selling of the house and the city of his possession went out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites, this their possession in the midst of the sons of Israel.
{25:34} And the field of the area of their cities shall not be sold, for it is a possession to them forever.
{25:35} And when thy brother shall be poor, and his hand wavering with thee, hold fast to him; a stranger and sojourner to live with thee.
{25:36} Thou shalt not take from him interest and increase; thou shalt be afraid of thy God; and thy brother to live with thee.
{25:37} Thy silver thou shalt not give to him upon interest, and upon increase thou shalt not give him thy food.
{25:38} I am Jehovah your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give to you the land of Canaan, to be to you for God.
{25:39} And when thy brother shall be poor with thee, and he was sold to thee, thou shalt not serve upon him the service of a servant.
{25:40} As the hireling, as the sojourner, he shall be with thee; till the year of jubilee he shall serve with thee;
{25:41} And he shall go forth from thee, he and his sons with him, and turn back to his family, to the possession of his fathers shall he turn back.
{25:42} For they are my servants whom I brought them out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold from the sale of a servant.
{25:43} Thou shalt not rule over him with crushing, and thou shalt be afraid of thy God.
{25:44} And thy servant and thy maid which shall be to thee, from the nations which are round about you, from them ye shall buy servant and maid.
{25:45} And from the sons of the sojourner sojourning with you, from them shall ye buy, and from their families which are with you, which were born in your land: and they were to you for a possession.
{25:46} And ye shall possess them for your sons after you to take possession forever; ye shall serve with them: and over your brethren the sons of Israel, ye shall not rule over him, each over his brother with oppression.
{25:47} And if the hand of a stranger and sojourner with thee shall attain, and thy brother with him be poor, and he sold to the stranger, a sojourner with thee, or to the root of the stranger's family:
{25:48} After the selling, redemption shall be to him; one from his brethren shall redeem him:
{25:49} Or his uncle, or his uncle's son shall redeem him, or from the remainder of his flesh from his family, shall redeem him; or his hand attained, and he redeemed himself.
{25:50} And he reckoned with him buying him, from the year of his being sold to him till the year of the jubilee: and the silver of his selling was according to the number of years, as the days of a hireling, shall it be with him.
{25:51} If yet a multitude of years, according to them he shall return his redemption from the silver of his sale.
{25:52} And if a fewness remained to the years till the year of jubilee; and he reckoned to him according to his years, he shall return his redemption.
{25:53} As the hireling of the year by the year shall he be with him: he shall not rule him by crushing to thine eyes.
{25:54} And if he shall not be redeemed in these, and he shall go forth in the year of the jubilee, he and his sons with him.
{25:55} For to me the sons of Israel are servants; they are my servants which I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: I Jehovah your God.
{26:1} Ye shall not make to yourselves vain things, and carving, and a pillar ye shall not set up to you, and a stone of imagery ye shall not give in your land, to worship upon it: for I Jehovah your God.
{26:2} Ye shall watch my Sabbaths, and ye shall fear my holy place: I Jehovah.
{26:3} If ye shall go in my laws and watch my commands, and do them:
{26:4} And I gave your rains in their times, and the land gave its produce, and the tree of the field shall give its fruit:
{26:5} And the threshing time to you reached the vintage, and the vintage shall reach the sowing: and ye ate your bread to satisfying, and ye dwelt in confidence upon your land.
{26:6} And I gave peace in the land and ye lay down and not being terrified: and I caused the evil beast to cease out of the land, and the sword shall not pass through in your land.
{26:7} And ye chased your enemies, and they fell before you to the sword.
{26:8} And five from you chased a hundred, and a hundred from you chased ten thousand: and your enemies fell before you to the sword.
{26:9} And I turned to you and I made you fruitful, and I multiplied you, and I set up my covenant with you.
{26:10} And ye ate of the old, being dry, and ye shall bring forth the old from before the new.
{26:11} And I gave my dwelling in the midst of you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
{26:12} And I walked in the midst of you, and I was to you for God, and ye shall be to me for a people.
{26:13} I Jehovah your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, from being servants to them, and I will break the rod of your yoke, and I will cause you to go erect.
{26:14} And if ye will not hear to me, and will not do all these commands;
{26:15} And if ye shall reject my laws, and if your soul shall abhor my judgments so as not to do all my commands, to your breaking my covenant:
{26:16} Surely I will do this to you, and I appointed over you terror, consumption, and burning fever, destroying the eyes and consuming the soul: and ye sowed in vain your seed, and your enemies shall eat it.
{26:17} And I gave my face against you, and ye were slain before your enemies: and they hating you ruled over you, and ye fled and none pursued you.
{26:18} And if yet these ye will not hear to me, I added to chastise you seven times for your sins.
{26:19} And I broke the pride of your strength: and I gave your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:
{26:20} And your strength shall be exhausted to no purpose: and your land shall not give its produce, and the tree of the land shall not give its fruit.
{26:21} And if ye shall go hostile with me, and shall not be willing to hear to me, and I added upon you seven blows for your sins.
{26:22} And I sent upon you the beast of the field, and it bereaved you of children, and cut off your cattle, and, diminished you, and your ways were laid waste.
{26:23} And if by these ye will not be admonished by me, and ye went hostile with me;
{26:24} And I went also hostile with you, and I struck you, also I, seven for your sins.
{26:25} And I brought upon you the sword to avenge vengeance of the covenant: and ye were gathered into your cities and I sent death in the midst of you, and ye were given into the hand of the enemy.
{26:26} In my breaking to you the rod of bread, and ten women baked your bread in one oven, and they returned your bread by weight: and ye ate, and ye shall not be satisfied.
{26:27} And if by this ye shall not hear to me, and ye went hostile with me;
{26:28} And I went hostile with you in anger; and I chastised you, I also, seven for your sins.
{26:29} And ye ate the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
{26:30} And I laid waste your high places, and I cut off your images, and I gave your carcasses upon the carcasses of your blocks, and my soul abhorred you.
{26:31} And I gave your cities a desert, and I laid waste your holy places, and I will not smell upon the odor of your sweetness.
{26:32} And I laid the land waste, and your enemies were astonished at it, they dwelling upon it.
{26:33} And I will scatter you among the nations, and I drew out after you a sword: and your land was a desert, and your cities shall be a desolation.
{26:34} Then shall the land delight with its Sabbaths, all the days of its desolation, and ye in the land of your enemies: then shall the land rest and delight with its Sabbaths.
{26:35} All the days of its desolation shall it rest, which it did not rest in your Sabbaths, in your dwelling upon it.
{26:36} And they remaining of you, and I brought timidity into their heart in the land of their enemies; and the voice of a driven leaf pursued them, and they fled, fleeing the sword; and they fell, and none pursued.
{26:37} And they faltered each upon his brother, as from before the sword, and none pursued: and there shall be to you no power of standing before your enemies.
{26:38} And ye were destroyed in the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
{26:39} And they being left of you, shall pine away in their sin in the land of your enemies, and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
{26:40} And they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, and the transgression which they dealt treacherously against me, and also that they went hostile with me;
{26:41} I also will go hostile with them, and I brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised heart shall be humbled, and then they shall be satisfied with their iniquity;
{26:42} And I remembered my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaak, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
{26:43} And the land shall be left of them, and shall delight with its Sabbaths in its desolation from them: and they shall be satisfied because of their iniquity, and because they rejected my judgments, and my laws their soul abhorred.
{26:44} And yet also this in their being in the land of their enemies, I did not reject them, and I did not abhor them, to cut them off, and to break my covenant with them: for I Jehovah their God.
{26:45} And I remembered for them the covenant of their beginnings, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt, in the eyes of the nations to be to them for God: I Jehovah.
{26:46} These the laws, and judgments, and precepts, which Jehovah gave between him, and between the sons of Israel, in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.
{27:1} And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
{27:2} Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall separate a vow by thy estimation, the souls for Jehovah.
{27:3} And thy estimation was the male of the son of twenty years, and even to the son of sixty years; and thy estimation was fifty shekels of silver by the shekel of the holy place.
{27:4} And if it is a female, thy estimation was thirty shekels.
{27:5} And if from the son of five years, and even to the son of twenty years, and thy estimation was, the male, twenty shekels, and for the female, ten shekels.
{27:6} And if from the son of a month, and even to the son of five years, and thy estimation was, the male, five shekels of silver, and for the female, thy estimation, three shekels of silver.
{27:7} And if from the son of sixty years and from above, if a male, thy estimation was fifteen shekels, and for a female, ten shekels.
{27:8} And if he was poor above thy estimation, and he stood before the priest, and the priest estimated him: and according to whose mouth the hand shall attain, the priest estimated him vowing.
{27:9} And if cattle which they shall make an offering from them to Jehovah, all which he shall give from it to Jehovah shall be holy.
{27:10} He shall not change it, and he shall not exchange it, good for evil, or evil for good: and if changing, he shall change cattle for cattle, and the beast, it and its exchange shall be holy.
{27:11} And if any unclean cattle which they shall not bring near from it an offering to Jehovah, and he made the quadruped to stand before the priest.
{27:12} And the priest estimated it between good and between evil: according to thy valuation, O priest, so shall it be.
{27:13} And if redeeming, he shall redeem it, and he shall add its fifth upon thy estimation.
{27:14} And when a man shall consecrate his house holy to Jehovah, and the priest estimated it between good and between evil: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
{27:15} And if he consecrating shall redeem his house, and he shall add the fifth of the silver of thy estimation upon it, and it was to him.
{27:16} And if from the field of his possession a man shall consecrate to Jehovah, and thy estimation was according to its seed: the seed of an omer of barley, at fifty shekels of silver.
{27:17} If from the year of jubilee he shall consecrate his field, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
{27:18} And if after the jubilee he shall consecrate his field, and the priest reckoned to him the silver upon the month of the years remaining, till the year of the jubilee, and it was taken away from thy estimation.
{27:19} And if he consecrating it, redeeming, shall redeem the field, and he shall add the fifth of the silver of thy estimation upon it, and it stood to him.
{27:20} And if he shall not redeem the field, and if he sold the field to another man, it shall be redeemed no more.
{27:21} And the field in its going forth in the jubilee was holy to Jehovah, as a consecrated field: to the priest shall be its possession.
{27:22} And if the field of his purchase which is not from the field of his possession he shall consecrate to Jehovah;
{27:23} And the priest reckoned to him the number of thy estimation till the year of jubilee: and he gave thy estimation in that day, holy to Jehovah.
{27:24} In the year of the jubilee the field shall return to whom they bought it from him, to him to whom the possession of the land.
{27:25} And all thy estimation shall be according to the holy shekel: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
{27:26} But the first-born which shall be first to Jehovah among the cattle, a man shall not consecrate it; if an ox, if a sheep, it is to Jehovah.
{27:27} And if from unclean cattle, and he redeemed by thy estimation, and he shall add the fifth upon it: and if it shall not be redeemed, and it was sold by thy estimation.
{27:28} But all consecrated which a man shall consecrate to Jehovah from all which is to him, from man and cattle, and from the field of his possession, shall not be sold and shall not be redeemed: every thing consecrated it is holy of holies to Jehovah.
{27:29} Every thing consecrated which shall be consecrated from man, shall not be redeemed: dying, it shall die.
{27:30} And all the tenth of the land from the seed of the land, from the fruit of the tree, is to Jehovah: it is holy to Jehovah.
{27:31} And if redeeming, a man shall redeem from his tenth, he shall add to its fifth upon it.
{27:32} And all the tenth of cattle and sheep, all which shall pass through under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Jehovah.
{27:33} He shall not search between good to evil, and he shall not exchange it; and if exchanging, he shall exchange it, and it was, it and its exchange shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
{27:34} These the commands which Jehovah commanded Moses to the sons of Israel in mount Sinai.
