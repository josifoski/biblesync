{1:1} Paul, sent of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and brother Timothy, to the church of God being in Corinth, with all holy ones being in the whole of Achaia:
{1:2} Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
{1:3} Praised the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion, and God of all comfort:
{1:4} Who comforting us upon all our pressure, that we may be able to comfort them in every pressure, by the comfort by which we ourselves are comforted by God.
{1:5} For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so by Christ abounds also our comfort.
{1:6} And whether we are pressed, for your comfort and salvation, being well wrought in endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer: whether we are comforted, for your comfort and salvation.
{1:7} And our hope firm for you, knowing, that as ye are participators of the sufferings, so also of the comfort.
{1:8} For we wish you not to be ignorant, brethren, of our pressure having been to us in Asia, that we were exceedingly loaded, above strength, so that we were in utter perplexity even to live:
{1:9} And we ourselves have had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have trusted in ourselves, but in God raising the dead:
{1:10} Who saved us from so great a death, and does save: in whom we have hoped also that he will yet save;
{1:11} And ye serving together for us in prayer, that of many faces, the favor to us by many thanks be returned by us.
{1:12} For our boasting is this, the testimony of our consciousness, that in simplicity and purity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we turned back in the world, and more eminently to you.
{1:13} For we write no others to you, but what ye either know or also observe; and I hope that also even to the end ye will observe;
{1:14} As also ye observed us by part, that we are your boast, as also ye ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
{1:15} And in this confidence I wished to come to you before, that ye might have a second grace;
{1:16} And by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia, to come to you, and by you to be sent forward to Judea.
{1:17} Therefore I resolved this, much less did I use levity: or what I resolve, do I resolve according to the flesh, that there be with me yea, yea, and nay, nay.
{1:18} And God faithful, for our word to you was not yea or nay.
{1:19} For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who proclaimed in you by us, by me, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but was yea in him.
{1:20} Forasmuch as the solemn promises of God in him yea, and in him Amen, for glory to God by us.
{1:21} And he making us firm with you in Christ, and having anointed us, is God;
{1:22} Who also having sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.
{1:23} And I call upon God a witness upon my soul, that, sparing you, I came no more to Corinth.
{1:24} Not that we are masters of your faith, but we are aiders of your joy: for ye have stood in the faith.
{2:1} And I determined this to myself, not to come to you again in sadness.
{2:2} For if I grieve you, and who is he making me glad, except he being grieved by me.
{2:3} And I wrote this same to you lest, coming, I should have sadness from whom I ought to rejoice, trusting to you all, that mine is the joy of you all.
{2:4} For out of much pressure and anxiety of heart I wrote to you through many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love I have more abundantly towards you.
{2:5} And if any have grieved, he has not grieved me, but by part; that I might not overload you all.
{2:6} Sufficient to such a one this enjoyment of the esteem of the many.
{2:7} So that on the contrary ye should rather show kindness, and console, lest perhaps such be swallowed down with more abundant sadness.
{2:8} Wherefore I beseech you to confirm love to him.
{2:9} For, for this I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, if ye are obedient for all things.
{2:10} And to whom ye show any favor; I also: for also if I have shown any kindness, to whom I have shown kindness, through you in the face of Christ;
{2:11} That we might not be taken advantage of by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his inventions.
{2:12} And coming to Troas for the good news of Christ, and a door having been opened to me in the Lord,
{2:13} I have had no relaxation to my spirit, in my not finding Titus my brother: but having taken leave of them, I went out to Macedonia.
{2:14} Grace to God, always leading us to triumph in Christ, and making manifest the order of his knowledge by us in every place.
{2:15} For we are to God a sweet odor of Christ, in the saved, and in the host:
{2:16} Truly to those an odor of death into death; and to those an odor of life into life. And who sufficient for these things?
{2:17} For we are not as the many adulterating the word of God: but as of purity, but as of God, before the face of God speak we in Christ.
{3:1} Begin we again to recommend ourselves or need we not, as some; recommendatory epistles to you, or recommendatory from you?
{3:2} Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and acknowledged by all men:
{3:3} Made manifest that ye are the epistle of Christ served by us, not written with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables made of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart.
{3:4} And we have such confidence through Christ to God:
{3:5} Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to reckon anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency of God;
{3:6} Who rendered as fitting servants of the new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter kills, and the Spirit makes alive.
{3:7} And if the service of death, in letters imprinted in stones, was in glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look intently to the face of Moses for the glory of his face; being left unemployed.
{3:8} How shall not rather the service of the Spirit be in glory?
{3:9} For if the service of condemnation glory, much more the service of justice abounds in glory.
{3:10} For also that having been glorified has not been glorified in this part, for sake of the glory excelling.
{3:11} For if that left unemployed by glory, much more that remaining in glory.
{3:12} Therefore having such hope, we use much freedom of speech:
{3:13} And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the sons of Israel should not look intently to the end of that left unemployed:
{3:14} But their minds were hardened: for until this day the same veil upon the reading of the old covenant remains not uncovered; for in Christ it is left unemployed.
{3:15} But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies upon their heart.
{3:16} And whenever it turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
{3:17} And the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord, there freedom.
{3:18} And we all, shown as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, with the face uncovered, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as from the Spirit of the Lord.
{4:1} For this, having this service, as we were compassionated, we lose not courage;
{4:2} But have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craft, neither adulterating the word of God; but by manifestation of the truth recommending ourselves to every consciousness of man before God.
{4:3} And if also our good news is hid, in the lost is it hid:
{4:4} In whom the God of this world blinded the minds of the unbelieving, so that the enlightening of the good news of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, does not enlighten them.
{4:5} For we proclaim not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus.
{4:6} For God, having spoken light to shine out of darkness, who shone in our hearts, to the enlightening of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
{4:7} And we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the eminence of power be of God, and not of us.
{4:8} Being pressed in every thing, but not straightened; being at a loss, but not utterly perplexed;
{4:9} Being driven out, but not forsaken; being cast down, but not destroyed;
{4:10} Always bearing about in the body the death of the Lord Jesus, that also the life of Jesus be made manifest in our body.
{4:11} For we, the living, are always delivered to death for Jesus, that also the life of Jesus be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
{4:12} So that death is truly energetic in us, and life in you.
{4:13} And having the same spirit of faith, according to that written, I believed, therefore I spake: and we believe, and therefore we speak;
{4:14} Knowing that he having raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us by Jesus, and present us with you.
{4:15} For all things for you, that grace, having abounded by the many, might abound in thanksgiving to the glory of God.
{4:16} Wherefore we lose not courage; but if also our man without is destroyed, but he within is renewed day and day.
{4:17} For the present moment the lightness of our pressure works to us an eternal weight of glory, as eminence upon eminence;
{4:18} We looking not at things seen, but at things not seen: for things seen, temporary; and things not seen, eternal.
{5:1} For we know that if our earthly house of the tent were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
{5:2} For also in this we groan, longing to have our dwelling from heaven put on:
{5:3} If also being even clothed we shall not be found naked.
{5:4} For also being in the tent we groan, being loaded: since we wish not to be unclothed, but to be clothed, that the mortal should be swallowed up of life.
{5:5} And he having brought us about to this same, God, he having also given us the pledge of the Spirit.
{5:6} Therefore being always confident, and knowing that, being at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
{5:7} (For we walk by faith, and not by external appearance:)
{5:8} And we are confident, and are contented rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home in the Lord.
{5:9} Wherefore also let us seek the honour, whether being at home, whether being absent, to be pleasing to him.
{5:10} For we must all be made manifest before the judgment seat of Christ; that each might receive the things for the body, for what he did, good or bad.
{5:11} Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; and we are made manifest to God; and I hope also to have been made manifest to your consciences.
{5:12} For not again do we recommend ourselves to you, but giving you occasion for boasting over us, that ye might have for them boasting in face, and not in heart.
{5:13} For whether we be beside ourselves, to God: or be of sound mind, to you.
{5:14} For the love of Christ holds us together; having judged this, that if one died for all, then all dead:
{5:15} And he died for all, that the living no more live to themselves, but o him having died for them, and having risen.
{5:16} So that we from now know none according to the flesh: and if also we have known Christ according to the flesh, but now we know no more.
{5:17} So that if any in Christ, a new creation: old things have passed away; behold, all have become new.
{5:18} And all things of God, having reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and given us the service of reconciliation;
{5:19} For as God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their faults; and having set in us the word of reconciliation.
{5:20} For Christ therefore are we ambassadors, as of God beseeching by us: we pray for the sake of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.
{5:21} For him not knowing sin, he made sin for us; that we might be the justice of God in him.
{6:1} And working together, we also beseech, lest also ye receive the grace of God in vain.
{6:2} (For he says, In an acceptable time I listened to thee, and in the day of salvation have I run to succor thee: behold, now the acceptable time; behold; now the day of salvation.)
{6:3} Giving no offence in any thing, that the service be not blamed:
{6:4} But in every thing recommending ourselves as servants of God, in much patience, in pressures, in necessities, in extremities,
{6:5} In blows, in imprisonments, in disorders, in fatigues, in watchings, in fastings;
{6:6} In purity, in knowledge, in long suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned.
{6:7} In the word of truth, in the power of God, through the weapons of justice of the right hands and the left,
{6:8} Through glory and ignominy, through slander and applause: as erring, and true;
{6:9} As being ignorant, and knowing; as dying, and, behold, we live; as being disciplined, and not killed;
{6:10} As being grieved, and always rejoicing; as poor, and making many rich; as having nothing, and possessing all things.
{6:11} Our month stands open to you, O Corinthians, our heart has been enlarged.
{6:12} Ye are not contracted in us, but ye are contracted in your bowels.
{6:13} And for the same recompense, (I speak as to children,) be ye yourselves also enlarged.
{6:14} Be not unequally yoked together with the unbelieving: for what participation to justice and iniquity and what communion to light with darkness?
{6:15} And what conformity to Christ with Belial? and what part to the believing with the unbelieving?
{6:16} And what agreement to the temple of God with images? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God said, That I will dwell in them, and will go round about; and will be their God, and they shall be a people to me.
{6:17} Therefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean; and I will receive you.
{6:18} And I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.
{7:1} Therefore having these declarations, dearly let us cleanse ourselves from all defilements of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
{7:2} Receive us; we injured none, we corrupted none, we took advantage of none.
{7:3} I speak not to condemnation: for I have said before, ye are in our hearts to die together, and live together.
{7:4} Much freedom of speech to me toward you; to me much boasting over you: I am filled with consolation, I superabound in joy in all your pressure.
{7:5} For also, we having come to Macedonia, our flesh had no relaxation, but pressed in everything; without conflicts, within fears.
{7:6} But God, comforting the humble, comforted us in the arrival of Titus;
{7:7} And not only in his arrival, but also in the comfort which he was comforted in you, announcing to us your anxious desire, your lamentations, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more.
{7:8} For if I also grieved you in the epistle, I regret not, and if I did regret: for I see that that epistle, if also for a time, grieved you.
{7:9} Now I rejoice, not that ye were grieved, but that ye were grieved to repentance: for ye were grieved according to God, that ye be injured in nothing by us.
{7:10} For grief according to God works repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but grief of the world works death.
{7:11} For behold, this same that ye grieve according to God, what care it wrought in you, but defence, but indignation, but fear, but anxious desire, but zeal, but punishing! In every thing ye recommended yourselves to be holy in this affair.
{7:12} Wherefore, if I also wrote to you, not for him having been unjust, for him having suffered injustice, but that your care for us might be made manifest to you before God.
{7:13} Therefore have we been comforted in your comfort: and we rejoiced more abundantly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed from you all.
{7:14} For if I have boasted anything to him of you, I was not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, so also was our boasting over Titus the truth.
{7:15} And his bowels are more abundantly to you, remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and tremor ye received him.
{7:16} I rejoice that I place confidence in you in everything.
{8:1} And we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God given in the churches of Macedonia;
{8:2} That in much proof of pressure the abundance of their joy and their poverty according to depth abounded to the abundance of their simplicity.
{8:3} For according to power, I testify, and above power chosen voluntarily;
{8:4} Praying us with much entreaty that we receive the grace and participation of the service for saints.
{8:5} And not as we hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.
{8:6} So that we besought Titus, that as he began before, so also he would complete to us this grace also.
{8:7} But as ye abound in everything, in faith, and in word, and in knowledge, and in all care, and in love from you to us, that also ye abound in this grace.
{8:8} I speak not according to command, but by care of others, trying also the purity of your love.
{8:9} For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for you he was in a state of beggary, being rich; that ye in his poverty might be rich.
{8:10} And in this I give an opinion: for this is profitable to you, which no only to do, but to will, ye began before from last year.
{8:11} And now also complete ye the doing; that as a forwardness to will so also to complete, out of what is possessed.
{8:12} For if a forwardness lie before, according as any has, it is acceptable, not as he has not.
{8:13} For not that ease to others, and pressure to you:
{8:14} But of equality, now in this time your abundance for their want, that also their abundance be for your want: that there be equality:
{8:15} As has been written, He to whom much, was not in excess; and he to whom little, was not diminished.
{8:16} And grace to God, having given the same care for you in the heart of Titus.
{8:17} For truly he received the entreaty; and being more earnest, he went forth voluntarily to you.
{8:18} And we sent with him the brother whose approbation in the good news through all the churches;
{8:19} And not only, but also the hand stretched out by the churches for our fellow-traveler with this grace, served by us to the glory of the same Lord, and to your forwardness:
{8:20} Prepared for this, lest any blame us in this abundance served by us:
{8:21} Providing good things beforehand, not only before the Lord, but also before men.
{8:22} And we sent with them our brother, whom we proved in many things being earnest many times, and now much more earnest, with much confidence in you.
{8:23} Whether for Titus, my companion and co-worker to you: or our brethren, the sent of the churches, the glory of Christ.
{8:24} Therefore the manifestations of your love, and of your boasting for us, shew ye to them, and to the face of the churches.
{9:1} For truly, concerning the service to the holy ones, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
{9:2} For I know your forwardness, which I boast of for you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was prepared from last year; and zeal from you excited the many more.
{9:3} And I sent the brethren, lest our boasting for you be empty in this part; that, as I said, ye might be prepared:
{9:4} Lest if in some way the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we should be ashamed, (that we should not say, ye) in this principle of boasting.
{9:5} Therefore I thought necessary to beseech the brethren that they go before to you, and prepare beforehand your praise, having been proclaimed beforehand, this same to be prepared, so as praise, and not as covetousness.
{9:6} And this, He sowing sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he sowing in praises shall reap also in praises.
{9:7} Each as he chooses in the heart; not of grief, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.
{9:8} And God able for all grace to abound in you; having always all sufficiency in everything, ye abound in every good work:
{9:9} (As has been written, He scattered; he gave to the poor: his justice remains forever.
{9:10} And now he furnishing seed to him sowing, and bread for food, furnish and multiply your sowing-season, and increase the fruits of your justice;)
{9:11} Enriched in everything in all simplicity, which works through us gratitude to God.
{9:12} For the service of this office is not only filling up the wants of the saints, but also abounding through many thanks to God;
{9:13} By the proof of this service honouring God for the subjection of your assent to the good news of Christ, and to the simplicity of mutual participation to them and to all;
{9:14} And by their prayer for you, longing for you through the exceeding grace of God upon you.
{9:15} And grace to God for his indescribable gift.
{10:1} And I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and equity of Christ, who, in face truly low with you, but at a distance bold towards you:
{10:2} And I pray, being present, not to be bold with the confidence which I reckon to encounter against certain, reckoning us as walking about according to the flesh.
{10:3} For walking in the flesh, we war not after the flesh:
{10:4} (For the weapons of our warfare not fleshly, but powerful to God to the taking down of fortified places;)
{10:5} Taking down reckonings, and every elevation lifted up against the knowledge of God, and taking captive every thought to the obedience of Christ;
{10:6} And having in readiness to avenge every imperfect instruction, when your obedience should be completed.
{10:7} See ye things according to the face? If any has persuaded himself to be of Christ, let him reckon this again of himself, that, as he of Christ, so we also of Christ.
{10:8} For if I also boast something more abundantly of our power, which the Lord gave us for the building up, and not for your taking down, I shall not be ashamed:
{10:9} Lest I seem as terrifying you by epistles.
{10:10} (For truly the epistles, he says, weighty and strong; but the presence of the body weak, and the word counted as nothing.)
{10:11} Let such a one reckon this, that, such as we are in the word by the epistles, being away, such also, being present, in deed.
{10:12} For we dare not appear or join ourselves to certain of them recommending themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and joining themselves to themselves, do not understand.
{10:13} And we boast not of things immeasurable, but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure divided to us, to reach even also to you.
{10:14} For not as reaching to you we stretch beyond ourselves: for also even to you we came before in the good news of Christ:
{10:15} Not boasting in things immeasurable, in the toils of others; and having hope, your faith being increased, to be enlarged in you according to our rule for abundance,
{10:16} To announce the good hews in things beyond you, not in another's rule to boast for things prepared.
{10:17} But he boasting, let him boast in the Lord.
{10:18} For not he recommending himself, this is acceptable, but whom the Lord recommends.
{11:1} I would ye hold me up a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.
{11:2} For I am zealous of you with the zeal of God: for I fitted you to one husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.
{11:3} And I am afraid lest, as the serpent completely deceived Eve in his craft, so your thoughts be corrupted from the simplicity which in Christ.
{11:4} For if he coming proclaim another Jesus, which I proclaimed not, or ye receive another spirit, which ye received not, or other good news, which ye received not, ye have held up well.
{11:5} For I reckon myself to be nothing greatly inferior to the sent.
{11:6} And, if also ignorant in the word, but not in knowledge; but in every thing, we having been made manifest in all for you.
{11:7} Or did I a sin, humbling myself that ye might be exalted, because I announced to you the good news of God gratuitously?
{11:8} I stripped other churches, having received pay, for your service.
{11:9} And being present with you, and having wanted, I acted not with negligence to any: (for the brethren having come from Macedonia filled up still more my want:) and I kept myself in every thing not burdensome to you, and I will keep.
{11:10} The truth of Christ is in me, for this boasting shall not be shut up in me in the regions of Achaia.
{11:11} Wherefore? because I love you not? God knows.
{11:12} And what I do, and I will do, that I shall not cut off the occasion of those wishing the occasion; that in what they boast, they be found as also we.
{11:13} For such the falsely sent, crafty workers, being transformed into the sent of Christ.
{11:14} And not wonderful; for Satan himself is transformed into a messenger of light.
{11:15} No great thing therefore if also his servants are transformed as servants of justice; whose end shall be according to their works.
{11:16} Again I say, lest any one should think me to be mad; and if not so indeed, as mad do ye receive me that I might also boast myself some little.
{11:17} What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as in madness, in this first principle of boasting.
{11:18} Since many boast according to the flesh, I shall also boast.
{11:19} For ye bear with the mad willingly, being wise.
{11:20} For ye bear, if any reduce you to bondage, if any devour, if any receive, if any be lifted up, if any skin you on the face.
{11:21} I speak according to dishonour, as that we were weak. And in what any dares, (I speak in rashness,) I dare also.
{11:22} Are they Hebrews? I also. Are they Israelites? I also. Are they Abraham's seed? I also.
{11:23} Are they Christ's servants? (I speak being light-headed) I above; in toils more abundant, in blows more excessively, in watchings more abundantly, in deaths often.
{11:24} Of the Jews five times I received forty, except one.
{11:25} Thrice was I scourged with rods, once was I stoned, thrice suffered I shipwreck, I have made a night and day in the deep;
{11:26} In journeys often, in dangers of rivers, in dangers of robbers, in dangers of the family, in dangers from the nations, in dangers in the city, in dangers in solitude, in dangers in the sea, in dangers with false brethren;
{11:27} In fatigue and toil, in watchfulnesses often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
{11:28} Besides things outside, my distraction daily, the care of all the churches.
{11:29} Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I am not inflamed.
{11:30} If I must boast, I will boast things of my weakness.
{11:31} God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ knows, he being praised forever, that I lie not.
{11:32} In Damascus king Aretas' governor watched the city of the Damascenes, wishing to seize me.
{11:33} And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and I escaped from his hands.
{12:1} Indeed it is not profitable to me to boast. For I will come to visions and Revelation of the Lord.
{12:2} I knew a man in Christ before fourteen years, (whether in the body, I know not; whether out of the body, I know not: God knows;) such a one having been carried off even to the third heaven.
{12:3} And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, whether out of the body, I know not: God knows;)
{12:4} That he was carried off into paradise, and heard words not to be told, which it was not permitted man to speak.
{12:5} Of such a one will I boast: and of myself I will not boast, except in my weakness.
{12:6} For if I be willing to boast, I shall not be mad; for the truth will I say: and I spare, lest any reckon for me above what he sees me, or what he hears of me.
{12:7} And lest I be lifted up by the eminence of Revelation, a thorn in the flesh was given me, a messenger of Satan, that he might cuff me, lest I be lifted up.
{12:8} For this thrice besought I the Lord, that it remove away from me.
{12:9} And he said to me, My grace suffices thee: for my power is perfected in weakness. Therefore very willingly will I boast rather in my weaknesses, that Christ's power may lodge upon me.
{12:10} Therefore am I contented in weaknesses, in reproaches, in necessities in expulsions, in extremities for Christ: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
{12:11} I have been mad boasting; ye forced me: for I ought to have been recommended by you: for I was not greatly inferior to the sent, if also I am nothing.
{12:12} Surely the signs of one sent was wrought in you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and powers.
{12:13} For what is it which ye were inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself acted not with negligence to you? favor me for this injustice.
{12:14} Behold, I have prepared to come to you the third time; and I will not act with negligence to you: for I seek not your things, but you: for children ought not to treasure up for parents, but parents for children.
{12:15} And I very willingly will expend and be expended for your souls; if also loving you more abundantly, the less I should be loved.
{12:16} And "let it be, I overloaded you not: but being dexterous, I took you by contrivance.
{12:17} Not any of whom I have sent to you have I by him taken advantage of you.
{12:18} I called for Titus, and sent with a brother. Has Titus taken advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? not in the same steps?
{12:19} Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves to you? before God in Christ we speak: and all things, beloved, for your building up.
{12:20} For I am afraid, lest somehow, having come, I find you not such; as I will, and I find you such as ye wish not: lest somehow, strifes, jealousies, wraths, intrigues, calumnies, whisperings, inflations, derangements:
{12:21} Lest, coming again, my God should humble me with you, and I shall mourn for many of them having sinned before, and not having repented for uncleanness, and fornication, and licentiousness which they committed.
{13:1} This third I come to you. By mouth of two witnesses, and three, shall every word be established.
{13:2} I have said before, and say beforehand, as being present the second; and being away now I write to them having sinned before, and to all the rest, that, if I should come again, I will not spare:
{13:3} Since seek proof of Christ speaking in me, who to you is no weak, but has power in you.
{13:4} For also if he was crucified from weakness, but he lives from the power of God. For also we are weak in him, but we live with him from the power of God to you.
{13:5} Try yourselves, if ye are in the faith; prove yourselves. Or know ye not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless ye are not tried?
{13:6} And I hope that ye shall know that we are not untried.
{13:7} And I pray to God that ye do nothing evil; not that we appear tried, but that ye do good, and we be as untried.
{13:8} For we are not able anything against the truth, but for the truth.
{13:9} For we rejoice when we be weak, and ye be able: and this also we pray, your restoration.
{13:10} For this I write these things being absent, that being present I should not wound severely, according to the power which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for pulling down.
{13:11} As to the rest, brethren, rejoice. Be adjusted, be comforted, think the same, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall with you.
{13:12} Greet ye one another in a holy kiss.
{13:13} All the holy ones greet you.
{13:14} The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit with you all. Amen.
