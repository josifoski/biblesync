{1:1} Peter, sent of Jesus Christ, to the chosen strangers of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
{1:2} According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the consecration of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.
{1:3} Praised the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy having begotten us again to a living hope, by the rising up of Jesus Christ from the dead,
{1:4} To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and unfading, kept in the heavens for us,
{1:5} Who by the power of God watching ourselves by faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
{1:6} By which ye are transported with joy, now for a little, (if it is necessary,) having grieved in various temptations:
{1:7} That the proof of your faith, much more precious than perishing gold, and being tried by fire, might be found to praise and honour and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ:
{1:8} Whom not having seen, ye love; in whom, now not seeing, but believing, ye are transported with joy unalterable, and highly valued:
{1:9} Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of souls.
{1:10} For which salvation the prophets sought and inquired anxiously, they having prophesied of the grace to you:
{1:11} Searching for whom or what time the Spirit of Christ which in them manifested, testifying beforehand the sufferings to Christ, and the glories after these.
{1:12} To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they were serving these things, which now have been again proclaimed to you by them having announced the good news in the Holy Spirit sent from heaven; into which angels eagerly desire to stoop and creep.
{1:13} Wherefore having girded up the loins of your mind, living abstemiously, hope perfectly upon the grace brought to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ;
{1:14} As children of obedience, not as formerly conforming yourselves to eager desire in your ignorance:
{1:15} But according to the holy one calling you, also should ye yourselves be holy in all turning back;
{1:16} For it has been written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.
{1:17} And if ye call upon the Father, judging without distinction of persons according to the work of each, in fear be occupied in the time of your sojourning:
{1:18} Knowing that not with corruptible things, silver and gold, were ye redeemed from your vain mode of life transmitted from your fathers.
{1:19} But with precious blood, as of a lamb blameless and spotless, of Christ:
{1:20} Known truly before the foundation of the world, and made manifest in the last times for you,
{1:21} Who by him believing in God, having raised him from the dead, and having given him glory; that your faith and hope should be in God.
{1:22} Having purified your souls in the hearing of the truth by the Spirit to unfeigned brotherly love, out of pure hearts love ye one another cordially:
{1:23} Begotten again, not of corrupted seed, but uncorrupted, by the word of God, living and remaining forever.
{1:24} For all flesh as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass dried up, and the flower fell out:
{1:25} And the word of the Lord remains forever. And this is the word having announced good news to you.
{2:1} Therefore setting aside all wickedness, and all artifice, and dissimulation; and envies, and all calumnies,
{2:2} As new born babes, long for the sincere milk pertaining to the word, that ye might be nourished with it:
{2:3} If ye have tasted that the Lord is good.
{2:4} To whom approaching, a living stone, truly disapproved of by men, and chosen by God, highly valued,
{2:5} And ye yourselves are built, as living stones, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to bring up spiritual sacrifice; acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
{2:6} Wherefore also it holds in the writing, Behold, I place in Zion a corner stone, chosen, highly valued: and he believing on him shall not be ashamed.
{2:7} Therefore honour to you believing: and to the unbelieving, the stone which the builders disapproved of has become the head of the corner,
{2:8} And a stone of stumble, and rock of offence, they disbelieving the word stumble: to which also they were set.
{2:9} And ye a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for acquisition; so that ye should proclaim the excellencies of him having called you out of darkness into his wonderful light:
{2:10} Who once not a people, and now the people of God: they not commiserated, and now commiserated.
{2:11} Dearly beloved, I beseech as sojourners and strangers, to keep off from fleshly passions, which war against the soul;
{2:12} Having your turning back good in the nations: that, in what they speak against you as doing evil, from good works, they having beheld, might praise God in the day of inspection.
{2:13} Be subjected to every creation proceeding from man on account of the Lord: whether to the king, as having superiority;
{2:14} Or to chiefs, as sent by him for the punishing of them doing evil, and the praise of them doing good.
{2:15} (For so is the will of God, those doing good to silence the want of knowledge of the foolish men:)
{2:16} As free, and as not having liberty for a covering of wickedness, but as the servants of God.
{2:17} Honour all. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
{2:18} Servants being subjected to masters in all fear; not only to the good and equitable, but also to the crooked.
{2:19} For this is grace, if any by consciousness of God bear grief, suffering unjustly.
{2:20} For what glory, if, sinning and being cuffed, ye endure? but if, doing good, and suffering, ye endure, this is grace with God.
{2:21} For to this were ye called: for also Christ suffered for you, leaving behind to you an underwriting, that ye should follow upon his footsteps:
{2:22} Who did no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth:
{2:23} Who, being reviled, reviled not back; suffering, he threatened not; and delivered to him judging justly;
{2:24} Who himself bear up our sins in his body upon the wood, that we, removed from sins, should live to justice: by whose bloody mark ye were healed.
{2:25} For ye were as sheep going astray; but now have turned about to the Shepherd and inspector of your souls.
{3:1} Likewise, wives being subject to their own husbands; that also, if any believe not the word, by the turning back of wives might be gained without the word;
{3:2} Having beheld in fear your pure turning back.
{3:3} Whose outside let it not be of the interweaving of hairs, and of putting round of gold, or of putting on of garments, the arrangement;
{3:4} But the hidden man of the heart, in the uncorruptedness of a mild and quiet spirit, which is before God of great price.
{3:5} For so once also the holy women, hoping in God, arranged themselves, being subjected to their own husbands:
{3:6} (As Sara listened to Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye are,) doing good, and not fearing any terror.
{3:7} Men, likewise, dwelling together according to knowledge, as showing honour to the weaker vessel, pertaining to woman, and as co-heirs of the grace of life; that your prayers be not cut off.
{3:8} And finally, all unanimous, suffering together, loving the brethren, having good bowels, an affectionate disposition:
{3:9} Not returning evil for evil, or railing for railing: and on the contrary prayer; knowing that to this were ye called, that ye might inherit praise.
{3:10} For he wishing to love life, and to see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit:
{3:11} Let him bend away from evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and follow it.
{3:12} For the eyes of the Lord upon the just, and his ears to their prayer: and the face of the Lord against them doing evil.
{3:13} And who going to injure you, if ye be imitators of good?
{3:14} But if ye also suffer for justice, happy are ye: be not afraid of their fear, neither be troubled;
{3:15} And consecrate the Lord God in your hearts: and being ready always for a justification to every one asking you the word of the hope in you with meekness and fear:
{3:16} Having a good consciousness; that, in what they speak evil against you, as doing evil, they threatening your good turning round in Christ should be ashamed.
{3:17} Fur better, doing good, if the will of God will, to suffer, than doing evil.
{3:18} For Christ also once suffered for sins, the just one for the unjust, that he might bring us near to God, truly put to death in the flesh, and made alive by the Spirit:
{3:19} In which also having gone, he proclaimed to the spirits in prison;
{3:20} They having been once unbelieving, when the longsuffering of God waited in Noah's days, the ark being prepared, in which few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.
{3:21} By which also the figure, immersion, now saves us (not by laying aside of the filth of the flesh, but the question of a good consciousness toward God,) by the rising up of Jesus Christ:
{3:22} Who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers subjected to him.
{4:1} Therefore Christ having suffered for us in the flesh, also arm ye yourselves with the same mind: (for he having suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;)
{4:2} That no more to the eager desires of men, but to the will of God, should he live the remaining time in the flesh.
{4:3} For the time of life passed over sufficient for us to have wrought the will of the nations, having gone in licentiousness, eager desires, drunkenness, revellings, drinkings, and criminal idolatries:
{4:4} In which they are astonished, you not running together in the same pouring out of lavish expense, blaspheming:
{4:5} Who shall return the word to him holding in readiness to judge the living and the dead.
{4:6} For also for this was the good news announced to the dead, that truly they might be judged according to men in the flesh, and live according to God in the spirit.
{4:7} And the end of all has drawn near: be ye therefore of sound mind, and live abstemiously in prayers.
{4:8} More than all having intent love among yourselves: for love shall cover a multitude of sins.
{4:9} Being hospitable to one another without murmurings.
{4:10} As each received favor, serving the same among yourselves, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
{4:11} If any speak, as the oracles of God; if any serve, as of the strength which God furnishes: that in all God might be praised by Jesus Christ, in whom is the glory and strength for the time of times. Amen.
{4:12} Dearly beloved, be not astonished at the refining of fire in you, being for trial to you, as a strange thing happening to you:
{4:13} But, inasmuch as ye participate in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice; that also, in the revelation of his glory, ye might rejoice, transported with joy.
{4:14} If ye be reproached in the name of Christ, ye happy; for the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you: by them truly he is defamed, and by you he is praised.
{4:15} For let not any of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or doing evil, or as an inspector, in what pertains to others.
{4:16} And if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; and let him praise God in this portion.
{4:17} For the time for judgment to have begun from the house of God: and if first from us, what the end of them not believing the good tidings of God?
{4:18} And if the just one with difficulty be saved, where shall the irreligious and sinful appear.
{4:19} Therefore let them also suffering according to the will of God commit their souls in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.
{5:1} The elders among you I beseech, a fellow elder, and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a participator of the glory which is about to be revealed:
{5:2} Tend the flock of God which among you, inspecting, not by force, but voluntarily; neither occupied in sordid gain, but of a ready will;
{5:3} Neither as ruling over the portions obtained by lot, but being types of the flock.
{5:4} And the chief Shepherd having been manifested, ye shall be attired with an unfading crown of glory.
{5:5} Likewise, ye younger, be subjected to the elders. And all being subject to one another, be wrapped up in humility: for God opposes the proud, and gives grace to the humble.
{5:6} Therefore be humbled under the strong hand of God, that he might lift you up) in due measure:
{5:7} Having cast all your care upon him; for to him is the care for you.
{5:8} Be abstemious, watch; for your adversary the accuser, as a roaring lion, walks around, seeking whom he might swallow down:
{5:9} Whom resist firm in the faith, knowing that the same of sufferings are completed by your brotherhood in the world.
{5:10} And the God of all grace, having called us to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, may he put you in proper order, having suffered a little time, may he support you, make firm, lay the foundation.
{5:11} To him the glory and the strength for the time of times. Amen.
{5:12} By Silvanus, to you the faithful brother, as I reckon, I wrote briefly, beseeching, and bearing testimony this to be the true grace of God in which ye stand.
{5:13} The chosen together in Babylon, greet you; also Marcus my son.
{5:14} Greet one another in a kiss of love. Peace to all you which in Christ Jesus. Amen.
