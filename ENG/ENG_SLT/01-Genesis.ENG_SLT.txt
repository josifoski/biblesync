{1:1} In the beginning God formed the heavens and the earth.
{1:2} And the earth was desolation and emptiness, and darkness over the face of the deep: and the spirit of God moved over the face of the waters.
{1:3} And God will say there shall be light, and there shall be light.
{1:4} And God will see the light that it is good, and God will separate between the light and between the darkness.
{1:5} And God will call to the light day, and to the darkness he called night: and the evening shall be, and the morning shall be one day.
{1:6} And God will say there shall be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and there shall be a separating between waters to waters.
{1:7} And God shall make a firmament, and he shall separate between the waters which are from the lower part of the firmament and between the waters which are from the upper part of the firmament: and it shall be so.
{1:8} And God will call to the firmament the heavens: and the evening shall be, and the morning shall be the second day.
{1:9} And God will say the waters shall be gathered together from the under part of the heavens to one place, and the dry shall be seen: and it shall be so.
{1:10} And God will call to the dry, earth; and to the gathering of the waters he called seas: and God will see that it is good.
{1:11} And God will say the earth shall bring forth the tender grass, and the green herb bearing seed, and the fruit tree making fruit according to its kind, in which is the seed in it upon the earth: and it shall be so.
{1:12} And the earth shall bring forth the tender grass, the green herb bearing seed according to its kind, and the tree making fruit in which the seed is in it, according to its kind: and God will see that it is good.
{1:13} And the evening shall be, and the morning shall be the third day.
{1:14} And God will say there shall be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate between the day and between the night: and they shall be for signs and for set times, and for days and for years.
{1:15} And they shall be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth: and it shall be so.
{1:16} And God will make two great lights; the great light for the rule of the day, and the small light for the rule of the night and the stars.
{1:17} And God will give them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth.
{1:18} And to rule in the day and in the night, and to separate between the light and between the darkness: And God will see that it is good.
{1:19} And the evening shall be, and the morning shall be the fourth day.
{1:20} And God will say the waters shall breed abundantly creeping things, the living soul, and birds shall fly over the earth, over the face of the firmament of the heavens.
{1:21} And God will form great sea monsters and every living soul creeping, which the waters bred abundantly according to their kind, and every bird of wing according to its kind: and God will see that it is good.
{1:22} And God will praise them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and birds shall multiply in the earth.
{1:23} And the evening shall be, and the morning shall be the fifth day.
{1:24} And God will say, the earth shall bring forth the living soul according to its kind, cattle and creeping things, and living things of the earth after its kind: and it shall be so.
{1:25} And God will make the living thing of the earth according to its kind, and cattle according to its kind, and every creeping thing of the earth according to its kind: and God will see that it is.
{1:26} And God will say, We will make man in our image according to our likeness, and they shall rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and every creeping thing creeping upon the earth.
{1:27} And God will form man in his image, in the image of God he formed him; male and female he formed them.
{1:28} And God will praise them, and God will say to them, be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing creeping upon the earth.
{1:29} And God will say, Lo, I gave to you every green herb scattering seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree scattering seed; to you it shall be for food.
{1:30} And to every living thing of the earth, and to all the birds of the heavens and to every thing creeping upon the earth, in which is a living soul, every green herb for food: and it shall be so.
{1:31} And God will see every thing which he made: and lo, very good and the evening shall be, and the morning shall be the sixth day.
{2:1} And the heavens and the earth shall be completed and all their army.
{2:2} And God will complete in the seventh day his work which he made, and he will rest in the seventh day from all his work which he made.
{2:3} And God will praise the seventh day, and will consecrate it, because in it he ceased from all his works which God formed to make.
{2:4} These the generations of the heavens and the earth in creating them, in the day of Jehovah God's making the earth and the heavens.
{2:5} And every green thing of the field before it shall be in the earth, and every green herb of the field before it will spring up: for Jehovah God rained not upon the earth and not a man to work the earth.
{2:6} And a vapor shall go up from the earth and it watered all the face of the earth.
{2:7} And Jehovah God will form man of the dust from the earth, and will blow into his nostrils the breath of lives, and man shall be for a living soul.
{2:8} And Jehovah God will plant a garden in Eden from the east; and he will put there the man which he will form.
{2:9} And Jehovah God will cause to grow out of the earth every tree pleasant to the sight, and good for food; and the tree of lives in the midst of the garden, and the tree to know good and evil.
{2:10} And a river shall go out from Eden to water the garden, and from thence it shall be separated into four heads.
{2:11} The name of the one, Pison: it is that surrounding all the land Havilah, where there is gold.
{2:12} And the gold of that land is good. There bdellium and onyx stone.
{2:13} And the name of the second river, Gihon: that surrounding all the land of Cush.
{2:14} And the name of the third river, Hiddekel, that going forth east of Assyria. And the fourth river, Euphrates.
{2:15} And Jehovah God will take the man and will set him down in the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it.
{2:16} And Jehovah God will appoint to the man, saying, From every tree of the garden eating, thou shalt eat.
{2:17} But from the tree to know good and evil thou shalt not eat from it, for in the day of thy eating from it, dying, thou shalt die.
{2:18} And Jehovah God will say, It is not good for man to be alone; I will make for him a help as before him.
{2:19} And Jehovah God will form out of the earth every living thing of the field, and all the birds of the heavens, and he will bring in to the man to see what he will call to it; and all which the man will call it to the living soul, that its name.
{2:20} And the man will call the names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every living thing of the field; but to the man was not found a help as before him.
{2:21} And Jehovah God will cause to fall a deep sleep upon the man, and he will sleep; and he will take one of his ribs and will close up the flesh underneath it.
{2:22} And Jehovah God will build the rib which he took from the man, into a woman, and will bring her to the man.
{2:23} And the man will say, This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh; and this shall be called woman, because she was taken from man.
{2:24} Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother and will cleave to his woman; and they shall be into one flesh.
{2:25} And they two shall be naked, the man and his woman, and they shall not be ashamed.
{3:1} And the serpent was crafty above every beast of the field which Jehovah God made; and he will say to the woman, Is it because God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
{3:2} And the woman will say to the serpent, From the fruit of the tree of the garden we shall eat.
{3:3} And from the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God said, Ye shall not eat from it, and ye shall not touch upon it, lest ye shall die.
{3:4} And the serpent will say to the woman, Dying ye shall not die.
{3:5} For God is knowing in the day of your eating from it, and your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.
{3:6} And the woman will see that the tree is good for food, and that it is a desire to the eyes, and a tree desired to make wise; and she will take from its fruit and will eat, and will give also to her man with her, and he will eat.
{3:7} And the eyes of the two shall be opened, and they shall know that they are naked; and they shall sew together the leaves of the fig tree, and shall make to themselves girdles.
{3:8} And they shall hear the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden at the breeze of the day: and Adam and his wife will hide from the face of Jehovah God in the midst of the wood of the garden.
{3:9} And Jehovah God will call to the man, and will say to him, Where art thou?
{3:10} And he will will say, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I shall be afraid, because I am naked, and I will hide myself.
{3:11} And he will say, Who showed to thee that thou art naked? Of the tree which I charged thee not to eat, didst thou eat from it?
{3:12} And the man will say, The woman which thou gavest with me, she gave to me from the tree, and I shall eat.
{3:13} And Jehovah God will say to the woman, What is this thou didst? And the woman will say, The serpent deceived me and I shall eat.
{3:14} And Jehovah God will say to the serpent, Because thou didst this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust thou shalt eat all the days of thy life.
{3:15} And I will put enmity between thee and between the woman, and between thy seed and between her seed; it shall lie in wait for thee as to the head, and thou shalt lie in wait for him as to the heel.
{3:16} To the woman he said, Multiplying, I will multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and to thy husband thy desire, and he shall rule over thee.
{3:17} And to Adam he said, Because thou didst listen to the voice of thy wife, and thou wilt eat from the tree which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat from it; cursed the earth for thy sake; in labor shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
{3:18} And thorns and weeds shall it cause to sprout forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the green herb of the field.
{3:19} In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat food until thy turning back to the earth; for out of it thou wert taken; for dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou turn back.
{3:20} And Adam will call his wife's name Life, for she was the mother of all living.
{3:21} And Jehovah God will make to Adam and to his wife, coats of skin, and will clothe them.
{3:22} And Jehovah God will say, Lo, Adam became as one from us, to know good and evil: and now lest he shall send forth his hand and take also of the tree of lives, and eat, and live to eternity:
{3:23} And Jehovah God will send him forth from the garden of Eden to work the earth which he was taken from there.
{3:24} And he will drive out Adam; and he will set up from the east of the garden of Eden, cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning itself about to keep the way of the tree of lives.
{4:1} And Adam knew Life, his wife, and she will conceive and bear Cain, and said, I obtained a man of Jehovah.
{4:2} And she will add to bear his brother Abel; and Abel shall be a feeder of sheep, and Cain was a laborer of the earth.
{4:3} And it shall be at the end of days, and Cain shall bring in from the fruit of the earth an offering to Jehovah.
{4:4} And Abel, he also brought in the first-born of his sheep, and their fat. And Jehovah will look to Abel and to his gift.
{4:5} And to Cain and to his offering he looked not: and Cain will be very angry, and his countenance will fall.
{4:6} And Jehovah will say to Cain, Why art thou angry, and why does thy countenance fall?
{4:7} If thou shalt do well thou shalt be lifted up; and if thou shalt not do well, sin lies at the entrance; and to thee his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
{4:8} And Cain will speak to Abel his brother; and it shall be in their being in the field, Cain will rise up against Abel his brother, and will kill him.
{4:9} And Jehovah will say to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? and he will say, I know not: am I my brother's watcher?
{4:10} And he will say, What didst thou? the voice of thy brother's bloods, crying out to me from the earth.
{4:11} And now cursed art thou, from the earth, which opened her mouth to take thy brother's bloods from thy hand.
{4:12} When thou shalt work the earth she shall not add to give her strength to thee. Wandering and fleeing shalt thou be in the earth.
{4:13} And Cain will say to Jehovah, My sin is great, above bearing.
{4:14} Lo, thou didst drive me out this day from above the face of the earth, and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be wandering and fleeing in the earth; and it shall be, every one finding me will kill me.
{4:15} And Jehovah will say to him, Therefore, every one killing Cain, he shall be avenged seven fold. And Jehovah will put a sign upon Cain, lest any finding him, smite him.
{4:16} And Cain went out from the face of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, eastward of Eden.
{4:17} And Cain will know his wife, and she will conceive and bear Enoch: and he will be building a city, and will call the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.
{4:18} And to Enoch shall be born Irad; and Irad begat Mehujael; and Mehujael begat Methusael; and Methusael begat Lamech.
{4:19} And Lamech shall take to him two women: the name of the one Adah, and the name of the second, Zillah.
{4:20} And Adah will bear Jabal; he was the father of him remaining in the tent, and riches.
{4:21} And his brother's name Jubal; he was father of all laying hold of the harp and pipe.
{4:22} And Zillah, she also will bear Tubal Cain, sharpening every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and Tubal Cain's sister was Naamah.
{4:23} And Lamech will say his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, and give ear to my word: for I killed a man to my wound, and a son to my cutting.
{4:24} If Cain shall be avenged seven fold, also Lamech seventy and seven.
{4:25} And Adam will know his wife again, and she will bear a son, and she will call his name Seth: for God set me a second seed instead of Abel, for Cain slew him.
{4:26} And to Seth, to him also a son shall be born, and he will call his name Enos: then it was begun to call in the name of Jehovah.
{5:1} This the writing of the generations of Adam: in the day God formed Adam, in the likeness of God, he made him.
{5:2} Male and female he formed them; and he will bless them, and will call their name Adam in the day they are created.
{5:3} And Adam shall live thirty and one hundred years, and shall beget in his likeness, according to his image, and will call his name Seth.
{5:4} And the days of Adam after his begetting Seth shall be eight hundred years: and he shall beget sons and daughters.
{5:5} And all the days which Adam lived shall be nine hundred years and thirty years, and he shall die.
{5:6} And Seth shall live five years and a hundred years, and he shall beget Enos.
{5:7} And Seth shall live after his begetting Enos, seven years and eight hundred years: and he shall beget sons and daughters.
{5:8} And all the days of Seth shall be twelve years and Tune hundred years: and he shall die.
{5:9} And Enos shall live ninety years and shall beget Kainan.
{5:10} And Enos shall live after his begetting Kainan, fifteen years and eight hundred years: and he shall beget sons and daughters.
{5:11} And all the days of Enos shall be five years and nine hundred years, and he shall die.
{5:12} And Kainan shall live seventy years and shall beget Mahalaleel.
{5:13} And Kainan shall live after his begetting Mahalaleel, forty years and and eight hundred years: and shall beget sons and daughters.
{5:14} And all the days of Kainan shall be ten years and nine hundred years, and he shall die.
{5:15} And Mahalaleel shall live five years and sixty years, and he shall beget Jared.
{5:16} And Mahalaleel shall live after his begetting Jared, thirty years and eight hundred years; and he shall beget sons and daughters.
{5:17} And all the days of Mahalaleel shall be five and ninety years and eight hundred years, and he shall die.
{5:18} And Jared shall live two and sixty years, and an hundred years, and he shall beget Enoch.
{5:19} And Jared shall live after his begetting Enoch, eight hundred years, and shall beget sons and daughters.
{5:20} And all the years of Jared shall be two and sixty years and nine hundred years, and he shall die.
{5:21} And Enoch shall live five and sixty years, and he shall beget Methuselah.
{5:22} And Enoch shall walk with God after his begetting Methuselah, three hundred years, and he shall beget sons and daughters.
{5:23} And all the days of Enoch shall be five and sixty years and three hundred years.
{5:24} And Enoch shall walk with God, and be not, for God took him.
{5:25} And Methuselah shall live seven and eighty years and a hundred years, and he shall beget Lamech.
{5:26} And Methuselah shall live after his begetting Lamech, two and eighty years and seven hundred years, and he shall beget sons and daughters.
{5:27} And all the days of Methuselah shall be nine and sixty years and nine hundred years, and he shall die.
{5:28} Ana Lamech shall live two and eighty years and a hundred years, and he shall beget a son.
{5:29} And he shall call his name Noah, saying, This shall console us from our work and from the labor of our hands because of the earth which Jehovah cursed it.
{5:30} And Lamech shall live after the begetting of Noah five and ninety years and five hundred years, and he shall beget sons and daughters.
{5:31} And all the days of Lamech shall be seven and seventy years and seven hundred years, and he shall die.
{5:32} And Noah shall be the son of five hundred years, and Noah shall beget Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
{6:1} And it shall be when man begins to multiply upon the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,
{6:2} And the sons of God will see the daughters of Adam that they are good, and they will take to them wives of all which they chose.
{6:3} And Jehovah will say, My spirit will not forever be low in man, for that he is flesh and his days were one hundred and twenty years.
{6:4} Giants were in the earth in these days, and also after that, when the sons of God shall come in to the daughters of man and they shall bring forth to them which are men of old, men of name.
{6:5} And Jehovah will see that great the evil of man in the earth, and every formation of the thoughts of his heart only evil all the days.
{6:6} And Jehovah will lament that he made man in the earth, and he will be grieved at his heart.
{6:7} And Jehovah will say, I will wipe out man whom I formed from above the face of the earth; from man even to cattle, even to the creeping thing and even to the birds of the heavens; and I was grieved that I made them.
{6:8} And Noah found grace in the eyes of Jehovah.
{6:9} These the generations of Noah; a just man, and was complete in his generations: Noah walked with God.
{6:10} And Noah shall beget three sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth.
{6:11} And the earth shall be corrupted to the face of God; and the earth shall be filled with violence.
{6:12} And God shall see the earth, and lo, it was corrupted, for all flesh corrupted its way upon the earth.
{6:13} And God will say to Noah, The end of all flesh came in to my face, for the earth was filled with violence from the face of them, and behold me destroying them from the earth.
{6:14} Make to thee a box of pitch wood; nests shalt thou make in the ark, and cover it from within and from without with pitch.
{6:15} And this which thou shalt make it, three hundred cubits the length of the ark; fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height.
{6:16} Light shall thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou complete it from the ascent; and the entrance of the ark thou shalt set in its side; the lower parts the two and the three shalt thou make.
{6:17} And I, lo I, will bring in an inundation of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life from underneath the heavens; all which is in the earth shall die.
{6:18} And I set up my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come in to the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
{6:19} And from every living thing of all flesh, two of all shalt thou bring in to the ark, to preserve alive with thee: male and female shall they be.
{6:20} From birds according to its kind, and cattle according to their kind; of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two from all shall come to thee to preserve alive.
{6:21} And take thou to thee of all food which shall be eaten, and thou shalt collect to thee, and it shall be to thee and to them for food.
{6:22} And Noah will do all which God commanded him; so did he.
{7:1} And Jehovah will say to Noah, Come thou, and all thy house into the ark, for thee I saw just to my face in this generation.
{7:2} From all clean cattle thou shalt take to thee seven; seven male and female; and from cattle which are not clean, this two, male and female.
{7:3} Also of birds of the heavens, seven: seven male and female, to preserve alive seed upon the face of all the earth.
{7:4} For yet seven days, and I will give rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights: and I will wipe out every living thing which I made from the face of the earth.
{7:5} And Noah will do according to all which Jehovah commanded him.
{7:6} And Noah the son of six hundred years, and the flood of waters was upon the earth.
{7:7} And Noah shall come in, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him to the ark from the face of the water of the flood.
{7:8} From clean beasts, and from cattle which are not clean, and from birds and all which creeps upon the earth.
{7:9} Two and two went in to Noah to the ark, male and female, according to which God commanded Noah.
{7:10} And it shall be seven days; and the waters of the flood shall be upon the earth.
{7:11} In the year of six hundred years of Noah's life, in the second month, in the seventeenth day of the month, in the same day all the fountains of the great deep were divided and the sluices of the heavens were opened.
{7:12} And the rain shall be upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
{7:13} In that very day went in Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth; Noah's sons, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them to the ark.
{7:14} They, and every living thing after its kind, and all cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing creeping upon the earth, after its kind, and every bird after his kind, and every small bird of every wing.
{7:15} And they shall go in to Noah to the ark, two from all flesh in which is the breath of life.
{7:16} And they going in, went in male and female from all flesh according to which God commanded him: and Jehovah shut him within.
{7:17} And the flood shall be forty days upon the earth, and the waters shall multiply, and shall take up the ark, and it shall be lifted up from above the earth.
{7:18} And the waters shall prevail and shall multiply exceedingly upon the earth: and the ark shall go upon the face of the waters.
{7:19} And the waters prevailed exceedingly exceedingly upon the earth: and all the high mountains which are underneath all the heavens shall be covered.
{7:20} Fifteen cubits from upward, the waters prevailed: and will cover the mountains.
{7:21} And all flesh shall die that creeping upon the earth, with birds and with cattle and with beast and with every creeping thing that creeping upon the earth, and every man.
{7:22} All which the breath of the spirit of life in the nostrils of all which is in the dry land died.
{7:23} And every living thing shall be wiped off which upon the face of the earth, from man even to cattle, even to the creeping thing, and even to the birds of the heavens; and they shall be wiped out from the earth, and Noah only shall remain and they which with him in the ark.
{7:24} And the waters shall prevail upon the earth fifty and one hundred days.
{8:1} And God will remember Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that with him in the ark: and God will make a wind to pass over the earth and the waters will settle down.
{8:2} And the fountains of the deep, and the sluices of the heavens shall be shut up, and the rains from the heavens shall be withheld.
{8:3} And the waters shall turn back from over the earth, going and turning back, and the waters shall fail from the end of fifty and one hundred days.
{8:4} And the ark shall rest in the seventh month in the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of Ararat.
{8:5} And the waters were going and diminishing until the tenth month: in the tenth, in the one of the month, the heads of the mountains were seen.
{8:6} And it shall be from the end of forty days Noah shall open the window of the ark which he made.
{8:7} And he shall send forth the raven, and it shall go forth, going and turning back, till the waters dry up from over the earth.
{8:8} And he shall send forth the dove from with him to see if the waters were diminished from the face of the earth.
{8:9} And the dove found not rest to the hollow of her foot, and she will turn back to him to the ark, for the waters are over the face of all the earth; and he will send forth his hand and will take her and will cause her to come to him to the ark.
{8:10} And he will wait yet again other seven days, and he will add to send forth the dove from the ark.
{8:11} And the dove will come in to him at the time of evening, and lo, an olive leaf plucked off, in her mouth. And Noah will know that the waters were diminished from over the earth.
{8:12} And he will wait yet again, other seven days, and will send forth the dove; and she will not add to turn back to him yet again.
{8:13} And it shall be in the one and six hundredth year, in the beginning, in one of the month, the waters were diminished from over the earth: and Noah will turn away the covering of the ark, and he will see and behold the face of the earth was dry.
{8:14} And in the second month, in the seven and twentieth day of the month, the earth shall be dry.
{8:15} And God will speak to Noah, saying,
{8:16} Come forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons and thy sons' wives with thee.
{8:17} Every living thins which is with thee, from all flesh, of birds and of cattle, and of every creeping thing creeping upon the earth, bring forth with thee, and increase ye abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.
{8:18} And Noah shall come forth, and his sons and his wife, and his sons' wives with him.
{8:19} Every living thing, every creeping thing, and every bird, every thing creeping upon the earth according to their families shall come forth from the ark.
{8:20} And Noah will build an altar to Jehovah, and will take from all clean cattle, and from all clean birds, and will bring up a burnt offering upon the altar.
{8:21} And Jehovah smelled a smell of sweetness; and Jehovah will say in his heart, I will not gather to curse the earth yet again on account of man; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth: and I will not gather yet again to smite every living thing according to which I did.
{8:22} Yet all the days of the earth, seed and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
{9:1} And God will praise Noah and his sons, and will say to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.
{9:2} And the fear of you, and the dread of you, shall be upon every living thing of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens, upon every thing which shall creep along the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand they were given.
{9:3} Every creeping thing which it lives shall be food to you as the green herb. I gave you all things.
{9:4} But the flesh with its breath, its blood ye shall not eat.
{9:5} And surely, your blood of your lives I will search out, from the hand of every living thing I will search it out, and from the hand of man; from the hand of a man's brother I will search out the life of man.
{9:6} He pouring out man's blood, by man his blood shall be poured out: for in the image of God he made man.
{9:7} And you, be ye fruitful and multiply, and increase abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it.
{9:8} And God will speak to Noah and to his sons, saying,
{9:9} And I, behold I establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you.
{9:10} And with every breathing thing which is with you, of birds, of cattle, and of every living thing of the earth with you, from all going out of the ark, to every living thing of the earth.
{9:11} And I established my covenant with you; and all flesh shall not be dissipated any more by the waters of a flood and there shall not be any more a flood to destroy the earth.
{9:12} And God will say, This is a sign of the covenant which I give between me and between you, and between every breathing thing living which is with you for future generations.
{9:13} I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between me and between the earth.
{9:14} And it shall be in my giving a cloud upon the earth, and the bow was seen in the cloud.
{9:15} And I remembered my covenant which is between me and between you, and between every breathing thing living of all flesh; and the waters shall not any more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
{9:16} The bow shall be in the cloud; and seeing it to remember the lasting covenant between God and between every breathing thing living of all flesh which is upon the earth.
{9:17} And God will say to Noah, This the sign of the covenant which I established between me and between all flesh which is upon the earth.
{9:18} And the sons of Noah going forth from the ark shall be Shem and Ham and Japheth; and Ham he the father of Canaan.
{9:19} These the three sons of Noah; and from these was the whole earth disseminated.
{9:20} And Noah will begin a man of the earth, and he will plant a vineyard.
{9:21} And he will drink of the wine and he will be intoxicated, and will be uncovered within his tent.
{9:22} And Ham the father of Canaan will see the nakedness of his father, and he will declare to his two brethren without.
{9:23} And Shem and Japheth will take a garment and they will put upon their two shoulders, and will go backwards and will cover the nakedness of their father: and their faces backwards, and they will not see the nakedness of their father.
{9:24} And Noah will awake from his wine and will know what his young son did to him.
{9:25} And he will say, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren.
{9:26} And he will say, Praised Jehovah, God of Shem; Canaan shall be servant to him.
{9:27} God will dilate Japheth; he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be servant to him.
{9:28} And Noah shall live after the flood three hundred years and fifty years.
{9:29} And all the days of Noah shall be nine hundred years and fifty years: and he shall die.
{10:1} These the generations of the sons of Noah; Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And sons shall be born to them after the flood.
{10:2} The sons of Japheth; Gomer and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
{10:3} And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
{10:4} And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Chittim and Dodanirn.
{10:5} By these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands; a man according to his tongue, according to their tribe, in their nations.
{10:6} And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
{10:7} And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha; and the sons of Raamah; Sheba and Dedan.
{10:8} And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be strong in the earth.
{10:9} He was a strong taker of prey before the face of Jehovah; for this he will say, As Nimrod the strong hunter before the face of Jehovah.
{10:10} And the beginning of his kingdom shall be Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
{10:11} From that land shall come forth Asshur, and shall build Nineveh, and the city Reheboth, and Calah,
{10:12} And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: this a great city.
{10:13} And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim.
{10:14} And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (which from the same came Philistine) and Caphtorim.
{10:15} And Caanan will beget Sidon, his first-born, and Heth,
{10:16} And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,
{10:17} And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
{10:18} And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward the families of the Canaanites were dispersed.
{10:19} And the bound of the Canaanite shall be from Sidon in thy coming to Gerar, to Azzah; in thy coming to Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even to Lasha.
{10:20} These the sons of Hain according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.
{10:21} And to Shem shall be born, even to him the father of all the sons of Eber, the brother of Japheth the great.
{10:22} The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaeshad, and Lud, and Aram.
{10:23} And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
{10:24} And Arphaeshad shall beget Shelah, and Shelah shall beget Eber.
{10:25} And to Eber shall be born two sons: the name of the latter, Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and the name of his brother, Joktan.
{10:26} And Joktan will beget Ahnodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
{10:27} And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
{10:28} And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
{10:29} And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these the sons of Joktan.
{10:30} And their dwelling shall be from Mesha, in thy going to Sephar, a mountain of the east.
{10:31} These the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, according to their nations.
{10:32} These the families of Noah after their generations, in their nations and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
{11:1} And all the earth shall be one lip, and the same words.
{11:2} And it shall be in their removing from the east they shall find a valley in the land of Shmar; and they shall dwell there.
{11:3} And they shall say a man to his neighbor, Come, we will make bricks, and we will burn to a burning, and brick shall be to them for stone, and potter's clay shall be to them for potter's clay.
{11:4} And they will say, Come, we will build to us a city, and a tower, its head to the heavens; and we will make to us a name, lest we shall be dispersed over the face of the earth.
{11:5} And Jehovah will come down to see the city, and the tower which the sons of men built.
{11:6} And Jehovah will say, Behold, the people one, and one lip to them all; and this they begin to do: and now it will not be restrained from them all which they shall imagine to do.
{11:7} Come, we will come down and mix their lip that they shall not hear a man the lip of his neighbor.
{11:8} And Jehovah will disperse them from thence over the face of all the earth: and they will cease to build the city.
{11:9} Therefore its name was called confusion, for there Jehovah confounded the lip of all the earth: and from thence Jehovah dispersed them over the face of all the earth.
{11:10} These the generations of Shem: Shem the son of a hundred years, and he will beget Arphaeshad, two years after the flood.

{11:25} And Nahor will live after his begetting Terah, nineteen years and a hundred years, and he will beget sons and daughters.
{11:26} And Terah will live seventy years and will beget Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
{11:27} And these the generations of Terah: Terah begetting Abram, Nahor, and Haran: and Haran begetting Lot.
{11:28} And Haran will die at the face of Terah his father in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees.
{11:29} And Abram and Nahor will take to them wives, the name of Abram's wife Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
{11:30} And Sarai shall be barren; to her not a child.
{11:31} And Terah will take Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife, and they shall come forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to move to the land of Canaan and they will come to Haran, and will dwell there.
{11:32} And the days of Haran shall be five years and two hundred years; and Terah shall die in Haran.
{12:1} And Jehovah will say to Abram, Go for thyself from thy land, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, to the land which I will shew thee.
{12:2} And I will make thee into a great nation, and I will bless thee, and I will make thy name great; and thou shalt be blessed.
{12:3} And I will praise them praising thee, and I will curse him cursing thee, and in thee shall all the families of the earth be praised.
{12:4} And Abram went according to which Jehovah spake to him, and Lot went with him: and Abram the son of five years and seventy years in his coming out of Haran.
{12:5} And Abram will take Sand his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their riches which they acquired, and the souls which they acquired in Haran, and they came forth to go into the land of Canaan; and they shall come into the land of Canaan.
{12:6} And Abram shall pass over the land to the place Sichem, to the erect oak tree. And the Canaanite then in the land.
{12:7} And Jehovah shall be seen to Abram, and will say, To thy seed will I give this land, and he will build there an altar to Jehovah, being seen to him.
{12:8} And he will remove from thence to the mountain from the cast of the house of God, and shall stretch forth his tent; Bethel from the sea, and Hai from the east, and he shall build there an altar to Jehovah, and will call upon the name of Jehovah.
{12:9} And Abram will remove, going and removing to the desert.
{12:10} And there shall be a famine in the land; and Abram will go down to Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was strong in the land.
{12:11} And it shall be when he came near to go to Egypt, he will say to Sarai his wife, Behold, now I knew that thou wert a fair woman to see.
{12:12} And it shall be when the Egyptians shall see thee, they shall say, This is his wife; and they will kill me, and thee they will permit to live.
{12:13} Say, now, thou my sister, that it shall be well to me because of thee, and my soul shall live by means of thee.
{12:14} And it shall be when Abram goes to Egypt, and the Egyptians will see the woman that she was very fair.
{12:15} And Pharaoh's rulers will see her, and will praise her to Pharaoh, and the woman shall be taken into Pharaoh's house.
{12:16} And he will do good to Abram on account of her; and there shall be to him sheep and oxen and he-asses, and servants and maids, and she-asses and camels.
{12:17} And Jehovah will touch Pharaoh with great strokes, and his house on account of Sarai, Abram's wife.
{12:18} And Pharaoh will call to Abram, and will say, What this thou didst to me? why didst thou not declare to me that she is thy wife?
{12:19} Why saidst thou, She is my sister and I shall take her to me for a wife? and now behold thy wife, take and go.
{12:20} And Pharaoh will command the men concerning him, and they will send him away, and his wife and all that is to him.
{13:1} And Abram shall go up from Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that is to him, and Lot with him, to the desert.
{13:2} And Abram was very abundant in cattle, in silver and in gold.
{13:3} And Abram shall go his journey from the desert to the house of God to the place which was there his tent in the beginning, between Bethel and between Hai;
{13:4} To the place of the altar which he made there in the beginning; and there he will call on the name of Jehovah.
{13:5} And to Lot also going with Abram, were sheep and oxen and tents.
{13:6} And the land supported them not to dwell together, for their acquisition was a multitude, and they were not able to dwell together.
{13:7} And there shall be a strife between the shepherds of Abram's cattle, and between the shepherds of Lot's cattle; and the Canaanite and the Perizzite then dwelt in the land.
{13:8} And Abram will say to Lot, Now there shall not be strife between me and between thee, and between my shepherds and between thy shepherds, for we are men brethren.
{13:9} Is not all the land before thy face? Now be separated from me; if to the left hand, I will go to the right; and if to the right hand, I will go to the left.
{13:10} And Lot will lift his eyes and will see all the environs of Jordan, that all was watered, before that Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, as the garden of Jehovah as the land of Egypt in thy coming to Zoar.
{13:11} And Lot shall choose to him all the environs of Jordan: and Lot will remove from the east and they shall be separated each from his brother.
{13:12} Abram shall dwell in the land of Canaan, and Lot shall dwell in the cities of the country round about, and will pitch the tent at Sodom.
{13:13} And the men of Sodom were evil and sinful before Jehovah exceedingly.
{13:14} And Jehovah said to Abram after Lot separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes and see from the place which thou art there to the north and the desert, and the east and the sea.
{13:15} For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever.
{13:16} And I made thy seed as the dust of the earth, that if a man shall be able to reckon up the dust of the earth, thy seed also shall be reckoned up.
{13:17} Arise to walk in the land according to its length and according to its breadth; for to thee will I give it.
{13:18} And Abram will pitch his tent, and will come and will dwell by the oaks of Mamra which is in Hebron, and he will build there an altar to Jehovah.
{14:1} And it shall be in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch king of Alasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of nations,
{14:2} Made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber, king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela, this is Zoar.
{14:3} All these joined together in the valley of Siddim; this is the sea of salt.
{14:4} Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and the thirteenth year they revolted.
{14:5} And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and they shall smite the Rephaims in Ashtaroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim.
{14:6} And the Horites in their mountain Seir to Ael Paran, which is by the wilderness.
{14:7} And they shall turn back and shall come to En-Mishpat; this is Kadesh; and they shall smite all the field of the Amalekites and also of the Amorites dwelling in Hazezon Tamar.
{14:8} And there shall come forth the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela (this is Zoar), and they shall set in array with them the war in the valley of Siddim,
{14:9} With Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal, king of nations, and Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Alasar; four kings with five.
{14:10} And the valley of Siddim, pit, pit of pitch; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah shall flee and shall fall there; and those having remained shall flee to the mountain.
{14:11} And they will take all the substance of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and will go away.
{14:12} And they shall take Lot and his substance, the son of Abram's brother, and will go away, and he will dwell in Sodom.
{14:13} And he having escaped, will come and declare to Abram, the Hebrew; and he dwelt by the oaks of Mamra, the Amorite, the brother of Eshcol, and the brother of Aner: and these having a covenant with Abram.
{14:14} And Abram shall hear that his brother was carried away captive, and he will draw forth his trained, born in his house, eighteen and three hundred, and will pursue, even to Dan.
{14:15} And he will divide against them at night, he and his servants, and will smite them, and will pursue them even to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
{14:16} And he shall turn back all the substance, and also Lot, his brother, and having turned back his cattle, and also the women and the people.
{14:17} And the king of Sodom shall come forth to his meeting (after his return from the destroying of Chedorlaomer and the kings which were with him) at the valley of Shaveh; this is the king's valley.
{14:18} And Melchise-dek, king of Salem, bringing forth bread and wine: and he is priest of the most high God.
{14:19} And he will bless him, and will say, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessing the heavens and the earth.
{14:20} And praised be the most high God who delivered thine oppressors into thy hand; and he will give him of the tenth of all.
{14:21} And the king of Sodom will say to Abram, Give to me the living creature, and take the substance to thyself.
{14:22} And Abram will say to the king of Sodom, I lifted up my hand to Jehovah God the most high, possessing the heavens and the earth.
{14:23} If from a line and to a shoe-string and if I shall take from all which is to thee, and thou shalt not say I enriched Abram:
{14:24} Nothing yet for me except what the young men ate, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamra; they shall take their portion.
{15:1} After these words, the word of Jehovah was to Abram in a vision, saying, Thou shalt not fear, Abram: I a shield to thee, thy reward great exceedingly.
{15:2} And Abram will say, My Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give to me, and I going childless, and the son of Masek in my house, he Eliezer of Damascus?
{15:3} And Abram will say, Behold, to me thou gavest no seed, and behold the son of my house shall inherit me.
{15:4} And behold, the word of Jehovah was to him, saying, This shall not inherit thee, for truly he who shall come forth from thy bowels shall inherit thee.
{15:5} And he will bring him forth without, and will say, Now look to the heavens and count the stars, if thou shalt be able to count them: and he will say to him, So shall be thy seed.
{15:6} And he believed in Jehovah; and it shall be reckoned to him justice.
{15:7} And he will say to him, I am Jehovah who brought thee from Ur of the Chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it.
{15:8} And he will say, My Lord Jehovah, how shall I know that I shall inherit it?
{15:9} And he will say to him, Take to me a heifer of three, and a goat of three, and a ram of three, and a turtle dove, and a young pigeon.
{15:10} And he will take to him all these, and he will divide them, asunder in the midst, and will put each of its parts divided, opposite its companion: and the birds he divided not.
{15:11} And the birds will come down upon the dead carcases, and Abram will drive them together.
{15:12} And the sun shall be going down, and a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and behold terror and great darkness fell upon him.
{15:13} And he will say to Abram, Knowing thou shalt know that thy seed shall be a sojourner in the land not to them; and they shall serve them and they shall humble them four hundred years.
{15:14} And also the nation whom they shall serve, I will judge, and after this they shall come forth with great substance.
{15:15} And thou shalt go to thy fathers in tranquillity; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
{15:16} And the fourth generation they shall turn back hither: for the crime of the Amorite has not been completed till now.
{15:17} And the sun shall be going down, and it was thick darkness, and behold a furnace of smoke and a lamp of fire that passed over between these pieces.
{15:18} In that day Jehovah cut out a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy seed gave I this land from the river of Egypt, to the great river, the river Euphrates:
{15:19} The Kenites and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites;
{15:20} The Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims;
{15:21} And the Amorites and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
{16:1} And Sarai, Abram's wife, brought not forth to him; and to her a maid servant, an Egyptian, and her name Hagar.
{16:2} And Sarai will say to Abram, Behold now, Jehovah restrained me from bringing forth; go now to my maid servant; perhaps I shall have children from her. And Abram will listen to the voice of Sarai.
{16:3} And Sarai, Abram's wife, will take Hagar the Egyptian, her maid servant, at the end of ten years of Abram's resting in the land of Canaan, and will give her to Abram her husband, to him for a wife.
{16:4} And Abram will go in to Hagar, and she will conceive, and she will see that she conceived; and her mistress will be despised in her eyes.
{16:5} And Sarai will say to Abram, My wrong upon thee: I gave my maid servant into thy bosom, and she will see that she conceived, and I shall be despised in her eyes. Jehovah will judge between me and between thee.
{16:6} And Abram will say to Sarai, Behold thy maid servant in thy hand; do to her the good in thine eyes. And Sarai shall afflict her, and she will flee from her face.
{16:7} And the messenger of Jehovah shall find her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
{16:8} And he will say, Hagar, Sarai's maid servant, how camest thou here? and whither wilt thou go? And she will say, I flee from the face of Sarai, my mistress.
{16:9} And the messenger of Jehovah will say to her, Turn back to thy mistress and be humbled under her hands.
{16:10} And the messenger of Jehovah will say to her, Multiplying, I will multiply thy seed, and it shall not be counted for multitude.
{16:11} And the messenger of Jehovah will say to her, Behold, thou being great with child, and will bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael, for Jehovah listened to thy humiliation.
{16:12} And he shall be an unrestrained man; his hand against every one, and every one's hand against him; and before the face of all his brethren shall he dwell.
{16:13} And she will call the name of Jehovah, having spoken to her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Here also I looked after him seeing me.
{16:14} For this, the well was called, The well of him seeing me; behold, between Kadesh and between Bered.
{16:15} And Hagar brought forth a son to Abram, and Abram shall call his name which Hagar brought forth, Ishmael.
{16:16} And Abram the son of eighty years and six years, in Hagar's bearing Ishmael to Abram.
{17:1} And Abram shall be the son of ninety years and nine years: Jehovah shall be seen to Abram and will say to him, I am God Almighty; walk thou before me, and be complete.
{17:2} And I will give my covenant between me and between thee, and I will multiply thee with might exceedingly.
{17:3} And Abram will fall upon his face, and God will speak to him, saying,
{17:4} I, behold my covenant with thee, thou being father of a multitude of nations.
{17:5} And thy name shall no more be called Abram, and thy name shall be Abraham, for the father of a multitude of nations have I given thee.
{17:6} And I made thee fruitful with might exceedingly, and I gave thee for nations, and kings shall come forth from thee.
{17:7} And I set up my covenant between me and between thee, and between thy seed after thee to their generations for a covenant of eternity; to be a God to thee and to thy seed after thee.
{17:8} And I gave to thee and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings with all the land of Canaan for an eternal possession; and I was God to them.
{17:9} And God will say to Abraham, Thou shalt watch my covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee to their generations.
{17:10} This my covenant which ye shall watch between me and between you, and between thy seed after thee; every male among you to be circumcised.
{17:11} And ye circumcised the flesh of your uncircumcision; and it was for a sign of the covenant between me and between you.
{17:12} And the son of eight days shall be circumcised, every male of your generations being born in the house, and he bought with silver, from every son of the stranger which is not of thy seed.
{17:13} He shall be circumcised with circumcising, he being born in thy house, and bought with thy silver: and my covenant was in your flesh for an eternal covenant.
{17:14} And the uncircumcised male which shall not be circumcised in the flesh of his uncircumcision, and that soul shall be cut off from its people: he broke my covenant.
{17:15} And God will say to Abraham, Sarai, thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, for Sarah her name.
{17:16} And I blessed her, and I gave thee also a son of her: and I blessed her and she was for nations, and kings of people shall be from her.
{17:17} And Abraham will fall upon his face and laugh, and will say in his heart, Shall there be born to the son of a hundred years? and shall Sarah the daughter of ninety years, bring forth?
{17:18} And Abraham will say to God, O for Ishmael to live before thee.
{17:19} And God will say. Truly, Sarah thy wife, shall bring forth to thee a son, and shall call his name Isaak: and I set up my covenant with him for a lasting covenant, and to his seed after him.
{17:20} And for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I blessed him and made him fruitful, and I multiplied him with might exceedingly: twelve chiefs shall he beget, and I will give him into a great nation.
{17:21} And my covenant will I set up with Isaak whom Sarah shall bring forth to thee at this appointed time in another year.
{17:22} And he will finish speaking with him, and God will go up from Abraham.
{17:23} And Abraham will take Ishmael his son, and all born in his house and bought with his silver, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and he will circumcise the flesh of their uncircumcision, in the self-same day, according to which God spake to him.
{17:24} And Abraham, the son of ninety and nine years in his circumcising the flesh of his uncircumcision.
{17:25} And Ishmael his son, the son of thirteen years in his circumcising the flesh of his uncircumcision.
{17:26} And in the self-same day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son;
{17:27} And all the men of his house, born in his house, and bought with silver of the son of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
{18:1} And Jehovah will be seen to him at the oaks of Mamra: and he will sit at the entrance of his tent at the heat of the day.
{18:2} And he shall lift up his eyes and shall see, and behold, three men stood by him: and he will see and will run to meet them from the door of the tent, and will bow himself to the earth.
{18:3} And he will say, Lord, if now I found grace in thine eyes, now thou wilt not pass away from thy servant.
{18:4} Now he shall take a little water, and will wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
{18:5} And I will take a bit of food, and strengthen your heart, afterwards ye shall pass away; for, for this ye passed over to your servant And they will say, Thou shalt do according to what thou saidst.
{18:6} And Abraham will hasten to the tent to Sarah, and will say, Hasten thou measures of the finest flour; knead and make cakes.
{18:7} And Abraham running to the oxen, will take the son of a cow, tender and good, and will give to the youth, and he will hasten to do it.
{18:8} And he will take curdled milk, and new milk, and the son of the cow which he did, and he will give before their face; and he stood by them under the tree, and they shall eat.
{18:9} And they will say to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? and he will say, Behold, in the tent.
{18:10} And he will say, Returning, I will return to thee according to the time of life; and behold, a son to Sarah thy wife. And Sarah heard at the door of the tent, and she behind him.
{18:11} And Abraham and Sarah were old, being gone in days; the way according to women ceased to be to Sarah.
{18:12} And Sarah will laugh within her, saying, After it has not been to me till now, and my lord, being old.
{18:13} And Jehovah will say to Abraham, For what did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall truly even I bring forth, and I have become old?
{18:14} Shall the word of Jehovah be difficult, at the appointed time? I will return to thee, according to the time of life, and a son to Sarah.
{18:15} And Sarah will deny, saying, I did not laugh; for she was afraid. And he will say, Nay, for thou didst laugh.
{18:16} And the men will rise up from thence, and will look forth upon the face of Sodom: and Abraham went forth with them to accompany them.
{18:17} And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I do?
{18:18} And Abraham being, shall be for a great and numerous nation, and all the nations of the earth shall bless themselves in him.
{18:19} For I know him, for that he will command his sons and his house after him; and they watched the way of Jehovah to do justice and judgment, for Jehovah to bring upon Abraham what he spake to him.
{18:20} And Jehovah will say, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah became great, and because their sin was exceedingly heavy,
{18:21} I will go now and see whether they did wholly according to its cry coming to me; and if not, I shall know.
{18:22} And the men will turn back from thence, and will go forth to Sodom: and Abraham stood yet before the face of Jehovah.
{18:23} And Abraham will draw near, and will say, Wilt thou also destroy the just with the wicked.
{18:24} Perhaps there is fifty just in the midst of the city: wilt thou also destroy and not forgive the place for the sake of the fifty just which are within it?
{18:25} Far be it with respect to thee doing as this word to kill the just with the wicked; and for the just to be as the wicked, far be it with respect to thee: shall not the judge of all the earth do judgment?
{18:26} And Jehovah will say, If I shall find in Sodom fifty just, in the midst of the city, I forgive all the place for their sakes.
{18:27} And Abraham will answer and say, Behold now, I have undertaken to speak to my Lord, and I dust and ashes.
{18:28} If the fifty just shall lack five: wilt thou destroy for sake of five all the city? And he will say, I will not destroy, if I shall find there forty and five.
{18:29} And he added yet to speak to him, and he will say, If forty shall be found there? And he will say, I will not do for sake of forty.
{18:30} And he will say, Now will it not kindle to the Lord, and I will speak: If thirty shall be found there? And he will say, I will not do, if I shall find thirty there.
{18:31} And he will say, Behold now, I have begun to speak to the Lord If twenty shall be found there? And he will say, I will not destroy for sake of twenty.
{18:32} And he will say, Now will it not be angry to the Lord, and I will speak only this once: If ten shall be found there? And he will say, I will not destroy for sake of ten.
{18:33} And Jehovah went forth after that he finished to speak to Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.
{19:1} And two messengers shall come to Sodom in the evening; and Lot will sit in the gate of Sodom; and Lot will see, and will rise up to meet them, and will bow himself with the face to the earth.
{19:2} And he will say, Behold now, lords, turn aside now to the house of your servant, and pass the night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise early and go forth to your ways. And they will say, Nay; for in the street we will pass the night.
{19:3} And he will press upon them greatly; and they will turn aside to him, and they will come in to his house; and he will make to them a drinking, and he baked unleavened loaves, and they will eat.
{19:4} Before the men of the city shall lie down, the men of Sodom surrounded the house about, from youth, even to old age, all the people from the end.
{19:5} And they will call to Lot, and will say to him, Where the men which came to thee this night? bring them out to us and we shall know them.
{19:6} And Lot went forth to them to the entrance, and shut the door after him,
{19:7} And he will say, Now my brothers, ye shall not be evil.
{19:8} Behold now, to me two daughters who have not known man'; now I will bring them forth to you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only to these men ye shall not do any thing; for, for this they came in the shadow of my city.
{19:9} And they will say, Stand off. And they will say, This same came to sojourn, and shall he judge judgment: now will we do evil to thee above them: and they will press upon the man, upon Lot greatly, and they will come near to break the door.
{19:10} And the men will stretch out the hand, and will bring in Lot to them to the house, and they shut the door.
{19:11} And the men which were at the door of the house, they struck with blindness, from small to great: and they will be wearied to find the door.
{19:12} And the men will say to Lot, Who to thee here yet? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and all which are to thee in the city, bring forth out of this place.
{19:13} For we destroy this place, for their cry was great at the face of Jehovah; and Jehovah will send us to destroy it.
{19:14} And Lot will go out, and will speak to his sons-in-law, having taken his daughters, and he will say, Rise ye up, go forth out of this place; for Jehovah destroys the city: and he will be as laughing in the eyes of his sons-in-law.
{19:15} And when the dawn arose, the messengers will hasten upon Lot, saying, Rise up, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, being found, lest thou shalt be destroyed in the iniquity of the city.
{19:16} And he shall linger, and the men will hold fast upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; in Jehovah's having compassion upon him; and they shall bring him forth, and lead him without the city.
{19:17} And it shall be when having brought them forth without, he will say, Escape for thy life; thou shalt not look behind thee, and thou shalt not stay in all the circuit: escape to the mountain, lest thou shalt be destroyed.
{19:18} And Lot will say to them, Nay, now, Lord!
{19:19} Behold now, thy servant found grace in thine eyes, and thou wilt magnify thy kindness, what thou didst by me to make my soul live: and I shall not be able to escape to the mountain so evil over-taking me, and I die.
{19:20} Behold now, this city drawing nigh to flee there, and it is small: now I shall be saved there, is it not small? and my soul shall live.
{19:21} And he will say to him, Behold, I lifted up thy face also for thy word, not to overthrow this city for which thou spakest.
{19:22} Hasten, to escape there, for I shall not be able to do the word till thy coming there: for this the name of the city was called Zoar.
{19:23} The sun came forth upon the earth, and Lot came to Zoar.
{19:24} And Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah, sulphur and fire from Jehovah out of the heavens.
{19:25} And he will overturn these cities, and all the circuit, and all inhabiting the cities, and the sprouting of the earth.
{19:26} And his wife will look hack from behind him, and will become a pillar of salt.
{19:27} And Abraham will rise early in the morning to the place in which he stood there by the face of Jehovah.
{19:28} And he will look out upon the face of Sodom and Gomorrah and upon all the face of the earth of the circuit, and he will see, and behold the smoke of the earth ascended as the smoke of a furnace.
{19:29} And it shall be in God's destroying the cities of the circuit, and God will remember Abraham, and he will send forth Lot out of the midst of the overthrow in overthrowing the cities in which Lot dwelt in them.
{19:30} And Lot will go up from Zoar and will dwell in the mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he will fear to dwell in Zoar; and he will dwell in a cave, he and his two daughters.
{19:31} And the first-born will say to the small, our father has become old, and not a man in the earth to come in to us according to the way of all the earth:
{19:32} Come, we will give to our father wine to drink, and we will lie down with him, and we shall preserve alive seed from our father.
{19:33} And they will give their father wine to drink in that night, and the first-born will go in and will lie down with her father; and he will not know in her lying down, and in her rising up.
{19:34} And it shall be on the morrow, and the first-born will say to the small, Behold, I lay down yesterday with my father: we will also give him wine to drink this night; and go thou, lie down with him, and we shall preserve alive seed from our father.
{19:35} And they will give their father wine to drink also in that night, and the small will arise and will he down with him, and he will not know in her lying down and her rising up.
{19:36} And the two daughters of Lot will conceive by their father.
{19:37} And the first-born will bring forth a son, and she will call his name Moab: this the father of Moab till this day.
{19:38} And the small also, she will bring forth a son, and she will call his name the son of my people: this the father of the sons of Ammon till this day.
{20:1} And Abraham will remove from thence to the land of the south, and will dwell between Kadesh and between Shur, and will sojourn in Gerar.
{20:2} And Abraham will say as to Sarah his wife, This my sister: and Abimelech, king of Gerar, will send and take Sarah.
{20:3} And God will come to Abimelech in a dream at night, and say to him, Behold, thou dead, for the woman which thou didst take, and she having married a husband.
{20:4} And Abimelech came not near to her: and he will say, Lord, wilt thou also slay a just nation?
{20:5} Did he not say to me, This my sister? and she also, she said he is my brother: in the uprightness of my heart, and in cleanness of my hands have I done this.
{20:6} And God will say to him in a dream, I knew also that in the uprightness of thy heart thou didst this; and I also will restrain thee from sinning against me: for this I suffered thee not to touch her.
{20:7} And now turn back to the man the woman; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and do thou live: and if thou turn her not back, know that dying, thou shalt die, thou and all which are to thee.
{20:8} And Abimelech will rise early in the morning, and will call to all his servants, and will speak all these words in their ears: and the men shall be greatly afraid.
{20:9} And Abimelech will call to Abraham, and say to him, What didst thou to us? and what did we sin against thee, that thou didst bring upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? thou didst works to me which shall not be done.
{20:10} And Abimelech will say to Abraham, What sawest thou that thou didst this thing?
{20:11} And Abraham will say, For I said, Surely there is not the fear of God in this place; and they will kill me because of my wife.
{20:12} And truly also my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother: and she was to me for wife.
{20:13} And it shall be when God causes me to wander from my father's house, and I said to her, This thy kindness which thou shalt do by me; at every place to which we shall come, there say of me, He is my brother.
{20:14} And Abimelech will take sheep and oxen and servants, and maid-servants, and will give to Abraham, and will return to him Sarah his wife.
{20:15} And Abimelech will say, Behold, my land before thy face: dwell in the good in thine eyes.
{20:16} And to Sarah he said, Behold, I gave a thousand of silver to thy brother; behold, he is to thee for a garment of the eyes to all who are with thee, and with all: and she was set right.
{20:17} And Abraham will pray to God; and God will heal Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants; and they will bring forth.
{20:18} For shutting up, Jehovah shut up without every womb to the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
{21:1} And Jehovah reviewed Sarah as he said; and Jehovah will do to Sarah as he spake.
{21:2} And Sarah shall conceive, and bring forth to Abraham a son to his old age, at the appointed time which God spake to him.
{21:3} And Abraham shall call the name of his son being born to him, whom Sarah will bear to him, Isaak.
{21:4} And Abraham shall circumcise Isaak his son, the son of eight days, as God commanded him.
{21:5} And Abraham the son of an hundred years in the bringing forth to him Isaak his son.
{21:6} And Sarah will say, God made me laugh; all hearing will laugh with me.
{21:7} And she will say, Who spake to Abraham, Sarah suckles sons? for I brought forth a son in his old age.
{21:8} And the child will become great, and shall be weaned; and Abraham will make a great drinking in the day of weaning Isaak.
{21:9} And Sarah will see the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she brought forth to Abraham, laughing.
{21:10} And she will say to Abraham, Cast out this maid-servant and her son; for the son of this maid-servant shall not inherit with my son, with Isaak.
{21:11} And the word was greatly evil in the eyes of Abraham, on account of his son.
{21:12} And God will say to Abraham, It shall not be evil in thine eyes concerning the boy, and concerning thy maidservant; all which Sarah shall say to thee, hear to her voice; for in Isaak the seed shall be called to thee.
{21:13} And also the son of this maid-servant, I will make him into a nation, for he is thy seed.
{21:14} And Abraham will rise early in the morning, and take food, and a leathern bottle of water, and give to Hagar (putting upon her shoulder), and the child, and will send her away: and she will go forth and wander in the desert to the well of the oath.
{21:15} And the waters shall be spent in the water skin, and she will cast the child under one of the shrubs.
{21:16} And she will go and seat herself from over against, being far off as the bending of a bow: for she said, I will not see the death of the child. And she will seat herself from over against, and she will lift up her voice and weep.
{21:17} And God will hear the voice of the child: and the messenger of God will call to Hagar from the heavens, and will say to her, What to thee Hagar? thou shalt not fear, for God heard the voice of the child, from where he is.
{21:18} Arise, lift up the child, and fasten thy hand upon him; for I will make him into a great nation.
{21:19} And God will open her eyes, and she will see a well of waters, and will go and fill the water skin with water, and will give the child to drink.
{21:20} And God will be with the child; and he will be great, and dwell in the desert, and will be to increase the bow.
{21:21} And he will dwell in the desert Paran: and his mother will take to him a wife from the land of Egypt.
{21:22} And it shall be in that tune, and Abimelech will speak, and Phicol, leader of his army, to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest.
{21:23} And now swear to me in God, whether if thou shalt lie to me and to my progeny, and to my progenies; according to the kindness which I did to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land in which thou didst sojourn in it.
{21:24} And Abraham will say, I will swear.
{21:25} And Abraham rebuked Abimelech on account of the well of waters which Abimelech's servants took away by force.
{21:26} And Abimelech will say, I knew not who did this thing; and also thou didst not announce to me, and also I heard not except this day.
{21:27} And Abraham will take sheep and oxen, and give to Abimelech; and they two made a covenant.
{21:28} And Abraham set, seven ewe lambs of the sheep alone.
{21:29} And Abimelech will say to Abraham, What here these seven ewe lambs which thou didst set alone?
{21:30} And he will say, For the seven ewe lambs thou shalt take from my hand, in order to be to me for a testimony that I dug this well.
{21:31} For this he called that place, The well of the oath, for there they two aware.
{21:32} And they will make a covenant, at the well of the oath, and Abimelech will rise up, and Phicol, the leader of his army, and they will turn back to the land of the Philistines,
{21:33} And be will plant the tamarisk by the well of the oath, and will call there upon the name of Jehovah, the eternal God.
{21:34} And Abraham will sojourn in the land of the Philistines many days.
{22:1} And it shall be after these words, and God tried Abraham, and he will say to him, Abraham: and he will say, Behold, here I.
{22:2} And he will say, Take now thy son, thine only, whom thou didst love, Isaak, and go by thyself to the land of Moriah; and carry him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains of which I told thee.
{22:3} And Abraham will rise early in the morning, and will saddle his ass, and will take two of his boys with him, and Isaak his son, and he will cleave the wood for the burnt offering, and will rise up and go to the place God spake to him.
{22:4} In the third day, Abraham will lift up his eyes and will see the place from far.
{22:5} And Abraham will say to his boys, Sit ye here in this place with the ass; I and the boy will go even there and worship, and will turn back to you.
{22:6} And Abraham will take the wood of the burnt offering, and put upon Isaak his son; and will take in his hand the fire and the knife, and they will go, they two together.
{22:7} And Isaak will say to Abraham his father, and he will say, My father: and he will say, Behold, me, my son: And he will say, Behold the fire and the wood, and where the sheep for a burnt offering?
{22:8} And Abraham will say, God will see to himself the sheep for a burnt-offering my son: and they will go, they two together.
{22:9} And they will come to the place which God said to him; and Abraham will build an altar there, and put in order the wood: and he will find Isaak his son, and put him upon the altar, upon the wood.
{22:10} And Abraham will stretch out the hand and will take the knife to slaughter his son.
{22:11} And the messenger of Jehovah will call to him out of the heavens, and will say, Abraham, Abraham. And he will say, Behold me.
{22:12} And he will say, Thou shalt not put forth thy hand upon the boy, and thou shalt do nothing to him; for now I know that thou fearest God, and thou didst not spare thy son thine only, from me.
{22:13} And Abraham will lift up his eyes, and will see and behold a ram behind, being held in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham will come and take the ram and bring it for a burnt offering instead of his son.
{22:14} And Abraham will call the name of that place, Jehovah will see: which shall be said to this day, Jehovah will see in the mountain.
{22:15} And the messenger of Jehovah will call to Abraham the second time out of the heavens.
{22:16} And he will say, By myself did I swear, says Jehovah, for because that thou didst this word, and didst not spare thy son, thine only.
{22:17} That praising, I will praise thee, and multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand upon the lip of the sea; and thy seed shall inherit the gate of his enemies.
{22:18} And in thy seed all the nations of the earth shall be praised; because that thou didst listen to my voice.
{22:19} And Abraham will turn back to his boys, and they will rise up, and go together to the well of the oath; and Abraham will dwell at the well of the oath.
{22:20} And it shall be after these words, it will be announced to Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also will bring forth sons to Nahor, thy brother.
{22:21} Uz, his first-born, and Buz, his brother, and Lemuel, the father of Aram.
{22:22} And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
{22:23} And Bethuel will beget Rebekah: these eight, Milcah will bring forth to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
{22:24} And his concubine, and her name Reumah, and she will bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachab.
{23:1} And the life of Sarah shall be a hundred years, and twenty years, and seven years; the years of the life of Sarah.
{23:2} And Sarah shall die in the city of four; this is Hebron, in the land of Canaan. And Abraham will come to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
{23:3} And Abraham will rise up from the face of his dead, and speak to the sons of Heth, saying,
{23:4} I am a sojourner and stranger with you: give me the possession of a grave with you, and I will bury my dead from my face.
{23:5} And the sons of Heth will answer Abraham, saying to him,
{23:6} Hear us, lord; thou a prince of God in the midst of us: in the choice of our graves, bury thy dead; a man of us shall not withhold from thee his grave from burying thy dead.
{23:7} And Abraham will rise up and will bow himself to the earth before the sons of Heth.
{23:8} And he will speak to them, saying, If it is your soul to bury my dead from my face, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron, son of Zohar.
{23:9} And he shall give to me the cave of Machpelah, which is to him, which is in the end of his field; for the full silver he shall give it to me in the midst of you for the possession of a grave.
{23:10} And Ephron dwelt in the midst of the sons of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite will answer Abraham in the ears of the sons of Heth, of all going to the gate of his city, saying,
{23:11} Nay, lord, hear me; the field I gave thee, and the cave which is in it, to thee I gave it before the eyes of the sons of my people; I gave to thee: bury thy dead.
{23:12} And Abraham will bow himself down before the face of the people of the land.
{23:13} And he will speak to Ephron in the ears of the people of the land, saying, Surely, if thou art for it, hear me: I gave silver for the field, take of me: and I will bury my dead there.
{23:14} And Ephron will answer Abraham, saying to him,
{23:15} Lord, hear me: the land, four hundred shekels of silver; between me and between thee, what is that? and bury thy dead.
{23:16} And Abraham will listen to Ephron, and Abraham will weigh to Ephron the silver, which he spake in the ears of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, passing for traffic.
{23:17} And Ephron's field will stand, which is in Machpelah, which is before the face of Mamra, the field and cave which are in it, and every tree which is in the field, which is in all the bounds round about.
{23:18} To Abraham for a possession before the eyes of the sons of Heth, with all going to the gate of his city.
{23:19} And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before the face of Mamra: this is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
{23:20} And the field will stand, and the cave which is in it, to Abraham for the possession of a burying place, from the sons of Heth.
{24:1} And Abraham was old and come days: and Jehovah praised Abraham in every thing.
{24:2} And Abraham will say to the old man of his house ruling over all which is to him, Put now thy hand under my thigh.
{24:3} And I will cause thee to swear by Jehovah, God of the heavens, and God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife to my son, from the daughters of the Canaanites in the midst of whom I shall dwell.
{24:4} For thou shalt go to my land and to my native country, and take a wife to my son, to Isaak.
{24:5} And the servant will say to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to come after me to this land: shall I turning back, turn back your son to the land from whence thou camest?
{24:6} And Abraham will say to him, Observe to thyself that thou shalt not turn back ray son there.
{24:7} Jehovah, God of the heavens, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my birth, and who spake to me, and who sware to me, saying, To thy seed will I give this land: he will send his messenger before thy face, and thou shalt take a wife to my son from thence.
{24:8} And if the woman shall not be willing to come after thee, and thou shalt be clear from this thine oath; only thou shalt not turn back my son there.
{24:9} And the servant will put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his lord, and swear to him concerning this word.
{24:10} And the servant shall take ten camels from the camels of his lord, and will go, and all the goods of his lord in his hand; and he will rise and go to Syria of the rivers to the city of Nahor.
{24:11} And he will make his camels to kneel down without the city by the well of waters, at the time of evening, of the going forth to draw water.
{24:12} And he will say, Jehovah, God of lord Abraham, light upon my face this day, and do kindness with lord Abraham.
{24:13} Behold, I stand at the fountain of waters, and the daughters of the men of the city come forth to draw water.
{24:14} And it shall be the girl to whom saying to her, incline now thy bucket, and I will drink; and she said, Drink, and I will also give thy camels to drink; thou didst appoint for thy servant Isaak; and by it I shall know that thou didst kindness with my lord.
{24:15} And it shall be before he finished speaking, and behold Rebekah came forth, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, and her bucket upon her shoulder.
{24:16} And the girl good of aspect exceedingly; a virgin, and man knew her not: and she will go down to the fountain and fill her bucket, and come up.
{24:17} And the servant will run to meet her, and he will say, Give me to drink now a little water from thy bucket.
{24:18} And she will say, Drink, lord: and she will hasten, and she will bring down her bucket upon her hand, and will give him to drink.
{24:19} And she will finish to give him to drink, and will say, I will draw also for thy camels; till they finished drinking.
{24:20} And she will hasten and empty her bucket into the watering trough, and will run again to the well to draw, and will draw for all his camels.
{24:21} And the man looking with attention at her, being silent to know whether Jehovah prospered his way or not.
{24:22} And it shall be when the camels finished drinking, and the man will take a gold ring of half a shekel, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels of gold.
{24:23} And he will say, Whose daughter thou? announce now to me: is there place in thy father's house for us to pass the night?
{24:24} And she will say to him, I the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, who was born to Nahor.
{24:25} And she will say to him, also straw, and also much fodder to us; also a place to pass the night.
{24:26} And the man will bow down and prostrate himself to Jehovah.
{24:27} And he will say, Praised be Jehovah, God of lord Abraham, who let not go his kindness and his truth from my lord: I in the way, Jehovah led me to the house of my lord's brother.
{24:28} And the girl will run and announce to the house of her mother, according to these words.
{24:29} And to Rebekah a brother, and his name Laban: and Laban will run to the man without at the fountain.
{24:30} And it will be after seeing the ring and the bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when hearing the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus the man spake to me; and he will come to the man, and behold, he stood by the camels at the fountain.
{24:31} And he will say, Come thou blessed of Jehovah, why wilt thou stand without? and I prepared the house, and a place for the camels.
{24:32} And the man will come into the house and will loosen the camels, and give straw and fodder to the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men which are with him.
{24:33} And he will set before his face to eat, and he will say, Not to eat till I have spoken my word. And he will say, Speak.
{24:34} And he will say, I am Abraham's servant.
{24:35} And Jehovah blessed my lord greatly, and he will be great; and he will give to him sheep and oxen, and silver and gold, and servants and maids and camels and asses.
{24:36} And Sarah my lord's wife will bring forth a son to my lord after she was old, and to him he will give all which is to him.
{24:37} And my lord will cause me to swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I dwell.
{24:38} If not, thou shalt go to my father's house, and to my family, and take a wife to my son.
{24:39} And saying to my lord, If the woman will not come after me?
{24:40} And he will say to me, Jehovah, before whose face I walked, will send his messenger with thee, and prosper thy way, and thou shalt take a wife to my son from my family, and from my father's house.
{24:41} Then shalt thou be clean from mine oath, when thou shalt come to my family; if they will not give to thee, and thou shalt be pure from mine oath.
{24:42} And I will come this day to the fountain, and say, Jehovah, God of lord Abraham, if thou wilt now incline thyself to prosper my way in which I go:
{24:43} Behold, I stand by the fountain of waters, and the virgin coming forth to draw, and I said to her, Now give me to drink a little water from thy bucket.
{24:44} And she saying to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: she the woman which Jehovah appointed for my lord's son.
{24:45} Before I shall finish speaking to my heart, and behold, Rebekah went forth, and her bucket upon her shoulder; and she will go down to the fountain and draw; and saying to her, Give me to drink now.
{24:46} And she will hasten and will bring down her bucket from her, and will say, Drink, and I will water thy camels also: and I shall drink, and she watered the camels also.
{24:47} And I shall ask her and say, Whose daughter thou? And she will say, The daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah brought forth to him: and I shall place the ring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
{24:48} And I shall bow down and worship Jehovah, and bless Jehovah, God of lord Abraham, who led me in the way of truth to take the daughter of my lord's brother to his son.
{24:49} And now if ye are doing kindness and truth with my lord, announce to me, and if not, announce to me; and I shall turn to the right hand or to the left.
{24:50} And Laban will answer, and Bethuel, and they will say, This word came from Jehovah; we shall not be able to speak to thee, evil or good.
{24:51} Behold, Rebekah before thy face, take and go, and she shall be wife to thy lord's son, according to what Jehovah spake.
{24:52} And it shall be when Abraham's servant heard their words, and he will worship Jehovah to the earth.
{24:53} And the servant will bring forth silver vessels, and gold vessels, and garments, and he will give to Rebekah; and giving precious things to her brother and to her mother.
{24:54} And they will eat and drink, he and the men which were with him; and they will pass the night; and they will rise up in the morning, and he will say, Send me forth to my lord.
{24:55} And her brother will say, and her mother, The girl shall remain with us, perhaps ten days; after that she shall go.
{24:56} And he will say to them, Ye shall not delay me, and Jehovah prospered my way send me forth, and I shall go to my lord.
{24:57} And they will say, We will, call to the girl, and ask her mouth.
{24:58} And they will call to Rebekah, and will say to her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she will say, I will go.
{24:59} And they will send forth Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
{24:60} And they will bless Rebekah and will say to her, Thou our sister; be thou into thousands of ten thousands, and thy seed shall inherit the gate of his enemies.
{24:61} And Rebekah will rise up, and her maidens, and ride upon the camels, and will go after the man: and the servant will take Rebekah and will go.
{24:62} And Isaak came from going to the well to the living vision, and he dwelt in the south land.
{24:63} And Isaak will go forth to investigate in the field at the face of evening: and will lift up his eyes, and will see, and behold, the camels coming.
{24:64} And Rebekah will lift up her eyes, and see Isaak; and she will descend from the camel.
{24:65} And she will say to the servant, Who this man going in the field to meet us? And the servant will say, He is my lord: and she will take a covering and cover herself.
{24:66} And the servant will recount to Isaak all the words which he did.
{24:67} And Isaak will come into Sarah's his mother's tent, and will take Rebekah and she will be to him for a wife; and he will love her: and Isaak will be comforted after that for his mother.
{25:1} And Abraham will add and take a wife; and her name Keturah.
{25:2} And she will bring forth to him, Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.

{25:4} And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these the sons of Keturah.
{25:5} And Abraham will give all which is to him to Isaak.
{25:6} And to the sons of the concubines which were to Abraham, Abraham gave gifts, and he will send them away from Isaak his son (in his yet living) from the east to the east land.
{25:7} And these the days of the years of the life of Abraham which he lived, a hundred years and seventy years and five years.
{25:8} And Abraham shall expire, and shall die in a good old age, and being filled; and he shall be added to his people.
{25:9} And his sons Isaak and Ishmael will bury him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, son of Zohar the Hittite, which is at the face of Mamm;
{25:10} The field which Abraham bought from the sons of Heth: there Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife.
{25:11} And it shall be after the death of Abraham, God will bless Isaak his son; and Isaak will dwell by the well at the living vision.
{25:12} These the generations of Ishmael, son of Abraham, whom Hagar brought forth, the Egyptian, Sarah's maid, to Abraham.
{25:13} And the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names according their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth, and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
{25:14} And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

{25:16} These the sons of Ishmael, and these their names, in their villages, and in their fortresses; twelve princes, according to their nation.
{25:17} And these the years of the life of Ishmael: a hundred years, and thirty years and seven years: and he will expire and die; and he will be added to his People.
{25:18} And they will dwell from Havilah, even to Shur, which is upon the face of Egypt, in thy going to Assyria: and he fell before the face of all his brethren.
{25:19} And these the generations of Isaak, son of Abraham: Abraham begetting Isaak.
{25:20} And Isaak shall be the son of forty years in his taking Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan Aram, sister of Laban the Syrian, to him for a wife.
{25:21} And Isaak will supplicate to Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren: and Jehovah will be supplicated for him, and Rebekah his wife will conceive.
{25:22} And the sons will struggle within her: and she will say. If so, wherefore am I thus? And she will go to inquire of Jehovah.
{25:23} And Jehovah will say to her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be separated from thy belly: and a people shall be strong above a people, and the great shall serve the small.
{25:24} And her days shall be completed to bring forth; and behold, twins in her belly.
{25:25} And the first shall come forth red, wholly as a mantle of hair: and they will call his name Esau.
{25:26} And after this, his brother will come forth, and his hand having laid hold upon Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaak the son of sixty years in her bringing them forth.
{25:27} And the boys will become great; and Esau will be a man knowing the chase, a man of the country; and Jacob an upright man, dwelling in tents.
{25:28} And Isaak will love Esau for the chase in his mouth: and Rebekah loved Jacob.
{25:29} And Jacob will boil a boiling, and Esau will come from the country, and he faint.
{25:30} And Esau will say to Jacob, Give me now to eat from the red; this red, for I faint: for this he called his name Edom.
{25:31} And Jacob will say, Sell this day thy birth-right to me.
{25:32} And Esau will say, Behold, I am going to die, and what to me this birthright?
{25:33} And Jacob will say, Swear to me this day: and he will swear to him: and he will sell his birth-right to Jacob.
{25:34} And Jacob gave Esau food, and the boiling of lentiles; and he will eat and drink and will rise and go forth: and Esau will despise the birth-right.
{26:1} And a famine shall be in the land, besides the first famine which was in the days of Abraham. And Isaak will go to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.
{26:2} And Jehovah will be seen to him, and will say, Thou shalt not go down to Egypt: dwell in the land which I shall say to thee.
{26:3} Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee, for to thee and to thy seed will I give all these lands; and I established the oath which I sware to Abraham thy father.
{26:4} And I will increase thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and I will give to thy seed all these lands: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be praised.
{26:5} Because that Abraham listened to my voice, and he will watch my watches, my commands, my statutes, and my precepts.
{26:6} And Isaak dwelt in Gerar.
{26:7} And the men of the place will ask concerning his wife; and he will say, She is my sister: for he will be afraid to say, My wife, lest the men of the place will kill me for Rebekah, because she is good in appearance.
{26:8} And it was when the days there were long to him, and Abimelech king of the Philistines shall bend forward through the window, and will see, and behold, Isaak playing with Rebekah his wife.
{26:9} And Abimelech will call to Isaak, and will say, Surely, behold, she thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaak will say to him, Because I said, Lest I shall die for her.
{26:10} And Abimelech will say, What this thou didst to us? nearly one of the people lay with thy wife, and thou broughtest blame upon us.
{26:11} And Abimelech will command all the people, saying, He touching this man and his wife, dying, shall die.
{26:12} And Isaak will sow in that land, and will find in that year a hundred measures; and Jehovah will praise him.
{26:13} And the man will become great, and went going, and he became great, until that he became very great.
{26:14} And there will be to him possession of flocks, and possession of oxen, and service of many; and the Philistines will envy him.
{26:15} And all the wells which his father's servants digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped them and filled them with dust.
{26:16} And Abimelech will say to Isaak, Go from us: for thou wert strong above us exceedingly.
{26:17} And Isaak will go from thence, and will sit down in the valley of Gerar, and will dwell there.
{26:18} And Isaak will dwell, and he will dig the wells of waters which they digged in the days of Abraham his father; and the Philistines will stop them after Abraham died: and he will call them the names after the names which his father called them.
{26:19} And Isaak's servants will dig in the valley and will find there a well of waters.
{26:20} And the shepherds of Gerar will contend with Isaak's shepherds, saying; The waters are to us: and he will call the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
{26:21} And they will dig another well, and will strive for that also: and he will call its name Sitnah.
{26:22} And he will remove from thence, and will dig another well; and they strove not for that: and he will call its name Rehoboth; and he will say, For now Jehovah made wide for us, and made us fruitful in the earth.
{26:23} And he will go up from thence to the well of the oath.
{26:24} And Jehovah will be seen to him in that night, and will say, I am the God of Abraham thy father: thou shalt not be afraid, for I am with thee, and I praised thee, and I increased thy seed, for sake of Abraham my servant.
{26:25} And he will build an altar there, and will call on the name of Jehovah, and will stretch out there his tent: and there Isaak's servants will dig a well.
{26:26} And Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol, leader of his army.
{26:27} And Isaak will say to them, Wherefore came ye to me, and ye hated me, and will send me away from you?
{26:28} And they will say, Seeing we saw that Jehovah was with thee: and we will say, There shall be an oath between us, between us and between thee, and we will make a covenant with thee.
{26:29} Wilt thou do evil to us as that we touched thee not, as that we did to thee only good, and we sent thee away in peace, thou now art praised of Jehovah.
{26:30} And he will make to them a drinking, and they will eat and drink.
{26:31} And they will rise early in the morning, and they will swear, a man to his brother, and Isaak will send them away and they will go from him in peace.
{26:32} And it shall be in that day, and Isaak's servants will come and announce to him concerning the well which they digged, and they will say to him, We found water.
{26:33} And he will call it oath: for this the name of the city the well of the oath till this day.
{26:34} And Esau will be the son of forty years, and he will take a wife, Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemah, daughter of Elon the Hittite.
{26:35} And they will be bitterness of spirit to Isaak and to Rebekah.
{27:1} And it shall be as Isaak grew old, and his eyes shall be weak for seeing, and he will call Esau his son the great, and he will say to him, My son: and he will say to him, Behold me.
{27:2} And he will say, Behold now, I grew old; I knew not the day of my death.
{27:3} Therefore take now, thy weapon, thy quiver and thy bow, and go forth to the field and hunt for me a hunting.
{27:4} And make for me dainties as that I loved, and bring it to me, and eating, that my soul shall praise thee before I shall die.
{27:5} And Rebekah heard in the speaking of Isaak to Esau his son: and Esau went to the field to hunt, a hunting, to bring.
{27:6} And Rebekah spake to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speaking to Esau thy brother, saying,
{27:7} Bring to me a hunting, and make for me dainties, and eating, and I will praise thee before Jehovah, before my death.
{27:8} And now my son, hear to my voice, according to that I command thee.
{27:9} Go now to the flocks, and take to me from thence two kids of the she-goats good, and I will make them dainties for thy father, as that he loved.
{27:10} And thou shall bring to thy father, and eating, so that he will praise thee before his death.
{27:11} And Jacob will say to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother a man of hair, and I a smooth man:
{27:12} Perhaps my father will feel me, and I was in his eyes as mocking; and I brought a curse and not a praise.
{27:13} And his mother will say to him, Upon me thy curse my son; only hear to my voice, and go take to me.
{27:14} And he will go, and will take, and bring to his mother: and his mother will make dainties as that his father loved.
{27:15} And Rebekah will take desirable covering of Esau her son, the great, which was with her in the house, and will put upon Jacob her son, the small.
{27:16} And the nakedness of the skins of the shegoats, she put upon his hands and upon the smoothness of his neck.
{27:17} And she will give the dainties, and the bread which she made, into the hand of Jacob her son.
{27:18} And he will go to his father and will say, My father. And he will say, Behold me; who thou my son?
{27:19} And Jacob will say to his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I did according to that thou spakest to me: arise, now, sit and eat from my hunting, so that thy soul shall praise me.
{27:20} And Isaak will say to his son, How this, thou wert quick to find my son? and the will say, Because Jehovah thy God caused to meet before me.
{27:21} And Isaak will say to Jacob, Come near, now, and I shall feel thee, my son, if thou this my son Esau or not.
{27:22} And Jacob will come near to Isaak his father, and he will feel him, and he will say, The voice, the voice of Jacob; and the hands, the hands of Esau.
{27:23} And he knew him not, for his hands were as the hands of Esau, his brother of hair: and he will praise him.
{27:24} And he will say, Thou this my son Esau? and he will say, I.
{27:25} And he will say, Bring near to me, and eating of my son's hunting, so that my soul shall praise thee. And he will bring near to him and he will eat: and he will bring wine to him, and he will drink.
{27:26} And Isaak his father will say to him, Come near, now, and kiss me, my son.
{27:27} And he will come near, and will kiss him: and he will smell the smell of his garment, and he will bless him, and he will say, See, the smell of my son as the smell of a field which Jehovah praised.
{27:28} And God will give to thee from the dew of the heavens, and from the fatness of the earth, and a multitude of corn and new wine.
{27:29} And nations shall serve thee, and peoples shall bow down to thee; be lord over thy brother, and thy mother's sons shall bow down to thee: cursed he cursing thee, and blessed he praising thee.
{27:30} And it shall be after that Isaak finished to praise Jacob, and it shall be Jacob going will but go out from the face of Isaak his father, and Esau his brother came from his hunting.
{27:31} And he also will make dainties, and will bring to his father; and he will say to his father, Will my father rise and eat from his son's hunting, that thy soul shall bless me?
{27:32} And Isaak his father will say to him, Who art thou? And he will say, I thy son, thy first-born, Esau.
{27:33} And Isaak will tremble a great trembling, even exceedingly; and he will say, Who now is he having hunted a hunting, and will bring to me, and I ate from all before thou wilt come, and I shall praise him? also he shall be praised.
{27:34} When Esau heard the words of his father, and he will cry out with a great cry, even bitter exceedingly, and he will say to his father, praise me, me also, my father!
{27:35} And he will say, Thy brother came with deceit and he will take thy blessing.
{27:36} And he will say, Is it not that his name was called Jacob? he will defraud me this twice: he took my birthright and behold, now he took my blessing And he will say, Didst thou not put aside a blessing for me?
{27:37} And Isaak will answer and say to Esau, Behold, I made him mighty over thee, and all his brethren I gave to him for servants; and with corn and new wine I supported him: and what shall I do to thee my son?
{27:38} And Esau will say to his father, Is but this one blessing to thee my father? bless me, also me, my father! and Esau will lift up the voice and weep.
{27:39} And Isaak his father will answer and say to him, Behold, from the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling, and from the dew of the heavens above.
{27:40} And by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother: and it shall be when thou shalt wander about and thou shalt break his yoke from thy neck.
{27:41} And Esau will lie in wait for Jacob, because of the blessing which his father blessed him: and Esau will say in his heart, The days of mourning of my father will draw near, and I will kill Jacob my brother.
{27:42} And the words of Esau her son, the great, will be announced to Rebekah; and she will send and call to Jacob her son, the small, and she will say to him, Behold, Esau thy brother will avenge himself toward thee by killing thee.
{27:43} And now my son, hear to my voice: and arising escape for thyself to Laban my brother, to Haran.
{27:44} And thou shalt dwell with him days afterwards, until thy brother's wrath shall turn away;
{27:45} Until thy brother's anger turning away from thee, and forgetting what thou didst to him: and I have sent and have taken thee from thence, lest I shall be bereaved of you two in one day.
{27:46} And Rebekah will say to Isaak, I was finished in my life from the face of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob took a wife from the daughters of Heth, as these from the daughters of the land, for what to me life?
{28:1} And Isaak will call to Jacob, and will bless him, and will command him, and will say to him, Thou shalt not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.
{28:2} Rising, go to Padan Aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father, and take to thee from thence a wife from the daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother.
{28:3} And God Almighty will bless thee, and will make thee fruitful, and will multiply thee, and thou wert for an assembly of nations.
{28:4} And he will give to thee the praise of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; for thee to inherit the land of thy sojourning, which God gave to Abraham.
{28:5} And Isaak will send away Jacob; and he will go to Padan Aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian, brother of Rebekah, mother of Jacob and Esau.
{28:6} And Esau will see that Isaak praised Jacob, and sent him away to Padan Aram, to take to him from thence a wife; in blessing him, and he will command him saying, Thou shalt not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan;
{28:7} And Jacob will hear to his father, and to his mother, and will go to Padan Aram.
{28:8} And Esau will see that the daughters of Canaan are evil in the eyes of Isaak his father.
{28:9} And Esau will go to Ishmael, and will take Mahalath, daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, sister of Nebajoth, to his wives, to him for a wife.
{28:10} And Jacob will go from the well of the oath, and will come to Haran.
{28:11} And he will light upon a place and he will remain there, for the sun was gone down: and he will take from the stones of the place and put at his head and will lie down in that place.
{28:12} And he will dream, and behold a ladder placed in the earth, and the head of it reaching to the heavens: and behold the messengers of God ascending and descending upon it.
{28:13} And behold, Jehovah was set upon it, and he will say, I Jehovah, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaak: the land which thou liest upon it, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.
{28:14} And thy seed was as the dust of the earth, And thou didst spread abroad to the sea and east, and north, and south: and in thee shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed, and in thy seed.
{28:15} And behold, I am with thee, and I preserved thee in all which thou shalt go, and I turned thee back to this land; for I will not forsake thee, till that I have done what I said to thee.
{28:16} And Jacob will awake from his sleep, and he will say, surely there is Jehovah in this place and I knew not.
{28:17} And he will be afraid, and will Say, How terrible this place is not this but the house of God, and this the gate of the heavens?
{28:18} And Jacob will rise early in the morning, and take the stone which he put at his head, and will set it a pillar, and pour oil upon its head.
{28:19} And he will call the name of that place the house of God: and Ailam Luz the name of the city at the beginning.
{28:20} And Jacob will vow a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will preserve me in this way which I went, and gave to me bread to eat, and covering to put on,
{28:21} And I turned back in peace to my father's house; and Jehovah was to me for God.
{28:22} And this stone which I set a pillar shall be the house of God, and all which thou shalt give to me, the tenth I will tithe it to thee.
{29:1} And Jacob will lift up his feet and will go to the land of the sons of the east.
{29:2} And he will see, and behold, a well in the field, and behold there three flocks of sheep lying by it; for from that well they will water the flocks and the great stone upon the mouth of the well.
{29:3} And they gather there all the flocks; and they rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well and watered the sheep, and turned back the stone upon the mouth of the well to its place.
{29:4} And Jacob will say to them, My brethren, whence are ye? and they will say, We are from Haran.
{29:5} And he will say to them, knew ye Laban the son of Nahor? and they will say, We knew.
{29:6} And he will say to them, Is health to him? and they will say, Health: Behold, Rachel his daughter came with the sheep.
{29:7} And he will say, Behold, yet the day great, not the time of gathering the cattle; water ye the sheep, and go feed.
{29:8} And they will say, We shall not be able, till that all the flocks shall be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; and we water the sheep.
{29:9} He yet speaking to them, and Rachel came with the sheep were to her father; for she fed them.
{29:10} And it shall be when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, and Jacob will come near, and will roll away the stone from the mouth of the well, and will water the sheep of Laban his mother's brother.
{29:11} And Jacob will kiss Rachel, and will lift up his voice and weep.
{29:12} And Jacob will announce to Rachel that he is her father's brother, and that he is Rebekah's son; and she will run and announce to her father.
{29:13} And it shall be when Laban heard the hearing of Jacob his sister's son, and he will run to meet him, and he will embrace him, and kiss him and bring him to his house, and he will recount to Laban all these words.
{29:14} And Laban will say to him, Surely my bone and my flesh art thou: and he will dwell with him a month of days.
{29:15} And Laban will say to Jacob, Because thou art my brother shalt thou serve me gratuitously? announce to me what thy reward.
{29:16} And to Laban two daughters: the name to the great, Leah; and the name to the small, Rachel.
{29:17} And the eyes of Leah weak, and Rachel was fair of form and fair of look.
{29:18} And Jacob will love Rachel, and will say, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy daughter the small.
{29:19} And Laban will say, Good for me to give her to thee rather than for me to give her to another man. Dwell with me.
{29:20} And Jacob will serve for Rachel seven years, and they will be in his eyes as a few days in his loving her.
{29:21} And Jacob will say to Laban, Give my wife, for the days were completed, and I will go in to her.
{29:22} And Laban will gather together all the men of the place, and will make a drinking.
{29:23} And it will be in the evening, and he will take Leah his daughter, and bring her to him, and he will go in to her.
{29:24} And Laban will give to her, Zilpah his maid, to Leah his daughter a maid.
{29:25} And it will be in the morning, and behold, she was Leak And he will say to Laban, What this thou didst to me? did I not serve with thee for Rachel? and wherefore didst thou deceive me?
{29:26} And Laban will say, It shall not be done so in our place, to give the small before the first-born.
{29:27} Complete her seven, and we will give to thee also this for work which thou shalt work with me yet other seven years.
{29:28} And Jacob will do so, and he will complete her seven, and he will give to him Rachel his daughter to him for a wife.
{29:29} And Laban will give to Rachel his daughter, Bilhah his maid to her for a maid.
{29:30} And he will go in also to Rachel, and he will also love Rachel more than Leah, and he will serve with him yet other seven years.
{29:31} And Jehovah will see that Leah was hated, and he will open her womb: and Rachel barren.
{29:32} And Leah will conceive and will bring forth a son, and she will call his name Reuben: for she said that Jehovah saw my affliction, for now my husband will love me.
{29:33} And she will yet again conceive and bear a son, and she will say that Jehovah heard that I am hated, and he will give to me this also; and she will call his name Simeon.
{29:34} And she will conceive yet again, and will bear a son, and she will say, The time now, my husband will join himself to me, for I bare to him three sons: for this his name was called Levi.
{29:35} And she will conceive yet again and will bear a son, and she will say, This time I will confess to Jehovah: for this she called his name Judah; and she will stand from bearing.
{30:1} And Rachel will see that she shall not bring forth to Jacob, and Rachel will envy her sister, and will say to Jacob, Give me sons, and if not, I die.
{30:2} And Jacob's anger will burn at Rachel, and he will say, Am I instead of God, who kept back from thee the fruit of the belly?
{30:3} And she will say, Behold my maid Bilhah; go in to her, and she shall bring forth upon my knees, and I also shall be built from her.
{30:4} And she will give to him Bilhah her maid for a wife, and Jacob will go in to her.
{30:5} And Bilhah will conceive and will bear to Jacob a son.
{30:6} And Rachel will say, God judged me and also heard my voice, and he will give to me a son; for this she called his name Dan.
{30:7} And Bilhah, Rachel's maid will yet again conceive and bare a second son to Jacob.
{30:8} And Rachel will say, The wrestlings of God I wrestled with my sister; also I was able. And she will call his name Naphtali.
{30:9} And Leah will see that she stood from bringing forth, and she will take Zilpah her maid and will give her to Jacob for a wife.
{30:10} And Zilpah, Leah's maid, will bear to Jacob a son.
{30:11} And Leah will say, In good fortune: and she will call his name Gad.
{30:12} And Zilpah, Leah's maid, will bear a second son to Jacob.
{30:13} And Leah will say, In my happiness, for the daughters will pronounce me happy; and she will call his name Asher.
{30:14} And Reuben will go in the day of the harvest of wheat, and will find apples of mandrakes in the field, and he will bring them to Leah his mother: and Rachel will say to Leah, Give now to me of thy son's apples of mandrakes.
{30:15} And she will say to her, Is it little, thy taking my husband'! and thou didst take also my son's apples of mandrakes? And Rachel will say, For this he shall lie with thee this night, for thy son's apples of mandrakes.
{30:16} And Jacob will come from the field in the evening, and Leah will go forth to his meeting, and she will say, Thou shalt come in to me, for hiring I hired thee for my son's apples of mandrakes: and he will lie with her in that night.
{30:17} And God will listen to Leah, and she will conceive and bear to Jacob the fifth son.
{30:18} And Leah will say, God gave me My hire because I gave my maid to my husband: and she will call his name Issachar.
{30:19} And Leah will conceive yet again, and will bear the sixth son to Jacob.
{30:20} And Leah will say, God gave me a good gift; this time will my husband dwell with me, for I have borne to him six sons. And she will call his name Zebulon.
{30:21} And afterwards she bare a daughter, and she will call her name Dinah.
{30:22} And God will remember Rachel, and God will listen to her, and he will open her womb.
{30:23} And she will conceive and will bare a son, and she will say, God took away my reproach.
{30:24} And she will call his name Joseph, saying, God will add to me another son.
{30:25} And it shall be when Rachel bare Joseph, and Jacob will say to Laban, send me away, and I shall go to my place and to my land.
{30:26} Give my wives and my children, for whom I served thee, and I will go forth; for thou knewest ray work which I served thee.
{30:27} And Laban will say to him, If now I found grace in thine eyes, I prognosticated, and Jehovah will praise me because of thee.
{30:28} And he will say, Specify thy hire to me, and I will give.
{30:29} And he will say to him, Thou knewest what I served thee, and what was thy cattle with me.
{30:30} For little which was to thee before me, and it will break forth into a multitude; and Jehovah will praise thee at my foot: and now when shall I make to myself a house?
{30:31} And he will say, What shall I give to thee? and Jacob will say, Thou shalt not give to me anything. If thou wilt do to me this word, I will return; I will feed thy sheep; I will watch.
{30:32} I will pass over among all thy sheep this day, removing from thence every sheep speckled and patched, and every sheep black among the lambs; and the patched and speckled among the she-goats; and it shall be my hire.
{30:33} And my justice shall speak for me in the day tomorrow, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one which is not speckled and patched among the she-goats and black among the lambs, that to be stolen with me.
{30:34} And Laban will say to him, Behold, it shall be according to thy word.
{30:35} And he will remove in that day the he-goats banded and patched, and all the she-goats speckled and patched; every one which being white on it, and every one black among the sheep, and he will give into the hand of his sons.
{30:36} And he will set a way of three days between him and between Jacob; and Jacob fed Laban's sheep the rest.
{30:37} And Jacob will take to himself a rod of green storax, and the almond tree, and the plane tree, and he will strip off of them the white strippings, uncovering the white which was upon the rods.
{30:38} And he set the rods which he stripped, in the flowings of channels of water, when the flock shall come to drink, before the sheep, and they shall be in heat in coming to drink.
{30:39} And the sheep shall conceive at the rods, and shall bring forth sheep banded and speckled and patched.
{30:40} And Jacob separated the lambs, and he will give the faces of the sheep to the banded and every one black among the sheep of Laban: and he will set to himself the flocks, to himself alone, and not put them with Laban's sheep.
{30:41} And it was in every one conceiving of the strong sheep, and Jacob put the rods before the eyes of the sheep in the floorings, to conceive among the rods.
{30:42} And in the sheep being feeble, he will not put in: and those being feeble, were to Laban, and those being strong, to Jacob.
{30:43} And the man will break forth greatly, greatly; and there will be to him many sheep and maids, and servants, and camels and asses.
{31:1} And he will hear the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob took all which was to our father, and from what was to our father he made all this multitude.
{31:2} And Jacob will see the face of Laban, and behold, it was not towards him as yesterday, the third day.
{31:3} And Jehovah will say to Jacob, Turn back to the land of thy fathers, and to thy lineage; and I will be with thee.
{31:4} And Jacob will send and call to Rachel and to Leah in the field to his sheep.
{31:5} And will say to them, I saw the face of your father that it is not towards me as yesterday the third day: and the God of my father was with me.
{31:6} And ye yourselves knew that with all my strength I served, your father,
{31:7} And your father deceived me and changed my wages ten parts; and God gave him not to do evil by me.
{31:8} If thus he will say, The speckled shall be thy hire; and all the sheep shall bring forth speckled: and if thus he will say, The banded shall be thy hire, and all the sheep will bring forth white-footed.
{31:9} And God will take away the cattle of your father and will give them to me.
{31:10} And it shall be in the time the sheep shall conceive, and I shall lift up mine eyes, and I shall see in a dream, and behold, the he-goats ascending upon the sheep, banded, speckled and sprinkled with spots.
{31:11} And the messenger of God will say to me in a dream, Jacob: and I shall say, Behold me.
{31:12} And he will say, Lift up now thine eyes and see all the he-goats ascending upon the sheep, banded, speckled and sprinkled with spots; for I saw all that Laban did to thee.
{31:13} I the God of the house of God, where thou didst anoint there a pillar; where thou didst vow to me there a vow: now arise, go forth from this land, and turn back to the land of thy kindred.
{31:14} And Rachel will answer, and Leah, and they will say to him, Is yet to us a portion and inheritance in our father's house?
{31:15} Were we not reckoned strangers by him? for he sold us, and also eating, he ate up our silver.
{31:16} For all the riches which God took away from our father, that is to us and to our sons: and now all which God said to thee, do.
{31:17} And Jacob will rise, and lift up his sons and his wives upon the camels.
{31:18} And he will lead away all his cattle and all his horse which he acquired, the cattle of his acquisition, which he acquired in Padan Aram, to go to Isaak his father in the land of Canaan.
{31:19} And Laban went to shear his sheep; and Rachel will steal the family gods which were to her father.
{31:20} And Jacob will steal the heart of Laban the Syrian, for not announcing to him that he broke away.
{31:21} And he will break away, and all which was to him; and he will rise and pass over the river, and will set his face to Mount Gilead.
{31:22} And it will be announced to Laban in the third day, that Jacob broke away.
{31:23} And he will take his brethren with him, and pursue after him a way of seven days: and he will overtake him in Mount Gilead.
{31:24} And God will come to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night and will say to him, Watch to thyself, lest thou shalt speak with Jacob from good to evil.
{31:25} And Laban will overtake Jacob. And Jacob pitched his tent in the mount; and Laban pitched with his brethren in Mount Gilead.
{31:26} And Laban will say to Jacob, What didst thou and thou didst steal my heart, and will carry away my daughters as captives of the sword?
{31:27} For what didst thou hide to break away, and didst steal me, and didst not announce to me? and I will send thee away with gladness and with songs, with the drum and with the harp?
{31:28} And didst not permit me to kiss my sons and to my daughters? now thou wert foolish doing it.
{31:29} It is for the power of my hand mighty to do with you evil: and the God of your father yesterday spake to me, saying, Watch to thyself from speaking with Jacob from good to evil.
{31:30} And now going thou didst go, for desiring thou didst greatly desire after the house of thy father; for what didst thou steal my gods?
{31:31} And Jacob will answer and say to Laban, Because I was afraid; for I said, Lest thou wilt tear away my daughters from me;
{31:32} With whom thou shalt find thy gods, he shall not live: before our brethren, behold for thyself what is with me and take to thee: and Jacob knew not that Rachel stole them.
{31:33} And Laban will go into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maids, and he found them not And he will go out from the tent of Leah and will go into Rachel's tent.
{31:34} And Rachel took the family gods, and she will put them in the camel's saddle and will sit upon them. And Laban will feel all the tent, and he found not.
{31:35} And she will say to her father, My lord will not be angry in his eyes, that I shall not be able to rise from thy face, for the way of women is to me. And he will search and he found not the family gods,
{31:36} And it kindled to Jacob, and he will contend with Laban, and Jacob will answer and say to Laban, What my fault? what my sin that thou didst hotly pursue after me?
{31:37} That thou didst feel all my vessels, what didst thou find of all the vessels of thy house? Set here before my brethren and thy brethren, and they shall decide between us two.
{31:38} These twenty years I am with thee; thy sheep and thy she-goats were not barren, and the rams of thy flock, I ate not.
{31:39} The torn I brought not to thee; I shall bear the blame of it; from my hand thou will seek it, thefts of the day, and thefts of the night.
{31:40} I was in the day, the drought consumed me, and cold in the night, and sleep will flee away from mine eyes.
{31:41} Here to me twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy sheep; and thou wilt change my hire ten portions.
{31:42} If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaak was not with me, then now, empty thou hadst sent me away. My affliction and the labor of my hand God saw and he rebuked yesterday.
{31:43} And Laban will answer and say to Jacob, The daughters, my daughters, and the sons, my sons, and the sheep, my sheep, and all which thou sawest, this to me, and to my daughters: what shall I do to these this day, or to their sons which they brought forth?
{31:44} Now come thou we will make a covenant, I and thou; and it was for witness between me and between thee.
{31:45} And Jacob will take a stone and raise up a pillar.
{31:46} And Jacob will say to his brethren, Gather stones; and they will take stones and make a heap; and they will eat there upon the heap.
{31:47} And Laban will call it the heap of testimony, and Jacob called it the heap of witness.
{31:48} And Laban will say, This heap a witness between me and between thee this day, for this its name was called Gilead:
{31:49} And watchtower: for he said Jehovah will watch between me and between thee when we shall be concealed a man from his Mend.
{31:50} If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives to my daughters, no man is with us, seeing God a witness between me and between thee.
{31:51} And Laban will say to Jacob, Behold this heap; and behold the pillar which I cast between me and between thee.
{31:52} A witness this heap, and a witness the pillar, if I will not pass over this heap to thee, and thou shalt not pass over to me, this heap and this pillar for evil.
{31:53} The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor shall judge between us, the God of their father: and Jacob will swear by the fear of his father Isaak.
{31:54} And Jacob will sacrifice a sacrifice upon the mount, and will call to his brethren to eat bread, and they will eat bread, and they will pass the night in the mount.
{31:55} And Laban will rise up in the morning and will kiss his sons and his daughters, and will bless them: and Laban will go and turn back to his place.
{32:1} And Jacob went on his way and the messengers of God met with him.
{32:2} And Jacob will say when seeing them, This the camp of God: and he will call the name of that place the camps.
{32:3} And Jacob will send messengers before his face to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Adam.
{32:4} And he will command them, saying, Thus shall ye say to my lord to Esau, Thus thy servant Jacob said, With Laban I sojourned and lingered till now.
{32:5} And there will be to me ox and ass, sheep and servant, and maid; and I shall send to announce to my lord to find grace in thine eyes.
{32:6} And the messengers will turn back to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother, to Esau, and also he came to thy meeting, and four hundred men with him.
{32:7} And Jacob will be greatly afraid and it will press upon him: and he will divide the people which were with him, and the sheep and the oxen, and the camels, into two camps.
{32:8} And he will say, If Esau shall come to the one camp and smite it, and the remaining camp was to escape.
{32:9} And Jacob will say, God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaak, Jehovah having said to me, Turn back to thy land and to thy family, and I will do well with thee.
{32:10} I was little from all the kindness and from all the truth which thou didst to thy servant; for with my rod I passed over this Jordan, and now I became into two camps.
{32:11} Take me away now from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid of him, lest he shall come and smite me, the mother upon the sons.
{32:12} And thou saidst, Doing well I will do well with thee, and I set thy seed as the sand of the sea, which shall not be counted for multitude.
{32:13} And he will pass the night them in that night, and he will take from what came into his hand, a gift to Esau his brother.
{32:14} Two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats, two hundred sheep and twenty rams.
{32:15} Camels giving suck, and their young, thirty; forty heifers and ten bulls; twenty she-asses and ten foals.
{32:16} And he will give into the hand of his servants a flock, a flock itself alone; and he will say to his servants, Pass over before me, and ye shall put enlargement between flock and between flock.
{32:17} And he will command the first, saying, When Esau my brother shall meet thee and ask thee saying, To whom thou? and whither wilt thou go? and to whom these before thee?
{32:18} And thou saying, To thy servant, to Jacob: this a gift sent to my lord to Esau, and behold also he is behind us.
{32:19} And he will command also the second, also the third, also all going behind the flocks, saying, According to this word shall ye speak to Esau in your finding him.
{32:20} And ye said, Also behold thy servant Jacob behind us. For he said, I will appease his face with the gift going before me, and after this I will see his face; perhaps he will receive my face.
{32:21} And the gift will pass over before his face, and he remained in that night in the camp.
{32:22} And he will rise in that night and take his two wives and his two maids, and his eleven sons, and he will pass over the passage of Jabbok.
{32:23} And he will take them and will cause them to pass through the torrent, and he will cause to pass through what is to him.
{32:24} And Jacob will be left alone by himself, and a man will wrestle with him till the ascending of the morning.
{32:25} And he will see that he will not prevail over him and he will touch upon the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh will be alienated in his wrestling with him.
{32:26} And he will say, Send me away, for the morning ascended: and he will say, I will not send thee away, unless thou didst bless me.
{32:27} And he will say to him, What thy name? and he will say, Jacob.
{32:28} And he will say, Thy name shall no more be said Jacob, but Israel, for thou wert a prince with God and with men, and thou shalt prevail.
{32:29} And Jacob will ask and will say, Announce now, thy name: and he will say, For what this thou wilt ask for my name? and he will bless him there.
{32:30} And Jacob will call the name of the place, the face of God: for I saw God lace to face, and my soul shall be saved.
{32:31} And the sun will rise to him when he passed through the face of God, and he limped upon his thigh.
{32:32} For this, the sons of Israel will not eat the sinew which dried up which is upon the hollow of the thigh, even till this day; for he touched upon the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew which dried up.
{33:1} And Jacob will lift up his eyes and will see, and behold Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he will divide the children to Leah and to Rachel and to the two maids.
{33:2} And he set the maids and their children first, and Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph behind them.
{33:3} And he passed through before them, and he will bow himself upon the earth seven times till he brought himself near to his brother.
{33:4} And Esau will run to his meeting and he will embrace him and will fall upon his neck and will kiss him, and they will weep.
{33:5} And he will lift up his eyes and will see the women and the children, and he will say, To whom these to thee? And he will say, The children with whom God compassionated thy servant.
{33:6} And the maids will draw near, they and their children, and they will bow themselves.
{33:7} And Leah also will draw near, and her children, and they will bow themselves; and after, Joseph will draw near and Rachel, and they will prostrate themselves.
{33:8} And he will say, What to thee all this camp which I met? and he will say, To find grace in thine eyes, my lord.
{33:9} And Esau will say, There is much to me, my brother; what is to thee shall be to thee.
{33:10} And Jacob will say, Nay, now, if now I found grace in thine eyes, and take my gift from my hand, for, for this, I saw thy face as seeing the face of God, and thou wilt be satisfied with me.
{33:11} Take now my blessing which was brought to thee, for God compassionated me, and because all things are to me; and he will press upon him, and he will take.
{33:12} And he will say, We will remove and go, and I will go before thee.
{33:13} And he will say to him, My lord knew that the children are tender, and the sheep and the oxen bringing forth with me, and they overdrive them one day all the flock will die.
{33:14} Now my lord, shall pass through before his servant, and I will drive out softly, according to the foot of the work before me and according to the foot of the children, till I shall come to my lord to Seir.
{33:15} And Esau will say, I will leave now with thee, from the people which are to me; and he will say, For what this? I shall find grace in the eyes of my lord.
{33:16} And Esau will turn back in that day on his way to Seir.
{33:17} And Jacob will remove to the booths, and he will build for himself a house, and he made booths for his cattle; for this he called the name of the place Booths.
{33:18} And Jacob will go to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, in his going from Padan Aram; and he will encamp before the city.
{33:19} And he will buy a part of the field where he spread there his tent, from the hand of the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred lambs.
{33:20} And he will set there an altar, and he will call upon it, God the God of Israel.
{34:1} And Dinah, the daughter of Leah, which she brought forth to Jacob, will go forth to see the daughters of the land.
{34:2} And Shechem will see her, the son of Hamor the Hivite, chief of the land; will take her, and lie with her, and will humble her.
{34:3} And his soul will cleave to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he will love the maiden, and he will speak to the heart of the maiden.
{34:4} And Shechem will say to Hamor his father, saying, Take to me this maid for a wife.
{34:5} And Jacob heard that he defiled Dinah his daughter: and his sons were with his cattle in the field, and Jacob was silent till their coming.
{34:6} And Hamor the father of Shechem will go forth to Jacob to speak to him.
{34:7} And the sons of Jacob came from the field when they having heard: and the men will be grieved, and it will be kindled to them exceedingly because he did folly in Israel, to lie with Jacob's daughter; and thus it shall not be done.
{34:8} And Hamor will speak with them, saying, The soul of Shechem my son, was attached with his soul to your daughter; now give her to him for a wife.
{34:9} And contract ye marriages with us; ye shall give your daughters to us, and ye shall take our daughters to you.
{34:10} And ye shall dwell with us, and the land shall be before you; dwell ye and traffic in it, and take possession in it.
{34:11} And Shechem will say to her father, and to her brethren, Shall I find favor in your eyes? and what ye shall say to me I will give.
{34:12} Increase to me greatly the dowry and gift, and I will give according to that ye shall say to me; and ye shall give to me this maiden for a wife.
{34:13} And the sons of Jacob will answer Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit, and will say, Because he defiled Dinah their sister.
{34:14} And they will say to them, We shall not be able to do this word, to give our sister to a man which to him is uncircumcision; for this a reproach to us.
{34:15} But in this will we consent to you, if ye will be as we to circumcise to you every male;
{34:16} And we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you and be one people.
{34:17} And if ye will not listen to us to be circumcised, and we will take out daughter and depart.
{34:18} And their words will be pleasing in the eyes of Hamor, and in the eyes of Shechem, Hamor's son.
{34:19} And the youth deferred not to do the word, for he delighted in Jacob's daughter, and he was honorable more than all his father's house.
{34:20} And Hamor will come, and Shechem his son, to the gate of their city, and they will speak to the men of the city, saying,
{34:21} These men they are living peacefully with us, and they shall dwell in the land, and traffic in it; and the land, behold, being broad to the hands before them: we will take their daughters to us for wives, and give our daughters to them.
{34:22} Only in this will the men consent to us to dwell with us to be for one people, in the circumcising to us every male according as they having been circumcised.
{34:23} Their cattle and their possession and all their quadrupeds, shall they not be to us? only we will consent to them, and they will dwell with us.
{34:24} And to Hamor and to Shechem his son, will listen all going out of the gate of the city: and they will circumcise every male, all going out of the gate of the city.
{34:25} And it will be in the third day, in their having pain, and the two sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, will take a man his sword, and will go against the city securely, and will kill every male.
{34:26} And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son, with the mouth of the sword; and they will take Dinah from the house of Shechem, and go forth.
{34:27} The sons of Jacob came upon the wounded, and they will plunder the city, because they defiled their sister.
{34:28} Their sheep and their oxen and their asses, and what was in the city, and what in the field, they took.
{34:29} And all their force and all their little ones, and their wives they led captive, and they will plunder all which is in the house.
{34:30} And Jacob will say to Simeon and to Levi, Ye troubled me to make me evil to him dwelling in the land to the Canaanites, and to the Perizzites and I men of number, and they will gather together and smite me, and I all be destroyed, and my house.
{34:31} And they will say, Shall he do to our sister as an harlot?
{35:1} And God will say to Jacob, Arise, go up to the house of God and dwell there: and make there an altar to God, having been seen to thee in thy fleeing from the face of Esau thy brother.
{35:2} And Jacob will say to his house, and to all which are with him, Put away the strange gods which are among you, and be cleansed and change your garments.
{35:3} And we will arise and go to the house of God; and I will make there an altar to God, having answered me in the day of my distress; and he will be with me in the way which I go.
{35:4} And they will give to Jacob all the strange gods which are in their hand and the earrings which are in their ears, and Jacob will hide them under the turpentine tree which is in Shechem.
{35:5} And they will remove; and the terror of God will be upon the cities which are surrounding them; and they pursued not after the sons of Jacob.
{35:6} And Jacob will come to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (this the house of God), he and all the people which are with him.

{37:26} And Judah will say to his brethren, What the profit that we shall kill our brother, and conceal his blood?
{37:27} Come, and we will sell him to the Ishmaelites, and our hand shall not be upon him; for he our brother, our flesh: and his brethren will hear.
{37:28} And men will pass by, Midianites, merchants; and they will draw and bring up Joseph from the pit, and they will sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty of silver: and they will bring Joseph to Egypt.
{37:29} And Reuben turned back to the pit; and behold, Joseph not in the pit: and he rent his garments.
{37:30} And he will turn back to his brethren, and he will say, The child is not: and I, where shall I go?
{37:31} And they will take Joseph's tunic, and will slaughter a he-goat of the goats, and will dip the tunic in the blood.
{37:32} And they will send the tunic, reaching down to the soles of the feet, and will bring to their father, and they will say, We found this: recognise now, is this thy son's tunic or not?
{37:33} And he will recognise it, and will say, My son's tunic an evil beast devoured him: tearing in pieces, he tare Joseph in pieces.
{37:34} And Jacob will rend his garments, and will put sackcloth upon his loins, and will mourn for his son many days.
{37:35} And all his sons and all his daughters, will rise up to comfort him; and he will refuse to be comforted; and will say, For I will go down to my son mourning to hades; and his father will weep for him.
{37:36} And the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an eunuch of Pharaoh chief of the cooks.
{38:1} And it shall be in that time, and Judah will go down from his brethren, and will turn to a man, an Adullamite, and his name Hirah.
{38:2} And Judah will see there the daughter of a man, a Canaanite, and his name Shuah, and he will take her and will go in to her.
{38:3} And she will conceive and bring forth a son, and he will call his name Er.
{38:4} And she will conceive yet again and bear a son, and will call his name Onan.
{38:5} And she will add yet and bear a son, and will call his name Shelah: and he was in Chezib, in her bearing him.
{38:6} And Judah will take a wife for Er his first-born, and her name Tamar.
{38:7} And Er, Judah's first-born, will be evil in the eyes of Jehovah: and Jehovah will kill him.
{38:8} And Judah will say to Onan, go in to thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
{38:9} And Onan will know that not to him will be the seed; and it was when he went in to his brother's wife, he destroyed upon the earth, not to give seed to his brother.
{38:10} And it will be evil in the eyes of Jehovah, what he did, and he will kill him also.
{38:11} And Judah will say to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Sit a widow in thy father's house, till Shelah my son shall be great; (for he said, Lest this also shall die as his brethren.) And Tamar will go and will sit in her father's house.
{38:12} And the days will be multiplied, and the daughter of Shuah, Judah's wife, will die; and Judah will be comforted, and will go up to the shearers of his sheep, he and Hirah his friend the Adullamite, to Timnath.
{38:13} And it will be announced to Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law going up to Timnath to shear his sheep.
{38:14} And she will remove the garments of her widowhood from her, and she will be covered with a veil, and will veil herself and will sit in the entrance of the eyes, which is upon the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was great, and she was not given to him for a wife.
{38:15} And Judah will see her, and will think her a harlot, because she covered her face.
{38:16} And he will turn to her by the way, and will say, Now I will come in to thee; for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law: and she will say, What wilt thou give to me that thou wilt come in to me?
{38:17} And he will say, I will send a kid of the goats from the flock: and she will say, If thou wilt give a pledge till thy sending.
{38:18} And he will say, What the pledge which I shall give to thee? And she will say, Thy seal, and thy cord, and thy rod which is in thy hand: and he will give to her, and will go in to her, and she will conceive by him.
{38:19} And she will arise and go, and will put away her veil from her, and will put on the garments of her widowhood.
{38:20} And Judah will send the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to take the pledge from the hand of the woman; and he found her not.
{38:21} And he will ask the men of the place, saying, Where the harlot, she in the eyes upon the way? and they will say, No harlot was here.
{38:22} And he will turn back to Judah, and will say, I found her not; and also the men of the place said, No harlot was here.
{38:23} And Judah will say, She shall take to her, lest we shall be for a contempt: Behold, I sent this kid, and thou didst not find her.
{38:24} And it will be after three months, and it will be announced to Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law committed fornication; and also, behold, she conceived by fornication. And Judah will say, Bring her forth, and she shall be burnt.
{38:25} She being brought forth, and she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man whose are these, by him I conceived. And she will say, Recognise, now, to whom the seal, the cords, and the rod, these.
{38:26} And Judah will recognise, and will say, She was justified more than I, because that I gave her not to Shelah my son: and he will not add to know her yet again.
{38:27} And it will be in the time of her bringing forth, and behold, twins in her womb.
{38:28} And it will be in her bringing forth, and he will give the hand; and the midwife will take and bind upon his hand, scarlet, saying, This came forth first.
{38:29} And it will be after turning back his hand, and behold his brother will come forth; and she will say, How didst thou break forth? the breach upon thee: and his name shall be called.
{38:30} And afterward his brother will come forth, whom upon his hand the scarlet, and his name shall be called Zarah.
{39:1} And Joseph was brought down to Egypt: and Potiphar will buy him, Pharaoh's eunuch, chief of the cooks, an Egyptian man, from the hand of the Ishmaelites who brought him down there.
{39:2} And Jehovah will be with Joseph, and the man will be prospering: and he will be in the house of his lord the Egyptian.
{39:3} And his lord will see that Jehovah is with him, and all that he did Jehovah prospering in his hand.
{39:4} And Joseph will find grace in his eyes, and he will serve him, and he will appoint him over his house, and all which is to him he gave into his hand.
{39:5} And it will be from the time he appointed him over his house, and over all which is to him, and Jehovah will bless the Egyptian's house on account of Joseph; and the blessing of Jehovah will be upon all which is to him in the house and in the field.
{39:6} And he will let go all which is to him into the hand of Joseph; and he will not, know anything except the bread which he is eating: and Joseph will be fair of form, and fair of look.
{39:7} And it will be after these words, and his lord's wife will lift up her eyes to Joseph, and she will say, Lie with me.
{39:8} And he will refuse, and will say to his lord's wife, Behold, my lord knew not what is with me in the house, and all which is to him he gave into my hand;
{39:9} Nothing is great in this house above me: and he kept not back anything from me except thee, because thou his wife: and how shall I do this great evil and sin before God?
{39:10} And it will be in her speaking to Joseph day by day, and he listened not to her to he by her, to be with her.
{39:11} And it will be about this day, and he will come into the house to do his work: and no man from the men of the house there in the house.
{39:12} And she will seize him by his garment, saying, Lie with me. And he will let go his garment in her hand, and will flee and come forth without.
{39:13} And it will be when she saw that he let go his garment in her hand and will flee without,
{39:14} And she will call the men of her house and will say to them, saying, See ye, he brought to us a Hebrew man to mock us: he came to me to lie with me, and I shall cry with a great voice.
{39:15} And it will be as he heard me that I lifted up my voice and I will cry, and he will let go his garment by me, will flee and come forth without.
{39:16} And she will leave his garment by her till his lord came to his house.
{39:17} And she will speak to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant which thou broughtest to us, came in to me to mock me.
{39:18} And it will be as I lifted up my voice, and I will cry out, and he will let go his garment by me and will flee without.
{39:19} And it will be as his lord heard the words of his wife which she spake to him, saying, According to these words thy servant did to me; and his anger will be kindled.
{39:20} And Joseph's lord will take him and put him into the house of the fortress, the place where the king's prisoners were bound; and he shall be there in the house of the fortress.
{39:21} And Jehovah will be with Joseph, and will extend to him kindness, and will give his grace in the eyes of the chief of the house of the fortress.
{39:22} And the chief of the house of the fortress will give into Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the house of the fortress; and all which was done there he was doing.
{39:23} The chief of the house of the fortress saw not all the things in his hand, because Jehovah was with him: and what he did Jehovah prospering.
{40:1} And it will be after these words, The cup-bearer of the king of Egypt, and the baker, sinned to their lord the king of Egypt.
{40:2} And Pharaoh will be angry against his two eunuchs, against the chief of the cup-bearers, and against the chief of the bakers.
{40:3} And he will give them in guard in the house of the chief of the cooks, to the house of the fortress, the place where Joseph was bound there.
{40:4} And the chief of the cooks will appoint Joseph over them, and he will serve them; and they will be days in guard.
{40:5} And they will dream a dream, they two, a man his dream in one night, a man according to the interpretation of his dream; the cup-bearer and the baker which were to the king of Egypt, who were bound in the house of the fortress.
{40:6} And Joseph will come to them in the morning, and will see them, and behold, they sad.
{40:7} And he will ask Pharaoh's eunuchs which were with him in guard of the house of his lord, saying, Why are your faces evil this day?
{40:8} And they will say to him, We dreamed a dream, and there is none interpreting it And Joseph will say to them, Are not interpretations to God? Relate now to me.
{40:9} And the chief of the cup-bearers will relate his dream to Joseph, and will say to him, In my dream, and behold a vine before me;
{40:10} And in the vine three shoots; and this as flourishing, its leaf went forth; the clusters of grapes were ripened.
{40:11} And Pharaoh's cup in my hand; and I shall take the grapes and press them into Pharaoh's cup, and I shall give the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
{40:12} And Joseph will say to him, This its interpretation: The three shoots they are three days.
{40:13} Yet in three days Pharaoh will lift up thy head, and restore thee to thy place, and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, according to thy first judgment, when thou wert his cup-bearer.
{40:14} But remember me with thyself, when it shall be well to thee, and now do kindness to me, and remember me to Pharaoh and bring me out of this house.
{40:15} For by stealing, I was stolen from the land of the Hebrews: and also here, I have not done anything that they put me in the pit.
{40:16} And the chief of the bakers see that he interpreted good, and he will say to Joseph, I also in my dream, and behold, three wicker baskets of white bread upon my head.
{40:17} And in the high basket of all, food of Pharaoh, the work of baking; and the birds ate them from the basket above my head.
{40:18} And Joseph will answer and say, This its interpretation: the three baskets, they are three days;
{40:19} Yet in three days, Pharaoh will lift up thy head above thee, and hang thee upon a tree, and the birds shall eat thy flesh from thee.
{40:20} And it will be in the third day, the day of the birth of Pharaoh, and he will make a drinking to all his servants; and he will lift up the head of the chief of the cup-bearers, and the head of the chief of the bakers, in the midst of his servants.
{40:21} And he will restore the chief of the cup-bearers to his possession; and he will give the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
{40:22} And he will hang the chief of the bakers, according to what Joseph interpreted to them.
{40:23} And the chief of the cup-bearers did not remember Joseph, and he will forget him.
{41:1} And it will be the end of two years of days, and Pharaoh dreamed; and behold, he stood by the river.
{41:2} And behold, from the river came up seven heifers, fair of look and fat in flesh; and they will feed in marsh grass.
{41:3} Behold, seven other heifers coming up after them out of the river, evil of look, thin in flesh; and they will stand by the heifers by the lip of the river.
{41:4} And the heifers evil of look and thin of flesh, will devour the seven heifers fair of look, and fat. And Pharaoh will awake.
{41:5} And he will sleep, and will dream the second time, and behold seven ears coming upon one stalk, fat and good.
{41:6} And behold, seven ears thin and blasted by the east, springing up after them.
{41:7} And the thin ears will devour the seven ears fat and full. And Pharaoh will awake, and behold, a dream.
{41:8} And it will be in the morning, and his soul will be troubled; and he will send and call all the sacred scribes of Egypt, and all his wise; and Pharaoh will relate to them his dream; and none interpreting them to Pharaoh.
{41:9} And the chief of the cup-bearers will speak to Pharaoh, saying, I, remembering my sin this day.
{41:10} Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and gave me in guard in the house of the chief of the cooks, me and the chief of the bakers.
{41:11} And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he: we dreamed a man according to the interpretation of his dream.
{41:12} And there with us a Hebrew youth, servant to the chief of the cooks: and we shall relate to him, and he will interpret to us our dreams; and he interpreted a man according to his dream.
{41:13} And it will be according to that he interpreted to us, thus it was: me he restored to my place, and him he hung.
{41:14} And Pharaoh will send and call Joseph, and they will cause him to run from the pit; and he will be shaved and will change his garments; and he will come to Pharaoh.
{41:15} And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, I dreamed a dream, and there is none interpreting it, and I heard concerning thee, saying, Thou wilt hear a dream to interpret it.
{41:16} And Joseph will answer Pharaoh, saying, Not in me: God will answer Pharaoh with peace.
{41:17} And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, In my dream I stood by the lip of the river.
{41:18} And behold, from the river came up seven heifers, fat of flesh and fair of form, and they will feed in marsh grass.
{41:19} And behold, seven other heifers coming up after them, poor and evil exceedingly, in form, and thin in flesh I saw not like them in all the land of Egypt for evil.
{41:20} And the heifers thin and evil will devour the first seven fat heifers.
{41:21} And they shall come into their belly, and they shall not know that they came into their belly; and evil of form as that in the beginning. And I shall awake.
{41:22} And I shall see in my dream, and behold, seven ears coming up in one stalk, full and good.
{41:23} And behold, seven ears dry, thin, blasted by the east, springing up after them.
{41:24} And the thin ears will swallow the seven good ears: and I spake to the sacred scribes, and there was none announcing to me.
{41:25} And Joseph will say to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh, one: this which he did; God announces to Pharaoh.
{41:26} The seven good heifers, they are seven years; and the seven good ears, they are seven years: this dream one.
{41:27} And the seven heifers, thin and evil, coming up after them, they are seven years; and the seven ears, thin, blasted by the east, shall be seven years of famine.
{41:28} This the word which I spake to Pharaoh: what God did, he showed Pharaoh.
{41:29} Behold, seven years coming of great plenty, in all the land of Egypt.
{41:30} And seven years of famine arose after them, and all the plenty was forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine consumed the land.
{41:31} And the plenty shall not be known in the land on account of the famine after this; for it shall be exceedingly heavy.
{41:32} And because of the repeating of Pharaoh's dream twice, that the word was prepared from God; and God is hastening to do it.
{41:33} And now will Pharaoh look out a man discerning and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
{41:34} And will Pharaoh make and appoint overseers over the land, exacting a fifth part of the land of Egypt, in the seven years of plenty.
{41:35} And they shall gather all the food of these good years coming, and they shall heap up the grain under the hand of Pharaoh, and they shall watch food in the cities.
{41:36} And the food was for a deposit to the land, for the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; and the land shall not be cut off in the famine.
{41:37} And the word will be good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
{41:38} And Pharaoh will say to his servants, Shall we find such as this man which has the spirit of God in him?
{41:39} And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, After that God showed thee all this, none discerning and wise as thou.
{41:40} Thou shalt be over my house, and to thy mouth all my people shall bend: only upon the throne I shall be great above thee.
{41:41} And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, See, I gave thee over all the land of Egypt.
{41:42} And Pharaoh will remove his signet ring from his hand, and will give it upon Joseph's hand; and will put upon him a white garment, and will put a gold collar about his neck.
{41:43} And he will cause him to ride in the second chariot which is to him. And they will cry out before him, Aback. And he gave him over all the land of Egypt.
{41:44} And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, I am Pharaoh; and without thee, a man shall not lift up his hand and his foot in all the land of Egypt.
{41:45} And Pharaoh will call Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he will give to him Asenath, daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of Ain, for a wife; and Joseph will go forth over the land of Egypt.
{41:46} And Joseph the son of thirty years in his standing before Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and Joseph will go forth from the face of Pharaoh, and will pass over all the land of Egypt.
{41:47} And the earth will make in the seven years of plenty by handfuls.
{41:48} And he will gather all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and he will give the food in the cities: the food of the field of the city which round about her, he gave in the midst of her.
{41:49} And Joseph will gather grain as the sand of the sea, exceedingly much that he ceased to number; for there was no numbering.
{41:50} And to Joseph will be born two sons before the years of the famine will come: which Asenath, daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of Ain, bare to him.
{41:51} And Joseph will call the name of the first-born, Manasseh; for God made me forget all my toils and all my father's house.
{41:52} And the name of the second, he called Ephraim; for God caused me to flourish in the land of my affliction.
{41:53} And the seven years of plenty will be completed, which was in the land of Egypt.
{41:54} And the seven years of famine will begin to come, according to that Joseph said: and the famine will be in all the lands; and in all the land of Egypt was bread.
{41:55} And all the land of Egypt shall hunger, and the people will cry out to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh will say to all Egypt, Go to Joseph; what he shall say to you, ye shall do.
{41:56} And the famine was upon all the face of the earth: and Joseph will open all which in them, and he will sell to Egypt; and the famine was strong in the land of Egypt.
{41:57} And all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy, for the famine was strong in all the earth.
{42:1} And when Jacob shall see there is selling in Egypt, Jacob will say to his sons, For what will ye look?
{42:2} Behold I heard that there is selling in Egypt: go ye there, and buy grain for us from thence; and we shall live and shall not die.
{42:3} And Joseph's brethren, the ten, will go to buy grain from Egypt.
{42:4} And Benjamin, Josephs brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest harm should meet him.
{42:5} And the sons of Israel will come to buy in the midst of those coming; for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
{42:6} And Joseph, he the ruler over the land, and he selling grain to all the people of the earth; and Joseph's brethren will come, and will worship before him the face to the earth.
{42:7} And Joseph will see his brethren, and will know them, and he will not let himself be known to them. And will speak with them hard things: and he will say to them, From whence came ye? And they will say, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
{42:8} And Joseph will know his brethren, and they knew him not.
{42:9} And Joseph will remember the dreams which he dreamed concerning them, and he will say to them, Ye spying; to see the naked places of the land ye came.
{42:10} And they will say to him, Nay my lord, and thy servants came to buy food.
{42:11} We all one man's sons; we true; we thy servants were not spying.
{42:12} And he will say to them, Nay, to see the naked places of the land ye came.
{42:13} And they will say, Thy servants twelve brethren; we the sons of one man in the land of Canaan: and behold, the little one with our father this day, and one, not.
{42:14} And Joseph will say to them, This which I spake to you, saying, Ye spying:
{42:15} In this ye shall be proved; Pharaoh living, if ye shall go forth from here except in the coming of your brother, the little one hither.
{42:16} Send one of you and he shall take your brother, and ye to be bound, and your words shall be proved, whether the truth with you; and if not, Pharaoh living, for ye are spying.
{42:17} And he will gather them to guard three days.
{42:18} And Joseph will say to them in the third day, This do ye, and live, I fearing God.
{42:19} If ye true, one of your brethren shall be bound in the house of your guard, and ye yourselves go carry the selling for the famine of your houses.
{42:20} And ye shall bring your little brother to me, and your words shall be believed, and ye shall not die. And they will do so.
{42:21} And they will say, a man to his brother, Truly we guilty concerning our brother, when we saw the straits of his soul in his entreating us, and we heard him not; for this, these straits are come to us.
{42:22} And Reuben will answer them, saying, Spake I not to you, saying, Ye shall not sin against the child; and ye heard not? and also behold his blood was required.
{42:23} And they will not know that Joseph heard them, for an interpreter between them.
{42:24} And he will turn about from them, and will weep; and he will turn back to them and speak to them, and he will take from them Simeon, and will bind him before their eyes.
{42:25} And Joseph will command, and they will fill their vessels with grain, and turn back their silver to a man, into his sack, and give to them provision for the way: and he will do thus to them.
{42:26} And they will lift up the grain upon their asses, and they will go from thence.
{42:27} And the one will open his sack to give food to his ass in the lodging place, and he will see his silver; for behold, it in the mouth of his sack.
{42:28} And he will say to his brethren, My silver restored; and also behold in my sack: and their heart will go forth and they will tremble, a man saying to his brother, What this God did to us?
{42:29} And they will come to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and they will announce to him all having happened to them, saying,
{42:30} The man, the lord of the land, spake to us hard things, and he will give us for spying the land.
{42:31} And we shall say to him, We are true; we were not spying;
{42:32} We are twelve brethren, sons of our father: one is not, and the little one, he with our father in the land of Canaan.
{42:33} And the man, the lord of the land, will say to us, In this I shall know that ye are true; leave one of your brethren with me, and take for the famine of your houses and go.
{42:34} And bring your little brother to me, and I shall know that ye are not spying, but ye are true: I will give to you your brother and ye shall traffic in the land.
{42:35} And it will be in their emptying their sacks, and behold, the bundle of silver of each in his sack: and they will see the bundles of their silver, they and their father, and they will be afraid.
{42:36} And Jacob their father will say to them, Me ye bereaved of children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin: all these things were against me.
{42:37} And Reuben will speak to his father, saying, Kill my two sons, if I shall not bring him to thee: give him into my hand, and I will turn him back to thee.
{42:38} And he will say, My son shall not go down with you, for his brother died, and he alone was left: and harm meeting him in the way in which ye shall go, and ye bring down my old age with grief to hades.
{43:1} And the famine was heavy upon the earth.
{43:2} And it shall be when they finished eating the grain which they brought from Egypt, their father will say to them, Turn back, buy for us a little food.
{43:3} And Judah will speak to him, saying, Protesting, the man protested to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother is with you.
{43:4} If thou art sending our brother with us we will go down and will buy food for thee.
{43:5} And if thou art not sending, we will not go down, for the man said to us, Ye shall not see my face except your brother is with you.
{43:6} And Israel will say, For what did ye evil to me to announce to the man to be yet a brother to you?
{43:7} And they will say, Asking, the man asked about us and about our family, saying, Is your father yet living? is there a brother to you? and we announced to him according to the mouth of these words: Knowing, did we know that he will say, Bring down your brother?
{43:8} And Judah will say to Israel his father, Send the youth with me, and we will arise and go; and we shall live and not die, also we, also thou, also our little ones.
{43:9} I will be surety for him; from my hand shalt thou seek him, if I brought him not to thee and set him before thee, I sinned before thee all the days.
{43:10} For unless we lingered we had turned back this twice.
{43:11} And Israel their father will say to them, If so now, do this; take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down to the man a gift of a little balsam, and a little honey and spice and resin, pistacia nuts, and almonds.
{43:12} And take of twice the silver in your hands; and the silver turned back in the mouth of your sacks, ye shall turn back in your hand; perhaps it was an error.
{43:13} And take your brother and arise, turn back to the man.
{43:14} And God Almighty will give to you mercy before the man, and send you your one brother and Benjamin: and when I was bereaved of children, I was bereaved of children.
{43:15} And the men will take this gift, and they took double the silver in their hand, and Benjamin; and they will rise up and go down to Egypt, and they will stand before Joseph.
{43:16} And Joseph will see Benjamin with them, and he will say to him over his house, Bring the men to the house, and slaughter a slaughter, and make ready, for the men shall eat with me at noon.
{43:17} And the man will do according to what Joseph said: and the man will bring the men into Joseph's house.
{43:18} And the men will be afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they will say, For the word of the silver turned back in our sacks at the beginning, we were brought in; to roll himself upon us and to fall upon us and to take us for servants and our asses.
{43:19} And they will come near the man which was over Joseph's house, and they will say to him at the entrance of the house,
{43:20} And they will say, With leave my lord, coming down, we came down at the beginning to buy food.
{43:21} And it will be as we came to the lodging place, and we opened our sacks, and behold, the silver of each in the mouth of his sack, our silver in weight: and we turned it back in our hand.
{43:22} And other silver we brought down in our hand to buy food: we knew not who put our silver in our sacks.
{43:23} And he will say, Peace to you, ye shall not be afraid; your God, and the God of your father, gave to you treasure in your sacks: your silver came to me. And he brought forth to them. Simeon.
{43:24} And the man will bring the men into Joseph's house, and will give water, and they will wash their feet; and he will give fodder to their asses.
{43:25} And they will make ready the gift at the coming of Joseph at noon: for they heard that they shall eat bread there.
{43:26} And Joseph will come to his house and they will bring to him the gift which is in their hand to the house, and they will worship towards him to the earth.
{43:27} And he will ask them concerning peace, and he will say, Is it peace to your father, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet living?
{43:28} And they will say, Peace to thy servant to our father, he is yet living: and they will bow down and worship.
{43:29} And he will lift up his eyes and see his brother Benjamin, the son of his mother, and he will say, This your little brother of whom ye spake to me? and he will say, God will compassionate thee my son.
{43:30} And Joseph will hasten; for his bowels will move to his brother: and he will seek to weep, and he will go to his store-chamber and will weep there.
{43:31} And he will wash his face and come forth, and will restrain himself, and will say, Place bread.
{43:32} And they will set for him alone, and for them alone, and the Egyptians eating with him, alone; for the Egyptians will not be able to eat bread with the Hebrews; for it is abomination to the Egyptians.
{43:33} And they will set before him, the first-born, according to his seniority, and the small according to his minority: and the men will wonder each at his friend.
{43:34} And he will take gifts from before him to them: and Benjamin's gift will increase above all their gifts, five parts. And they will drink and be intoxicated with him.
{44:1} And he will command him over house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they shall be able to lift up, and put the silver of each in the mouth of his sack.
{44:2} And my cup, the silver cup, thou shalt put in the sack's mouth of the small one, and the silver of his grain; and he will do according to the word which Joseph spake.
{44:3} The morning shone, and the men were sent away, they and their asses.
{44:4} They came forth out of the city, they were not far off, and Joseph said to him over his house, Arise, pursue after the men, and having overtaken them, and say to them, For what did ye requite evil for good?
{44:5} Is it not this which my lord will drink in it, and divining he will divine in it? ye were evil in which ye did.
{44:6} And he will overtake them, and will speak to them these words.
{44:7} And they will say to him, For what will my lord speak according to these words? far be it for thy servants to do according to this word.
{44:8} Behold, the silver which we found in the mouth of our sacks, we turned back to thee from the land of Canaan: and how shall we steal from thy lord's house, silver or gold?
{44:9} With whomsoever of thy servants it shall be found, and he shall die, and also we will be for servants to my lord.
{44:10} And he will say, Also now according to your words let it be thus: with whomsoever it shall be found, he shall be servant to me, and ye shall be pure.
{44:11} And they will hasten, and will take down each his sack to the earth, and they will open each his sack.
{44:12} And he will search, beginning at the great and finishing at the small: and he will find the cup in Benjamin's sack.
{44:13} And they will rend their garments, and will lift up each upon his ass, and will turn back to the city.
{44:14} And Judah and his brethren will come to Joseph's house, and he yet there: and they will fall before him to the earth.
{44:15} And Joseph will say to them, What this deed ye did? knew ye not that divining, a man shall divine such as I?
{44:16} And Judah will say to him, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? and how shall we be justified? God found the iniquity of thy servants: behold we are servants to my lord, also we, also him the cup being found in his hand.
{44:17} And he will say, Far be it for me to do this: the man in whose band the cup being found, he shall be servant to me; and ye, go ye up in peace to your father.
{44:18} And Judah will come near to him and will say, With leave my lord, now shall thy servant speak a word in the ear of my lord, and thine anger shall not be kindled against thy servant; for with thee as Pharaoh.
{44:19} My lord didst ask thy servants, saying, Is there a father to you, or a brother?
{44:20} And we said to my lord, There is a father to us, an old man, and a child of old age, a little one: and his brother died, and he will be left alone to his mother; and his father loved him.
{44:21} And thou wilt say to thy servants, Bring him down to me, and I shall set mine eyes upon him.
{44:22} And we shall say to my lord, The youth will not be able to leave his father; and did he leave his father, he died.
{44:23} And thou wilt say to thy servants, If your little brother shall not come down with you, ye shall not add to see my face.
{44:24} And it shall be when we went up to thy servant our father, and announced to him the words of, my lord.
{44:25} And our father will say, Turn back and buy for us a little food.
{44:26} And we shall say, We shall not be able to go down: if our little brother is with us, and we will go down; for we shall not be able to see the man's face, and our little brother not with us.
{44:27} And thy servant my father will say to us, Ye knew that my wife brought forth to me two.
{44:28} And the one went forth from me and it was said, Surely he was torn in pieces, he was torn in pieces; and I saw him not till now.
{44:29} And took ye this also from my face, and harm befell him, and ye brought down my old age with evil to hades.
{44:30} And now if I came to thy servant my father, and the youth not with us, for his soul is bound upon his soul,
{44:31} And it was when he having seen that the youth is not, and he will die: and thy servants brought down the old age of thy servant our father in grief to hades.
{44:32} For thy servant became surety for the youth with my father, saying, If I shall not bring him to thee, I sinned against my father all the days.
{44:33} At this time thy servant shall now remain for the youth, a servant to my lord; and the youth shall go up with his brethren.
{44:34} For how shall I go up to my father and the youth not with me? lest I shall look upon the evil which shall find my father.
{45:1} And Joseph will not be able to restrain himself before all standing by him; and he will cry out, Take out every man from me: and a man stood not with him, in Joseph's making himself known to his brethren.
{45:2} And he will give forth his voice in weeping, and the Egyptians will hear and the house of Pharaoh will hear.
{45:3} And Joseph will say to his brethren, I am Joseph; is my father yet living? and his brethren will not be able to answer him; for they trembled from before him.
{45:4} And Joseph will say to his brethren, Come near now to me: and they will come near, and he will say, I am Joseph, your brother, whom ye sold me into Egypt.
{45:5} And now, ye shall not be grieved, and it shall not burn in your eyes, because ye sold me here: for God sent me before you for the preservation of life.
{45:6} For this the second year of the famine in the midst of the land: and yet five years in which no ploughing and reaping.
{45:7} And God will send me before you to put for you a remnant upon the earth, and to preserve life for you by a great deliverance.
{45:8} And now not you sent me here, but God: and he placed me for a father to Pharaoh, and for lord to all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
{45:9} Hasten and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus said thy son Joseph, God placed me for lord to all Egypt; come down to me, thou wilt not remain.
{45:10} And thou didst dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou wert near to me, thou, and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, and thy sheep and thine oxen and all which is to thee.
{45:11} And I nourished thee there (for yet five years of famine), lest thou shalt be poor, thou and thy house, and all which is to thee.
{45:12} And behold, your eyes seeing, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that my mouth is speaking to you.
{45:13} And ye announced to my father all my glory in Egypt, and all which ye have seen: and haste ye, and bring ye down my father here.
{45:14} And he will fall upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and will weep; and and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
{45:15} And he will kiss all his brethren, and will weep upon them: and after this his brethren sake with him.
{45:16} And the voice was heard in the house of Pharaoh, saying, Joseph's brethren came; and it will be good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants.
{45:17} And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, Say to thy brethren, This do ye: your cattle and come, go to the land of Canaan.
{45:18} And take your father and your houses, and come to me: and I will give to you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the heart of the land.
{45:19} And thou being commanded, this do ye; take to you from the land of Egypt, wagons for your little ones, and for your wives, and take your father and come.
{45:20} And your eye shall not spare upon your vessels: for the good of all the land of Egypt is to you.
{45:21} And the sons of Israel will do so: and Joseph will give to them wagons, by the mouth of Pharaoh, and he will give to them provision for the way.
{45:22} To all of them he gave, to each, changes of garments: and to Benjamin he gave three hundred of silver and five changes of garments.
{45:23} And to his father he sent according to this: ten asses lifting up from the good of Egypt, and ten she-asses lifting up grain and bread: and food for his father for the way.
{45:24} And he will send his brethren away, and they will go; and he will say to them, Ye shall not be angry in the way.
{45:25} And they will go up from Egypt, and will come to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.
{45:26} And they will announce to him, saying, Joseph is yet living, and that he the ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart will be cold for he believed them not.
{45:27} And they will say to him all the words of Joseph which he spake to them: and he will see the wagons which Joseph sent to take him, and the spirit of Jacob their father will live.
{45:28} And Israel will say, It is much: Joseph my son is yet living: I will go and see him before I shall die.
{46:1} And Israel will remove and all which is to him, and he will come to the well of the oath, and he will sacrifice sacrifices to the God of his father Isaak.
{46:2} And God will speak to Israel in a vision of the night, and he will say, Jacob! Jacob! and he will say, Behold me.
{46:3} And he will say, I am God, the God of thy father: thou shalt not fear going down to Egypt; for I will there make thee into a great nation.
{46:4} I will go down with thee to Egypt, and I will raise thee up; and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
{46:5} And Jacob will rise up from the well of the oath: and the sons of Israel will take up Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh sent to take him.
{46:6} And they will take their cattle and their goods which they acquired in the land of Canaan, and they will come to Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him;
{46:7} His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed, he brought with him to Egypt.
{46:8} And these the names of the sons of Israel having come to Egypt. Jacob and his sons: the first born of Jacob, Reuben.
{46:9} And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch and Phallu and Hezron and Carmi.
{46:10} And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin, and Zohar and Saul, son of the Canaanitess.

{46:13} And the sons of Issachar: Tola and Phuvah, and Job and Shimron.
{46:14} And the sons of Zebulon, Sered and Elon and Jahleel.
{46:15} These the sons of Leah, which she bare to Jacob in Padan-Aram, and Dinah his daughter; all the souls of his sons and his daughters thirty and three.
{46:16} And the sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shumi and Ezbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli.
{46:17} And the sons of Asher: Jimnath and Ishuah and Isui and Beriah, and Sarah their sister. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
{46:18} These the sons of Zilpah whom Laban gave to Leah Iris daughter. And she will bear these to Jacob, sixteen souls.
{46:19} The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
{46:20} And to Joseph will be born in the land of Egypt, whom Asenath will bear to him, the daughter of Poti-Phera, priest of Ain: Manasseh and Ephraim.
{46:21} And the sons of Benjamin: Bela and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard.
{46:22} These the sons of Rachel which she bare to Jacob; all the souls fourteen.

{46:27} And the sons of Joseph which were born to him in Egypt, two souls: to the house of Jacob coming to Egypt, seventy.
{46:28} And he sent Judah before him to Joseph to cast his face to Goshen, and they came to the land of Goshen.
{46:29} And Joseph will harness his chariot, and will go up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he will be seen to him: and he will fall upon his neck, and will yet weep upon his neck.
{46:30} And Israel will say to Joseph, Now will I die, after I saw thy face, because thou art yet living.
{46:31} And Joseph will say to his brethren, and to his father's house, I will go up and announce to Pharaoh, and say to him, My brethren and my father's house which were in the land of Canaan, came to me.
{46:32} And the men are shepherds of sheep, for they were men of cattle; and they brought their sheep and their cattle, and all which is to them.
{46:33} And it will be when Pharaoh shall call to you and say, What your work?
{46:34} And saying, Thy servants were men of cattle from our childhood and till now; also we, also our fathers; that ye shall dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd of sheep is an abomination to the Egyptians.
{47:1} And Joseph will come and announce to Pharaoh, and will say, My father and my brethren, and their sheep and their cattle and all which is to them, came from the land of Canaan, and behold, in the land of Goshen.
{47:2} And he took from the whole number of his brethren five men and set them before Pharaoh.
{47:3} And Pharaoh will say to his brethren, What your work? and they will say to Pharaoh, Thy servants were feeding sheep, also we, also our fathers.
{47:4} And they will say to Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land we came: for no pasture is to the sheep which are to thy servants, for the famine was heavy in the land of Canaan: and at this time now will thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
{47:5} And Pharaoh will speak to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren came to thee.
{47:6} This land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land cause thy father and thy brethren to dwell; they shall dwell in the land of Goshen; and if thou knowest and there is among them men of strength, set them leaders of the cattle which are to me.
{47:7} And Joseph will bring Jacob his father and will set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob will bless Pharaoh.
{47:8} And Pharaoh will say to Jacob, How many the days of the years of thy life?
{47:9} And Jacob will say to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my sojourning, thirty and a hundred years: little and evil were the days of the years of my life, and they reached not the days of the years of the life of my fathers in their sojournings.
{47:10} And Jacob will bless Pharaoh, and he will go out from before Pharaoh.
{47:11} And Joseph will place his father and his brethren, and will give to them possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, according to what Pharaoh commanded.
{47:12} And Joseph will nourish his father and his brethren, and all the house of his father, with bread according to the mouth of the little ones.
{47:13} And no bread in all the land; for the famine was heavy exceedingly, and the land of Egypt was exhausted, and the land of Canaan, from before the famine.
{47:14} And Joseph will gather together all the silver being found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph will bring the silver to the house of Pharaoh.
{47:15} And the silver will be spent from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan; and all the Egyptians will go to Joseph, saying, Give to us bread: and for what shall we die before thee? for the silver failed.
{47:16} And Joseph will say, Give your cattle; and I will give to you for your cattle if silver failed.
{47:17} And they will bring their cattle to Joseph, and Joseph will give to them bread for horses, and for the possession of the sheep, and for the possession of the cattle, and for the asses; and he will feed them with bread, for all their cattle for that year.
{47:18} And that year will be ended, and they will come to him in the second year, and will say to him, We will not hide from my lord if the silver was spent; and the possession of the cattle to my lord; and there was not left before my lord except but our bodies and our lands.
{47:19} For what shall we die before thine eyes, also we, also our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh: and give seed, and we shall live and not die, and the land shall not be laid waste.
{47:20} And Joseph will buy all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold each his field, for the famine was strong over them: and the land will be to Pharaoh.
{47:21} And the people, he made them pass over to the cities from the extremity of the bounds of Egypt, and even to the extremity.
{47:22} Only the land of the priests he bought not; for to the priests a portion from Pharaoh, and they ate their portion which Pharaoh gave to them; for this they sold not their lands.
{47:23} And Joseph will say to the people, Behold, I bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, seed for you, and sow ye the land.
{47:24} And it was in the produce, and ye gave the fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be to you, for the seed of the field and for your food, and for those in your houses, and for food to your little ones.
{47:25} And they will say, Thou didst preserve us alive: shall we find grace in the eyes of my lord, we were servants to Pharaoh.
{47:26} And Joseph set it for an ordinance to this day, of the land of Egypt, for a fifth to Pharaoh; only the land of the priests alone was not to Pharaoh.
{47:27} And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt in the land of Goshen; and they will have possession in it, and be fruitful, and will multiply greatly.
{47:28} And Jacob will live in the land of Egypt seventeen years: and the days of the years of the life of Jacob will be seven years and forty years, and a hundred years.
{47:29} And the days of Israel will draw near to die: and he will call to his son Joseph, and will say to him, If now I found grace in thine eyes, put now thy hand under my thigh, and thou shalt do to me kindness and truth: now thou shalt not bury me in Egypt.
{47:30} I will lie down with my fathers, and thou shalt lift me up out of Egypt, and thou shalt bury me in their grave. And he will say, I will do according to thy word.
{47:31} And he will say, Swear to me. And he will swear to him. And Israel will worship upon the head of the rod.
{48:1} And it shall be after these words, and it will be said to Joseph, Behold, thy father was sick: and he will take his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim.
{48:2} And it will be announced to Jacob, and it will be said, Behold, thy son Joseph came to thee: and Israel will be strengthened and will sit upon the rod.
{48:3} And Jacob will say to Joseph, God Almighty was seen to me in Luz in the land of Canaan, and he will bless me.
{48:4} And he will say to me, Behold, I making thee fruitful, and I multiplied thee, and I gave thee for an assembly of people; and I gave this land to thy seed after thee a possession forever.
{48:5} And now, thy two sons having been born to thee in the land of Egypt, before I came to thee to Egypt, they are to me: Ephraim and Manasseh shall be to me as Reuben and Simeon.
{48:6} And thy progeny which thou didst beget after them, shall be to thee; after the name of their brethren shall they be called in their inheritance.
{48:7} And I in my coming from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan, in the way, in yet a length of land to go to Ephrath: and I shall bury her there in the way of Ephrath; this the house of bread.
{48:8} And Israel will see Joseph's sons, and will say, Who are these?
{48:9} And Joseph will say to his father, They are my sons which God gave me here. And he will say, Bring them now to me, and I will bless them.
{48:10} And the eyes of Israel were heavy from old age; he will not be able to see; and he will draw them near to him, and he will kiss them, and embrace them.
{48:11} And Israel will say to Joseph, To see thy face I thought not; and behold, God caused me to see also thy seed.
{48:12} And Joseph will bring them forth from his knees, and will bow himself with his face to the earth.
{48:13} And Joseph will take the two, Ephraim in his right hand from Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand from Israel's right hand, and will draw near to him.
{48:14} And Israel will put forth his right hand, and will place upon Ephraim's head, and he the small; and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, attending to his hands wisely; for Manasseh was the first-born.
{48:15} And he will bless Joseph, and will say, God, before whom my fathers went, Abraham and Isaak, the God having fed me, from ever since I was till this day.
{48:16} The messenger redeeming me from all evil, shall bless the youths; and my name shall be called upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaak and they shall be increased into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
{48:17} And Joseph will see that his father will put his right hand upon Ephraim's head, and it will be evil in his eyes: and he will take hold of his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
{48:18} And Joseph will say to his father, Not so, my father: for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.
{48:19} And his father will refuse and will say, I knew my son, I knew: this also shall be into a people, and this also shall be great: and yet his brother the small, shall be great more than he, and his seed shall be a fulness of nations.
{48:20} And he will bless them in that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, Will God set thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he will set Ephraim before Manasseh.
{48:21} And Israel will say to Joseph, I am dying: and God was with you and turned you back to the land of your fathers.
{48:22} And I gave to thee one shoulder over thy brethren, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
{49:1} And Jacob will call to his sons, and will say, Be ye gathered together, and I will announce to you what shall happen to you in the last part of the days.
{49:2} Be gathered together, and hear ye sons of Jacob, and hear to Israel your father.
{49:3} Reuben, my first-born, thou my strength, and the beginning of my strength, the abundance of elevation, and the abundance of might.
{49:4} Vain glorious as water, thou shalt not be preeminent; for thou didst go up out of thy father's bed; then didst thou defile, going up to my couch.
{49:5} Simon and Levi brethren; their swords instruments of violence.
{49:6} My soul shall not come into their consultation; in their assembly, my honor shall not be united, for in their anger they killed a man and in their will, houghed a bullock.
{49:7} Cursed their anger, for it was hard; and their wrath, for it was hardened: I will divide them in Jacob, and I will disperse them in Israel.
{49:8} Judah, thee, thee shall thy brethren praise; thy hand upon the back of thine enemies; thy father's sons shall worship before thee.
{49:9} Judah, a lion's whelp; from the green leaf, my son, thou didst go up: bending, lying down, as a lion, and as a lioness: who shall raise him up?
{49:10} The rod shall not depart from Judah, and a leader from between his feet, till that Shiloh shall come: and to him the obedience of the nations.
{49:11} Binding his colt to the vine, and to the purple vine the son of the she-ass; he washed in wine his garment, and his clothing in the blood of grapes.
{49:12} The eyes flashing from wine, the teeth white from milk.
{49:13} Zebulon shall dwell by the coast of the sea; and he by a coast of ships, and the extremities, even to Zidon.
{49:14} Issachar, an ass; a heap of bone lying down in the midst of the tribes.
{49:15} And he will see the rest that it was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and he extended his shoulder to bear, and he will be a servant to tribute.
{49:16} Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.
{49:17} Dan shall be a serpent upon the way, creeping upon the path, biting the heels of the horse and his beast for riding shall fall behind.
{49:18} I waited for thy deliverance, Jehovah.
{49:19} Gad, a troop, shall press upon him; and this shall press upon the heel.
{49:20} From Asher his bread, fat, and he will give the dainties of a king.
{49:21} Naphtali a mighty shoot, giving fair words.
{49:22} Joseph a fruitful son, a fruitful son upon a fountain, the daughters mounting over a wall.
{49:23} This adversary will embitter him, and the lords of the arrows will lie in wait.
{49:24} And his bow will dwell in strength, and the seed of his hands will be firm by the hands of the mighty one of Jacob; from whence the shepherd, the stone of Israel.
{49:25} By the God of thy father, and he will help thee, and by the Almighty, and he will bless thee with the blessing of the heavens above, the blessing of the sea lying under, the blessing of the breasts and the womb.
{49:26} The blessings of thy father were strong above the blessings of the everlasting mountains; the delight of the eternal hills, they shall be upon the head of Joseph and upon the crown of the head of him separated from his brethren.
{49:27} Benjamin, a Wolf, tearing in pieces; in the morning will he eat the prey, and at evening he will divide the prey.
{49:28} All these tribes of Israel, twelve: and this what their father spake to them, and he will bless them; each according to his blessing he blessed them.
{49:29} And he will command them, and will say to them, I am added to my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave which is in the field of Ephron the Hittite.
{49:30} In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamra in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite, for the possession of a grave.
{49:31} There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaak and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.
{49:32} The possession of the field and the cave which is in it, from the sons of Heth.
{49:33} And Jacob will finish to command his sons, and he will gather his feet to the bed, and will expire, and will be gathered to his people.
{50:1} And Joseph will fall upon his father's face, and will weep over him and he will kiss him.
{50:2} And Joseph will command his servants the physicians, to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
{50:3} And they will fill up forty days for him: for so will they fill up the days of the embalmed: and the Egyptians will weep for him seventy days.
{50:4} And the days of his weeping will pass over, and Joseph will speak to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I found grace in thine eyes, speak now in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
{50:5} My father caused me to swear, saying, Behold I am dying: in my grave which I dug for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. And at this time will I now go up and bury my father, and I will turn back.
{50:6} And Pharaoh will say, Go up and bury thy father, according to what he caused thee to swear.
{50:7} And Joseph will go up to bury his father; and all the servants of Pharaoh will go up with him, the old men of his house, and all the old men of the land of Egypt.
{50:8} And all the house of Joseph and his brethren, and the house of his father: only their little ones and their sheep and their oxen they left in the land of Goshen.
{50:9} And also will go up with him chariot, also horseman; and there will be a very great camp.
{50:10} And they will come to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and they will mourn there a mourning great and strong exceedingly: and he will make for his father a mourning, seven days.
{50:11} And the Canaanites dwelling in the land will see the mourning in the threshing-floor of Atad, and they will say, A great mourning this to the Egyptians; for this its name was called, the Mourning of the Egyptians, which is beyond Jordan.
{50:12} And his sons will do to him thus according to what he commanded them.
{50:13} And his sons will take him up to the land of Cannon, and they will bury him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for the possession of a grave, from Ephron the Hittites before Mamra.
{50:14} And Joseph will turn back to Egypt, he and his brethren and all going up with him, to bury his father, after they buried his father.
{50:15} And Joseph's brethren will see that their father died, and they will say to him, Joseph will lie in wait for us, and turning back, will turn back to us all the evil which we did to him.
{50:16} And they will come forth to Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before his death, saying,
{50:17} So shall ye say to Joseph, I pray thee now take away the trespass of thy brethren and their sin; for they did to thee evil: and at this time now take away upon the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph will weep in their speaking to him.
{50:18} And they will come and will fall down before him, and they will say, Behold, we are for servants to thee.
{50:19} And Joseph will say to them, Ye shall not fear, for I am for God.
{50:20} And you, ye even purposed evil against me; God purposed it for good, for the sake of doing as this day, to preserve alive much people.
{50:21} And now ye shall not fear: I will give you to eat, and your little ones. And he will comfort them, and will speak to their hearts.
{50:22} And Joseph will dwell in Egypt, he and the house of his father: and Joseph will live a hundred and ten years.
{50:23} And Joseph will see sons to Ephraim of the third generation; also the sons of Machir, son of Manasseh, were brought forth upon Joseph's knees.
{50:24} And Joseph will say to his brethren, I am dying; and God reviewing, will review you, and will bring you up from this land to the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaak and to Jacob.
{50:25} And Joseph will cause the sons of Israel to swear, saying, God reviewing, will review you and bring ye up my bones from here.
{50:26} And Joseph will die, the son of a hundred and ten years; and they will embalm him and will put in an ark in Egypt.
