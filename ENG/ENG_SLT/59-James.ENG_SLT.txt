{1:1} James, servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the dispersion, health.
{1:2} Deem all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into various trials;
{1:3} Knowing that the proof of your faith works patience.
{1:4} And let patience have a perfect work, that ye be perfect and entire, being left behind in nothing.
{1:5} If any of you is forsaken of wisdom, let him ask of God, giving to all plainly, blaming not; and it shall be given him.
{1:6} And let him ask in faith, being at variance in nothing. For he being at variance is like the surge of the sea being moved by the wind and put in motion.
{1:7} For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
{1:8} A man divided in opinion unsteady in all his ways.
{1:9} And let the humble brother boast in his elevation:
{1:10} And the rich, in his humiliation: for as the flower of the grass he shall pass by.
{1:11} For the sun sprang up with heat, and dried up the grass, and its flower fell out, and the decorum of its face was destroyed: so also shall the rich be dried up in his goings.
{1:12} Happy the man who endures temptation: for being tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them loving him.
{1:13} Let none say being tempted, that I am tempted of God: for God is not tempted of evils, and he tempts none:
{1:14} And each is tempted from his own lust, being drawn out, and decoyed.
{1:15} So then lust conceiving, brings forth sin: and sin performed, produces death.
{1:16} Be not led astray, my dearly beloved brethren.
{1:17} Every good donation and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom not one change, or shadow of turning.
{1:18} Having willed he brought forth by the word of truth, for us to be some first fruit of his creatures.
{1:19} Wherefore, my dearly beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger:
{1:20} For man s anger works not the justice of God.
{1:21} Wherefore having put away all sordid avarice, and excess of wickedness, in meekness receive the implanted word, able to save your souls.
{1:22} And be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
{1:23} For if any is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man observing the face of his creation in a mirror:
{1:24} For he observed himself, and went away, and straightway forgot of what kind he was.
{1:25} And he having stooped into the perfect law of liberty, and remained, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of work, he shall be happy in his doing.
{1:26} If any among you seem to be religious, bridling not his tongue, but deceiving his heart, the religion of this one vain.
{1:27} Religion pure and unpolluted before God and the Father is this, To take a view of the orphans and widows in their pressure, to keep himself free from stain from the world.
{2:1} My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, of glory, with distinction of faces.
{2:2} For if there come into your synagogue a man wearing gold rings on is fingers, in brilliant clothing, and there come in also a beggar in filthy clothing;
{2:3} And ye look toward him bearing the brilliant clothing, and ye say to him, Sit thou well here; and to the beggar ye say, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
{2:4} Were ye not separated among yourselves, and become judges of evil reflections?
{2:5} Hear, my dearly beloved brethren, Has not God chosen the beggars of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them loving him?
{2:6} And ye have despised the beggar. Do not the rich bring you into subjection, and draw you before tribunals?
{2:7} And do they not defame the good name called upon you?
{2:8} If yet ye complete the royal law according to the writing, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:
{2:9} And if ye make distinction of faces, ye work sin, being convicted under the law as transgressors.
{2:10} For whoever shall keep the whole law, and stumble in one, has become bound of all.
{2:11} For he having said, Thou shouldest not commit adultery, said also, Thou shouldest not kill: and if thou commit not adultery, and dost kill, thou hast become a transgressor of the law.
{2:12} So speak ye, and so do, as about to be judged by the law of liberty.
{2:13} For unpropitiated judgment to him not doing mercy; and mercy boasteth against judgment.
{2:14} And what profit, my brethren, if any say he has faith, and should not have works? can faith save him?
{2:15} And if a brother or sister be naked, and be failing of daily food,
{2:16} And any of you say to them, Retire in peace, be ye warmed and be ye fed; and ye give them not things fitting the body; what profit?
{2:17} So also faith, if it have not works, is dead by itself.
{2:18} But certain will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith from my works.
{2:19} Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: and the evil spirits believe, and shudder.
{2:20} And wilt thou know, O empty man, that faith without works is dead?
{2:21} Was not Abraham our father justified by works, having brought up Isaac his son upon the altar.
{2:22} Thou seest that faith cooperated with his works, and from works was faith perfected.
{2:23} And the writing was completed, saying, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for justice: and he was called the Friend of God.
{2:24} Therefore ye see that man is justified from works, and not from faith alone.
{2:25} And likewise also was not Rehab the harlot justified by works, having received the messengers, and cast out by another way?
{2:26} For as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.
{3:1} Be ye not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive the greater judgment.
{3:2} For in many things we all stumble. If any stumble not in word, this a perfect man, able to govern by a bridle also the whole body.
{3:3} Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they should yield to us; and we lead their whole body.
{3:4} Behold also ships, being so great, and driven by hard winds, are led by the smallest rudder, wherever the desire of him steering should will.
{3:5} So also the tongue is a small member, and vaunts itself. Behold, how great a wood a little fire inflames.
{3:6} (And the tongue a fire, a world of iniquity: so the tongue is placed in our members, defiling the whole body, and burning the wheel of creation; and burned by hell.
{3:7} For every nature of beasts, and also of birds, of creeping things, and also of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by the nature of man:
{3:8} And the tongue none of men can tame; an ungovernable evil, full of deadly poison.
{3:9} With it we praise the God and Father; and with it we curse men, those made according to the similitude of God.
{3:10} Out of the same month comes forth blessing and cursing. There is no need, my brethren, for these things so to be.
{3:11} Much less from the same aperture does a fountain bubble out sweet and bitter?
{3:12} The fig tree, my brethren, cannot make olives, or the vine, figs: so no fountain can make salt and sweet water.
{3:13} Who wise and knowing among you? let him show out of a good mode of life his works in meekness of wisdom.
{3:14} And if ye have bitter envy and intrigue in your heart, boast not, and lie not against the truth.
{3:15} This is wisdom coming not down from above, but earthly, natural, resembling an evil spirit.
{3:16} For where envy and intrigue, there confusion and every bad deed.
{3:17} And the wisdom from above is truly first pure, then peaceful, decorous, docile, full of mercy and good fruits, not separated, and unfeigned.
{3:18} And the fruit of justice is sown in peace by those making peace.
{4:1} Whence wars and fights among you? are they not hence, out of your sensual pleasures making war in your members.
{4:2} Ye eagerly desire, and have not: ye kill, and are zealous, and cannot succeed: ye fight and wage war, and ye have not, because ye ask not.
{4:3} Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask wickedly that ye might expend upon your sensual pleasures.
{4:4} Adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is the enmity of God? whoever therefore would wish to be the friend of the world is set the enemy of God.
{4:5} Or think ye that the writing says vainly, That the spirit longs for envy, which dwelt in us?
{4:6} And he gives greater grace. Wherefore he says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
{4:7} Be subjected therefore to God. Resist the accuser, and he will flee from you.
{4:8} Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse the hands, ye sinful; and purify the hearts, ye double souled.
{4:9} Toil, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and joy to dejection.
{4:10} Be ye humbled before the Lord, and he will lift you up.
{4:11} Speak not against one another, brethren. He speaking against a brother, and judging his brother, speaks against the law, and judges the law: and if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
{4:12} There is one legislator, able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another.
{4:13} Come on now, ye saying, To day or to morrow let us go to this city, and do there one year, and let us trade, and derive profit:
{4:14} (Which know not that of the morrow. For what your life? For it is a steam, appearing for a little, and then invisible.)
{4:15} For you should say, If the Lord will, and we live, and should do this, or that.
{4:16} And now ye boast in your arrogance: all such boasting is evil.
{4:17} Therefore to him knowing to do good, and not doing, to him it is sin.
{5:1} Come on now, ye rich, weep, uttering loud cries of grief for the misfortunes coming upon you.
{5:2} Your riches have become corrupted, and your garments have been moth eaten;
{5:3} Your gold and silver is become rusty; and their rust shall be for a witness to you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye have gathered up treasures in the last days.
{5:4} Behold, the hire of laborers having reaped your farms, withheld by you, cries out, and the cries of the reapers have entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.
{5:5} Ye have led a luxurious life upon the earth, and have rioted in luxury; ye have nourished your hearts, as in the day of slaughter.
{5:6} Ye have condemned, ye have killed the just one; and he resists you not.
{5:7} Therefore be longsuffering, brethren, even to the arrival of the Lord. Behold, the farmer awaits the precious fruit of the earth, being longsuffering for it, even till he should receive the early and late rain.
{5:8} Be longsuffering, ye also; make your hearts firm: for the arrival of the Lord has drawn near.
{5:9} Groan not against one another, brethren, that ye be not condemned: behold, the judge stands before the door.
{5:10} Take a pattern of affliction, my brethren, and of longsuffering, the prophets, who spake in the name of the Lord.
{5:11} Behold, we esteem those enduring happy. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and ye see the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful.
{5:12} And before all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by earth, nor any other oath: and let your yea be yea; and nay, nay; that ye fall not under judgment.
{5:13} Does any suffer among you? let him pray. Is any cheerful? let him play on the harp.
{5:14} Is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil in the name of the Lord:
{5:15} And the prayer of faith shall save him being sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he should have wrought sins, it shall be remitted to him.
{5:16} Acknowledge your faults to one another, and pray for one another, that ye might be healed. The prayer of the just, being energetic, is very powerful.
{5:17} Elias was a man having similar feelings with us, and in prayer he prayed for it not to rain: and it rained not upon the earth for three years and six months.
{5:18} And again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth shot forth her fruit.
{5:19} Brethren, if any among you be led astray from the truth, and any should turn him back;
{5:20} Let him know, that he having turned the sinful from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.
