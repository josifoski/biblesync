{1:1} In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word.
{1:2} This was in the beginning with God.
{1:3} All things were by him; and without him out him was not one thing that was.
{1:4} In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
{1:5} And light shines in darkness; and darkness comprehended it not.
{1:6} A man was sent from God, the name to him John.
{1:7} This came for testimony, that he might testify concerning the Light, that all might believe through him.
{1:8} He was not that Light, but that he might testify for the Light.
{1:9} The Light was true, which enlightens every man coming into the world.
{1:10} He was in the world, and the world was by him, and the world knew him not.
{1:11} He came to his own things, and his own received him not.
{1:12} And as many as received him, he gave them authority to be the children of God, to them believing on his name:
{1:13} They were not born of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
{1:14} And the Word was flesh, and dwelt with us, (and we beheld his glory, as the glory of the only born of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
{1:15} John testifies for him, and he tried, saying, This was he of whom I said, He coming after me was before me: for he was before me.
{1:16} And of his completion we all received, and grace for grace.
{1:17} For the law was given by Moses; grace and truth were by Jesus Christ.
{1:18} None has seen God at any time; the only born Son, he being in the bosom of the Father, he has declared.
{1:19} And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem that they might ask him, Who art thou?
{1:20} And he acknowledged, and denied not; and he acknowledged, That I am not the Christ.
{1:21} And they asked, What then? Art thou Elias? And he says, I am not. Art thou a prophet? And he answered, No.
{1:22} Then said they to him, Who art thou? that we might give answer to them having sent us. What sayest thou for thyself?
{1:23} He said, I the voice of him crying in the desert, Make ye straight the way of the Lord, as said Esaias the prophet.
{1:24} And they having been sent were of the Pharisees.
{1:25} And they asked him, and said to him, Why immersest thou then, if thou art not Christ, neither Elias, neither a prophet?
{1:26} John answered them saying, I immerse in water: but he stands the midst of you, whom ye know not;
{1:27} This is he coming after me, who was before me, of whom I am not worthy that I might loose the strings of his shoes.
{1:28} These things were in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was immersing.
{1:29} In the morrow John sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, be taking away the sin of the world.
{1:30} This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who was before me: for he was before me.
{1:31} And I knew him not: but that he might be manifested to Israel, for this I came immersing in water.
{1:32} And John testified, saying, That I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it remained up on him.
{1:33} And I knew him not: but he having sent me to immerse in water, this said to me, Upon whomsoever thou shouldest see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon him, this is he immersing in the Holy Spirit.
{1:34} And I have seen, and testified that this is the Son of God.
{1:35} Again on the morrow John stood, and two of his disciples;
{1:36} And having looked upon Jesus walking, he says, Behold the Lamb of God.
{1:37} And two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus.
{1:38} And Jesus having turned, and seen them following, says to them, What seek ye? They said to him, Rabbi, (It says, being interpreted, Teacher,) where remainest thou.
{1:39} He says to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he remains, and they remained with him that day: and it was about the tenth hour.
{1:40} It was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, one of the two having heard of John, and followed him.
{1:41} He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found Messias, which is, being interpreted, Christ.
{1:42} And he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus having looked upon him, said, Thou art Simon son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is, interpreted, Peter.
{1:43} The morrow Jesus wished to go forth to Galilee, and he finds Philip, and he says to him, Follow me.
{1:44} And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
{1:45} And Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, we have found, Jesus, son of Joseph, him from Nazareth.
{1:46} And Nathanael said to him, Can any good be from Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.
{1:47} Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and he says of him, Behold truly an Israelite, in whom is no deceit!
{1:48} Nathanael says to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, being under the fig tree, I saw thee.
{1:49} Nathanael answers and says to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
{1:50} Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou thou shalt see greater than these.
{1:51} And he says to him, Amen, amen, I say to you, From henceforth shall ye see heaven opened, and the messengers of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
{2:1} And the third day was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
{2:2} And Jesus was also called, and his disciples, to the wedding.
{2:3} And wine having failed, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine.
{2:4} And Jesus says to her, What to me and thee, woman mine hour comes not yet.
{2:5} His mother says to the servants, Whatever he says to you, do.
{2:6} And six stone water buckets were placed there, according to the purification of the Jews, containing each two or three measures.
{2:7} Jesus says to them, Fill the water buckets with water. And they filled them even up over.
{2:8} And he says to them, Draw now, and carry to the superintendent of the feast. And they carried.
{2:9} And when the superintendent of the feast tasted the wine having been water, and knew not whence it is: (and the servants knew, having drawn the water;) the superintendent calls the bridegroom,
{2:10} And says to him, Every man sets good wine first; and when they be intoxicated, then inferior: thou hast kept the good wine till now.
{2:11} This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
{2:12} After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they remained there not many days.
{2:13} And the pascha of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
{2:14} And found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and money-changers sitting;
{2:15} And having made a scourge of ropes, he cast all out of the temple, also sheep, and oxen; and poured out the small coin of money-changers, and overturned the tables;
{2:16} And he said to those selling doves, Take away these things hence; make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise.
{2:17} And his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thine house has eaten me up.
{2:18} Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign shewest thou, that thou doest these things?
{2:19} Jesus answered and said to them, Loose this temple, and in three days will I raise it up.
{2:20} Then said the Jews, In forty-six years was this temple built, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?
{2:21} But he spake concerning the temple of his body.
{2:22} When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this to them; and they believed the writing, and the word which Jesus spake.
{2:23} And when he was in Jerusalem at the pascha, in the festival, many believed in his name, beholding his signs which he did.
{2:24} And Jesus himself trusted not himself to them, for he knew all,
{2:25} For also he had no need that any should testify concerning man: for he knew what was in man.
{3:1} And there was a man of the Pharisees, Nicodemus the name to him, a ruler of the Jews:
{3:2} He came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou hast come a teacher from God: for none can do these signs which thou doest, except God be with him.
{3:3} Jesus answered and said to him, Amen, amen, I say to thee, Except any one be born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
{3:4} Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be born, being an old man? he cannot come in a second time to his mother's belly, and be born.
{3:5} Jesus says to him, Truly, truly, I say to thee, Except any one be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot come into the kingdom of God.
{3:6} That born of flesh is flesh; and that born of the Spirit is spirit.
{3:7} Thou shouldest not wonder that I said to thee, Ye must be born from above.
{3:8} The wind, where it wills, blows, and its voice thou hearest, but thou knowest not whence it comes, and where it goes: so is every one having been born of the Spirit.
{3:9} Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?
{3:10} Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these?
{3:11} Truly, truly, I say to thee, that what we know, we speak, and what we have seen we testify; and ye receive not our testimony.
{3:12} If I spake to you earthly things, and ye believe not, how, if I speak to you heavenly things, will ye believe.
{3:13} And none has ascended to heaven, except he having descended from heaven, the Son of man, he being in heaven.
{3:14} And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man be lifted up;
{3:15} That every one believing in him perish not, but have eternal life.
{3:16} For God so loved the world, that he gave his only born Son, that every one believing in him perish not, but have eternal life.
{3:17} For God sent not his Son into the world that he judge the world; but that the world might be saved through him.
{3:18} He believing in him is not judged: and he not believing has been already judged, because he has not believed in the name of the only born Son of God.
{3:19} And this is the judgment, that light has come into the world, and men rather loved darkness than light, for their works were evil.
{3:20} For every one doing bad things hates the light, and he comes not to the light, lest his works should be rebuked.
{3:21} But he doing the truth comes to the light, that his works might be manifested, that they are wrought in God.
{3:22} After these Jesus came and his disciples into the Judean land; and there he tarried with them, and immersed.
{3:23} And John was also immersing in Aenon near Salim, for many waters were there: and they came near and were immersed.
{3:24} For John was not yet cast into prison.
{3:25} Then was there an investigation of John's disciples with Jesus about purification.
{3:26} And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou hast testified, behold, he immerses, and all come to him.
{3:27} John answered and said, No man can receive anything except it be given him from heaven.
{3:28} Ye yourselves testify to me, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
{3:29} He having the bride is the bridegroom: and the friend of the bridegroom, standing and hearing him, rejoices with joy for the bridegroom's voice: therefore this my joy has been completed.
{3:30} He must increase, and I must be diminished.
{3:31} He coming from above is above all, he being of the earth is of earth, and speaks of earth: he coming from heaven is above all.
{3:32} And what he saw and heard, this be testifies: and none receives his testimony.
{3:33} He having received his testimony has fixed a seal that God is true.
{3:34} For he whom God sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure.
{3:35} The Father loves the Son, and he has given all things into his hand.
{3:36} He believing in the Son has eternal life: and he not believing the Son shall not see life, but the anger of God remains upon him.
{4:1} Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus makes and baptizes more disciples than John,
{4:2} (Though Jesus himself immersed not, but his disciples,)
{4:3} He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.
{4:4} And it was necessary for him to pass through Samaria.
{4:5} Then comes he to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the place which Jacob gave to Joseph his son.
{4:6} And Jacob's spring was there. Then Jesus, wearied with the journey, sat thus by the spring: it was about the sixth hour.
{4:7} A woman of Samaria comes to draw water: Jesus says to her, Give me to drink.
{4:8} (For his disciples were gone into the city that they might buy food.)
{4:9} Then says the Samaritan woman to him, How thou, being a Jew, askest of me to drink, being a Samaritan woman? for the Jews have no intercourse with the Samaritans.
{4:10} And Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who he is saying to thee, Give me to drink: thou hadst asked him, and he had given thee living water.
{4:11} The woman says to him, Lord, thou hast no vessel for drawing, and the well is deep; whence then hast thou the living water?
{4:12} Thou art not greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and he himself drank of it, and his sons, and his young animals.
{4:13} Jesus answered and said to her, All drinking of this water shall thirst again:
{4:14} But whoever should drink of the water which I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water which I shall give him shall be in him a spring of water springing up to eternal life.
{4:15} The woman says to him, Lord, give me this water, that I thirst not, nor come here to draw.
{4:16} Jesus says to her, Retire, call thy husband, and come here.
{4:17} The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus says to her, Thou sayest well, That I have no husband:
{4:18} For thou hadst five husbands; and now he whom thou hast is not thy husband: this thou saidst true.
{4:19} The woman says to him, Lord, I see that thou art a prophet.
{4:20} Our fathers worshipped in this mount; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where they must worship.
{4:21} Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, that the hour comes, when neither in this mount, neither in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.
{4:22} Ye worship what ye know not: we worship what we know: for salvation is of the Jews.
{4:23} But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such worshipping him.
{4:24} God a Spirit: and they worshipping him must worship in spirit and truth.
{4:25} The woman says to him, I know that Messias comes, called Christ: when he should come, he will announce all things to us.
{4:26} Jesus says to her, I am he speaking to thee.
{4:27} And upon this his disciples came, and they wondered that he spake with the woman: yet none said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?
{4:28} The woman then left her water buckets and departed to the city, and says to the men,
{4:29} Come, see a man, who told me all which I ever did: is not this Christ?
{4:30} Then went they forth out of the city, and came to him.
{4:31} And in the mean time the disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
{4:32} And he said to them, I have food to eat which ye know not.
{4:33} Then said the disciples to one another, Has any one brought him to eat?
{4:34} Jesus says to them, My food is that I might do the will of him having sent me, and finish his work.
{4:35} Say ye not, That there is yet the fourth month, and harvest comes? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and behold the countries; for they are already white for harvest.
{4:36} And he reaping receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life: that he sowing might rejoice together and he reaping.
{4:37} For in this the word is true, That one is sowing, and another reaping.
{4:38} I sent you to reap that with which ye have not been wearied: some have been wearied, and others have come into their labor.
{4:39} And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him for the woman's word testifying, That he told me all which I ever did.
{4:40} When therefore the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to remain with them: and he remained there two days.
{4:41} And many more believed on account of his word;
{4:42} And they said to the woman, That we no more believe for thy speaking: for we ourselves have heard and know, that this is truly Christ, the Saviour of the world.
{4:43} And after two days he came out thence, and departed to Galilee.
{4:44} For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honour in his own country.
{4:45} When therefore he came to Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all which he did in Jerusalem in the festival: for they also came to the festival.
{4:46} Then came Jesus again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain royal one, whose son was sick in Capernaum.
{4:47} He, having heard that Jesus was come from Judea to Galilee, went away to him, and asked him that he would go down and heal his son: for he was about to die.
{4:48} Then said Jesus to him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye would not believe.
{4:49} The royal one says to Him, Lord, go down before my child dies.
{4:50} Jesus says to him, Go; thy son lives. And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and he went.
{4:51} And he already going down, his servants met him, and announced, saying, That thy child lives.
{4:52} Then he inquired of them the hour in which he was attended to. And they said to him, That yesterday the seventh hour the fever left him.
{4:53} Then the father knew that in that hour in which Jesus said to him, That thy son lives: and he believed, and his whole house.
{4:54} This second sign Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.
{5:1} After these was the festival of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
{5:2} And there is in Jerusalem, at the sheep place a pool, in Hebrew called Bethesda, having five porches.
{5:3} In these lay a great multitude of weak, blind, lame, withered, expecting the moving of the water.
{5:4} For a messenger at a time went down into the pool, and troubled the water: then he having first stepped in after the troubling of the water became healthy, by whatever malady a long while since he was laid.
{5:5} And a certain man was there, being in weakness thirty-eight years.
{5:6} Jesus having seen the same lying down, and having known that it was already much time, says to him, Wilt thou be well?
{5:7} He being sick answered him, Lord, I have no man, that, when the water was troubled, he might cast me into the pool: and in which I am coming, another steps down before me.
{5:8} Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy couch, and walk.
{5:9} And quickly the man was well, and he took up his couch, and walked: and the sabbath was in that day.
{5:10} Then said the Jews to him healed, It is the sabbath: it is not lawful for thee to take up thy couch.
{5:11} He answered them, He having made me well, the same said to me, Lift up thy couch, and walk.
{5:12} Then they asked him, Who is the man having said to thee, Lift up thy couch, and walk?
{5:13} And he healed knew not who he is: for Jesus escaped, a crowd being in the place.
{5:14} After these, Jesus finds him in the temple, and he said to him, Behold, thou hast become well: sin no more, lest something worse be to thee.
{5:15} The man departed, and announced to the Jews that it is Jesus having made him well.
{5:16} And therefore the Jews drove out Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these in the sabbath.
{5:17} And Jesus answered, My Father works till now, and I work.
{5:18} For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, for not only did he loose the sabbath, but also he called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.
{5:19} Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can of himself do nothing, except what he sees the Father doing: for whatever he should do, also these does the Son likewise.
{5:20} For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all which himself does: and he will show him greater than these, that ye might wonder.
{5:21} For as the Father arouses the dead, and makes alive; so also the Son makes alive whom he will.
{5:22} For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son:
{5:23} That all should honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He honouring not the Son, honours not the Father having sent him.
{5:24} Truly, truly, I say to you, That he hearing my word, and believing him having sent me, has eternal life, and comes not into judgment; but has passed from death to life.
{5:25} Truly, truly, I say to you, That the hour comes, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they hearing shall live.
{5:26} For as the Father has life in himself, so also gave he to the Son to have life in himself;
{5:27} And gave him authority also to do judgment, because he is the Son of man.
{5:28} Wonder not at this: for the hour comes, in which all they in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall go forth;
{5:29} They having done good, to rising up of life; and they having done bad, to rising up of judgment.
{5:30} I can do nothing of myself: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; for I seek not my will, but the will of the Father having sent me.
{5:31} If I testify of myself, my testimony is not true.
{5:32} Another is testifying of me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies of me is true.
{5:33} Ye have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.
{5:34} But I receive not testimony from man: but these I say that ye might be saved.
{5:35} He was a burning and manifest light: and ye wished to rejoice for a time in his light.
{5:36} And I have greater testimony than of John: for the works that the Father gave me that I might finish them, the same works that I do, testify of me, that the Father has sent me.
{5:37} And the Father having sent me, he has testified of me. Nor have ye at any time heard his voice, or seen his form.
{5:38} And his word ye have not remaining in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not.
{5:39} Search the writings; for ye think in them to have eternal life: and these are they testifying of me.
{5:40} And ye wish not to come to me, that ye might have life.
{5:41} I receive not glory from man.
{5:42} But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
{5:43} I have come in the name of my Father, and ye receive me not: if another should come in his own name, him will ye receive.
{5:44} How can ye believe, receiving glory from one another, and ye seek not the glory that from God alone?
{5:45} Think not that I shall accuse you to the Father: he accusing you is Moses, in whom ye have hoped.
{5:46} For if ye had believed Moses, ye had believed me: for he himself wrote of me.
{5:47} And if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
{6:1} After these Jesus departed beyond the sea of Galilee, of Tiberias.
{6:2} And a great crowd followed him, for they saw his signs which he did upon the sick.
{6:3} And Jesus went up into the mount, and sat there with his disciples.
{6:4} And the pascha was near, the festival of the Jews.
{6:5} Then Jesus having lifted up the eyes, and seen that a great crowd comes to him, says to Philip, Whence shall we buy loaves that these might eat?
{6:6} And this he said trying him: for himself knew what he was about to do.
{6:7} Philip answered him. Loaves of two hundred drachmas will not suffice them, that each of them should take some little.
{6:8} One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says to him,
{6:9} There is one little boy here, who has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are these among so many?
{6:10} And Jesus said, Make the men recline. And there was much grass in the place. Then the men reclined, the number about five thousand.
{6:11} And Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, distributed to his disciples, and the disciples to the reclining; and likewise of the small fishes, as many as they wished.
{6:12} And when they were filled, he says to his disciples, Gather the fragments remaining over, that nothing should be lost.
{6:13} Then gathered they, and filled twelve baskets of the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over to them having eaten.
{6:14} Then the men, having seen the sign which Jesus did, said, That this is truly the prophet coming into the world.
{6:15} Then Jesus having known that they were about to come and carry him of forcibly, that they might make him king, departed again to the mount alone.
{6:16} And when it was evening, his disciples went down to the sea.
{6:17} And having entered into a ship, they came beyond the sea to Capernaum. And already was there darkness, and Jesus had not come to them.
{6:18} And the sea, a great wind blowing, arose.
{6:19} Then having urged forward about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they behold Jesus walking upon the sea, and being near the ship: and they were afraid.
{6:20} And he says to them, I am; be not afraid.
{6:21} Then they wished to take him into the ship: and the ship was quickly at land to which they retired.
{6:22} The morrow, the crowd standing beyond the sea having seen that no other small vessel was there, except that one into which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the small vessel, but his disciples departed alone;
{6:23} (But also other small vessels came out of Tiberias near to the place where they ate bread, the Lord having returned thanks:)
{6:24} When the crowd therefore saw that Jesus is not there, nor his disciples, they also entered into ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
{6:25} And having found them beyond the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou here?
{6:26} Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but for that ye ate of the loaves, and were satisfied.
{6:27} Work not for food perishing, but food remaining to eternal life, which the Son of man will give you: for him God the Father sealed.
{6:28} Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?
{6:29} Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye should believe in him whom he has sent.
{6:30} Then said they to him, What sign doest thou, that we might see, and believe thee? what workest thou?
{6:31} Our fathers ate manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
{6:32} Then said Jesus to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you bread from heaven; but my Father gives you true bread from heaven.
{6:33} For the bread of God is he coming down from heaven, and giving life to the world.
{6:34} Then said they to him, Lord, always give us this bread.
{6:35} And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he coming to me should not hunger; and he believing in me should not thirst.
{6:36} But I said to you, That ye have seen me, and believe not.
{6:37} All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and he coming to me I will not cast out.
{6:38} For I have come down from heaven, not that I might do my will, but the will of him having sent me.
{6:39} And this is the will of the Father having sent me, that all which he has given me, I should not loose of it, but raise it up in the last day.
{6:40} And this is the will of him having sent me, that every one seeing the Son, and believing in him, should have eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
{6:41} Then murmured the Jews about him, because he said, I am the bread having come down from heaven.
{6:42} And they said, Is not this Jesus, Joseph's son, whose father and mother we know? how then says he, That I have come down from heaven?
{6:43} Then answered Jesus and said to them, Murmur not with one another.
{6:44} None can come to me, except the Father having sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
{6:45} It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every one therefore having heard and learned of the Father, comes to me.
{6:46} Not that any one has seen the Father, except he being from God, he has seen the Father.
{6:47} Truly, truly, I say to you, he believing in me has eternal life.
{6:48} I am the bread of life.
{6:49} Your fathers ate manna in the desert, and died.
{6:50} This is the bread which coming down from heaven, that whoever should eat of it, and he should not die.
{6:51} I am the living bread which having come down from heaven: if any one eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and also the bread which I shall give is my flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.
{6:52} Then the Jews contended with one another, saying, How can he give us the flesh to eat.
{6:53} Then said Jesus to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in yourselves.
{6:54} He chewing my flesh, and drinking my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
{6:55} For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink.
{6:56} He chewing my flesh, and drinking my blood, remains in me, and I in him.
{6:57} As the living Father sent me, and I live through the Father: also he chewing me, the same also shall live through me.
{6:58} This is the bread which having come down from heaven: not as your fathers ate manna, and died: he chewing this bread shall live forever.
{6:59} He said these, teaching in the synagogue, in Capernaum.
{6:60} Then many of his disciples, having heard, said, This is a hard word; who can hear it.
{6:61} And Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmur for this, said to them, Does this offend you?
{6:62} If then ye see the Son of man going up where he was before.
{6:63} It is the spirit making alive; the flesh profits nothing: the words which I speak to you are spirit, and are life.
{6:64} But there are some of you who believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they are not believing, and who he is going to deliver him up.
{6:65} And he said, Therefore have I said to you, that no one can come to me, except it be given him of my Father.
{6:66} From this many of his disciples went away back, and walked no more with him.
{6:67} Then said Jesus to the twelve, And ye will not go away?
{6:68} Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go away? thou hast the words of eternal life.
{6:69} And we have believed, and known, that thou art Christ, Son of the living God.
{6:70} Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen you twelve, and of you one is a devil?
{6:71} And he spake of Judas Iscariot, of Simon: for he was about to deliver him up, being one of the twelve.
{7:1} And Jesus walked after these in Galilee: for he wished not to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
{7:2} And the festival of the Jews was near, the Pitching of tents.
{7:3} Then said his brethren to him, Go away thence, and retire to Judea, that also thy disciples might see thy works which thou doest.
{7:4} For none does any thing in secret, and seeks himself to be in freedom of speech. If thou do these, make thyself manifest to the world.
{7:5} For neither believed his brethren in him.
{7:6} Then says Jesus to them, My time is not yet present: and your time is always ready.
{7:7} The world cannot hate you: but me it hates, for I testify of it, that its works are evil.
{7:8} Go ye up to this festival: I go not yet up to the festival; for my time has not yet been completed.
{7:9} And speaking to them these things, he remained in Galilee.
{7:10} And when his brethren went up, then he went up to the festival, not openly, but as in secret.
{7:11} Then the Jews sought him in the festival, and said, Where is he.
{7:12} And much murmuring was for him in the crowds: some truly said, That he is good: and others said, No; but he deceives the crowd.
{7:13} However none spake of him with freedom of speech, for fear of the Jews.
{7:14} And now the festival being in the midst, Jesus went up to the temple, and taught.
{7:15} And the Jews wondered, saying, How knows he letters, not having learned.
{7:16} Jesus answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his having sent me.
{7:17} If any desire to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or I speak from myself.
{7:18} He speaking from himself, seeks his own glory: but he seeking the glory of him having sent him, he is true, and no injustice is in him.
{7:19} Has not Moses given you the law, and none of you does the law? Why seek ye to kill me?
{7:20} The crowd answered and said, Thou hast a demon: who seeks to kill thee?
{7:21} Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and ye all marvel for this.
{7:22} Moses has given you circumcision; (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and in the sabbath ye circumcise a man.
{7:23} If a man receive circumcision in the sabbath, that the law of Moses be not loosed; rage not at me, because I made a man wholly well on the Sabbath.
{7:24} Judge not according to sight, but judge just judgment.
{7:25} Then said some of the Jerusalemites, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
{7:26} And, behold, he speaks in freedom of speech, and they say nothing to him. Not at any time knew the rulers truly, that this is truly Christ?
{7:27} But we know this whence he is: and Christ, when he should come, none knows whence he is.
{7:28} Then cried Jesus in the temple, teaching, and saying, And ye know me, and ye know whence I am: and I have not come of myself, but he having sent me is true, whom ye know not.
{7:29} But I know him; for I am from him, and he sent me.
{7:30} Then sought they to seize him: and none put the hand upon him, for his hour had not yet come.
{7:31} And many of the crowd believed on him, and said, That Christ, when he should come, will he do more signs than these which he did?
{7:32} The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things of him; and the Pharisees and chief priests sent servants that they might seize him.
{7:33} Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little time am I with you, and I retire to him having sent me.
{7:34} And ye shall seek me and shall not find: and where I am, ye cannot come.
{7:35} Then said the Jews among themselves, Where is he about to go, that we shall not find him? is he not about to go to the dispersion of the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
{7:36} What is the word which he spake, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find: and where I am, ye cannot come?
{7:37} In the last day, the great one of the festival, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any thirst, let him come to me, and drink.
{7:38} He believing in me, as said the writing, from his belly shall flow rivers of living waters.
{7:39} (This spake he of the Spirit which they believing in him were about to receive: for the Holy Spirit was not yet; for Jesus was not yet honoured.)
{7:40} Then many of the crowd, having heard the word, said, This is truly a prophet.
{7:41} Others said, This is Christ: and others said, Yet Christ comes not out of Galilee.
{7:42} Said not the writing, That of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was, Christ comes?
{7:43} Then was there a division in the crowd on his account.
{7:44} And some of them wished to seize him; but none put hands upon him.
{7:45} Then came the servants to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why did ye not bring him.
{7:46} And the servants answered, Never spake man as this man.
{7:47} Then the Pharisees answered them, Have ye not also been deceived.
{7:48} Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?
{7:49} But the crowd, not knowing the law, are cursed.
{7:50} Nicodemus says to them, (he having come to him by night, being one of them,)
{7:51} Our law judges not a man, except it first hear from him, and know what he does.
{7:52} They answered and said to him, And art thou not of Galilee? Search, and see: for a prophet has not risen out of Galilee.
{7:53} And each man went to his house.
{8:1} And Jesus went to the mount of Olives.
{8:2} And again in the morning he was present in the temple, and all the people came to him; and having sat down, he taught them.
{8:3} And the scribes and Pharisees brought him a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,
{8:4} They say to him, Teacher, this woman was taken committing adultery, in the very act.
{8:5} In the law Moses commanded us such to be stoned: therefore what sayest thou?
{8:6} And this said they, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. And Jesus, having stooped down, wrote with his fingers upon the earth.
{8:7} And when they continued asking him, having lifted up the head, he said to them, Let him faultless among you, first cast a stone at her.
{8:8} And again having stooped down, he wrote upon the earth.
{8:9} And they having heard, and being convicted by consciousness, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest even to the last; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
{8:10} And Jesus having lifted up the head, and seen none but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are they accusing thee? has none condemned thee.
{8:11} And she said, None, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
{8:12} Again therefore Jesus spake to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he following me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
{8:13} Then said the Pharisees to him, Thou testifiest of thyself; thy testimony is not true.
{8:14} Jesus answered and said to them. Though I testify of myself; my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and where I retire; but ye know not whence I came and where I retire.
{8:15} Ye judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.
{8:16} And if I also judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father having sent me.
{8:17} And also in your law has it been written, that the testimony of two men is true.
{8:18} I am he testifying of myself, and the Father having sent me testifies of me.
{8:19} Then said they to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye had known my Father also.
{8:20} These words spake Jesus in the royal treasury, teaching in the temple: and no one seized him; for his hour had not yet come.
{8:21} Then said Jesus again to them, I retire, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I retire, ye cannot come.
{8:22} Then said the Jews, Will he not kill himself? for he says, Where I retire, ye cannot come.
{8:23} And he said to them, Ye are from below I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
{8:24} I said therefore to you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am, ye shall die in your sins.
{8:25} Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus said to them, In the beginning, he which I spake to you.
{8:26} Many things have I to speak and judge of you; but he having sent me is true; and what things I have heard from him these say I to the world.
{8:27} They knew not that he spake to them of the Father.
{8:28} Then said Jesus to them, When ye lift up the Son of man then shall ye know that I am, and I do nothing of myself; but as my Father taught me, these I speak.
{8:29} And he having sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone; for I do always things pleasing to him.
{8:30} He speaking these, many believed in him.
{8:31} Then said Jesus to the Jews having believed him, If ye remain in my word, ye are truly my disciples.
{8:32} And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
{8:33} They answered him, We are Abraham's seed, and have never served any; how sayest thou, That ye shall be free?
{8:34} Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, say I to you, That every one doing sin, is servant of sin.
{8:35} And the servant remains not in the house forever; the Son remains forever.
{8:36} If the Son make you free, ye shall be truly free.
{8:37} I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, for my word has no place in you.
{8:38} I, what I have seen from my Father, speak: and ye, therefore, what ye have seen of your Father, do.
{8:39} They answered and said to him, Abraham is our Father. Jesus says to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye had done Abraham's works.
{8:40} And now ye seek to kill me, a man who has spoken to you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.
{8:41} Ye do the works of your father. Then said they to him, We have not been born of fornication; for we have one Father, God.
{8:42} Then said Jesus to them, If God were your Father, ye had loved me: for I went forth from God, and came; for I have not come of myself, but he sent me.
{8:43} Wherefore ye know not my speech, for ye cannot hear my word.
{8:44} Ye are of your father the devil, and the eager desires of your father will ye do. He was slaying men from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he would speak a lie, he speaks of his own things; for he is a liar, and the father of him.
{8:45} And because I say the truth, ye believe me not.
{8:46} Which of you convicts me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me.
{8:47} He being of God hears the words of God: therefore ye hear not, for ye are not of God.
{8:48} Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?
{8:49} Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me.
{8:50} And I seek not my glory: there is he seeking and judging.
{8:51} Truly, truly, I say to you, If any keep my word, he should never see death.
{8:52} Then said the Jews to him, Now we have known that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If any keep my word, he shall never taste of death.
{8:53} Thou art not greater than our father Abraham, who died; and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?
{8:54} Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father honouring me; whom ye say, that he is your God:
{8:55} And ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like you: but I know him, and keep his word.
{8:56} Your father Abraham was overjoyed that he might see my day: and he saw, and rejoiced.
{8:57} Then said the Jews to him, Thou hast not yet fifty years, and hast thou seen Abraham.
{8:58} And Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was born, I am.
{8:59} Then lifted up they stones that they might cast upon him: and Jesus was hid, and he went forth out of the temple, having passed through the midst of them, and so he passed by.
{9:1} And passing by, he saw a man blind from birth.
{9:2} And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, he, or his parents, that he was born blind?
{9:3} Jesus answered, Neither did this sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God might be manifested in him.
{9:4} I must work the works of him having sent me, while it is day: night comes, when none can work.
{9:5} While I be in the world, I am the light of the world.
{9:6} Having said these, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and rubbed the clay upon the eyes of the blind,
{9:7} And said to him, Retire, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is interpreted, Sent.) He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
{9:8} Then the neighbors, and those seeing him before that he was blind, said, Is not this he sitting and begging?
{9:9} Others said, This is he: and others, That he is like him: he said, That I am.
{9:10} Then said they to him, How were thine eyes opened?
{9:11} He answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Retire to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and having gone and washed, I saw again.
{9:12} Then said they to him, Where is he? He says I know not.
{9:13} They bring him to the Pharisees, him once blind.
{9:14} And it was the sabbath, when Jesus made clay, and opened his eyes.
{9:15} Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he saw again. He said to them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.
{9:16} Then said certain of the Pharisees, This man is not from God, for he keeps not the sabbath. Others said, How can a sinful man do such signs? And a division was among them.
{9:17} They say to the blind again, What sayest thou of him, for he opened thine eyes? He said, That he is a prophet.
{9:18} Then the Jews believed not of him that he was blind, and saw again, until they called the parents of him having looked up.
{9:19} And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom ye say that be was born blind how then does be now see.
{9:20} His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
{9:21} But how he now sees, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: he has age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.
{9:22} These said his parents, for they feared the Jews: for already had the Jews agreed, that if any should acknowledge him Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
{9:23} Therefore said his parents, That he has age; ask him.
{9:24} Then called they the man of a second time, who was blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is sinful.
{9:25} He answered and said, If he be sinful, I know not: one thing I know, that, being blind, now I see.
{9:26} And again said they to him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?
{9:27} He answered them, I told you already, and ye heard not: why wish ye to hear again? ye wish not also to be his disciples?
{9:28} Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.
{9:29} We know that God has spoken to Moses; but this, we know not whence he is.
{9:30} The man answered and said to them, For in this is it wonderful, that ye know not whence he is, and he opened mine eyes.
{9:31} And we know that God hears not the sinful: but if any be godly, and do his will, this he hears.
{9:32} From forever was it not heard that any opened the eyes of him born blind.
{9:33} If this one were not of God, he could do nothing.
{9:34} They answered and said to him, In sins wert thou wholly born, and teachest thou us? And they cast him without.
{9:35} Jesus heard that they cast him without; and having found him, said to him, Believest thou in the Son of God?
{9:36} He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe in him?
{9:37} And Jesus said to him, Thou hast also seen him, and he speaking with thee, the same is he.
{9:38} And he said I believe, Lord. And he worshipped him.
{9:39} And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they not seeing might see; and they seeing might be blind.
{9:40} And they being with him of the Pharisees heard these things, and said to him,
{9:41} We are not also blind? Jesus said to them If ye were blind, ye had not sinned: and now ye say, That we see; therefore your sin remains.
{10:1} Truly, truly, I say to you, He not coming in through the door into the court-yard of the sheep, but coming up from another place, he is a thief and robber.
{10:2} And he coming in through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
{10:3} To him the guard of the door opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.
{10:4} And when he would put forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
{10:5} And a stranger they would not follow, but they will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
{10:6} This proverb spake Jesus to then: and they knew not what things they were which he spake to them.
{10:7} Then said Jesus again to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, That I am the door of the sheep.
{10:8} All who came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep heard them not.
{10:9} I am the door: if any come in through me, he shall be saved, and he shall me in, and go out, and find pasture.
{10:10} The thief comes not, except that he steal, and sacrifice, and destroy: I came that they might have life, and have above measure.
{10:11} I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
{10:12} But the hired one, and not being the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and he leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf plunders them, and scatters the sheep.
{10:13} The hired flees, because he is hired, and no care is to him for the sheep.
{10:14} I am the good shepherd, and I know mine, and am known by mine.
{10:15} As the Father knows me, I also know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
{10:16} And I have, other sheep, which are not of this court-yard: and I must also bring them, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd.
{10:17} Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
{10:18} No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command received I of my Father.
{10:19} Then was a division again among the Jews for these words.
{10:20} And many of them said, He has a demon, and is frenzied; why hear ye him?
{10:21} Others said, These are not the words of a demon. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind.
{10:22} And there was the festival of inauguration among the Jerusalemites, and it was winter.
{10:23} And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.
{10:24} Then the Jews surrounded him, and said to him, How long takest thou away our soul? If thou art Christ, say to us with freedom of speech.
{10:25} Jesus answered them, I said to you, and ye believe not: the works which I do in my Father's name, these testify of me.
{10:26} But ye believe not, for ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you.
{10:27} My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
{10:28} And I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.
{10:29} My Father, who has given to me, is greater than all; and no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand.
{10:30} I and my Father are one.
{10:31} Then again lifted up the Jews stones that they might stone him.
{10:32} Jesus Answered them, Many good works I shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do ye stone me.
{10:33} The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and that thou, being man, makest thyself God.
{10:34} Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said; Ye are gods?
{10:35} If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the writing cannot be loosed;
{10:36} Whom the Father consecrated, and sent into the world, say ye that thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God.
{10:37} If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
{10:38} And if I do, though ye believe me not, believe the works: that ye might know, and believe, that the Father in me, and I in him.
{10:39} Then sought they again to take him: and he went out from their hand,
{10:40} And again he departed beyond Jordan to the place where John was first immersing; and he remained there.
{10:41} And many came to him, and said, That truly John did no sign: but all which John said of him was true.
{10:42} And many believed in him there.
{11:1} And a certain Lazarus was sick, from Bethany, of the town of Mary And Martha her sister.
{11:2} (And Mary was she having anointed the Lord with perfumed oil, and wiped his feet with her hairs, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
{11:3} Then sent the sisters to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
{11:4} And Jesus having heard, said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that by it the Son of God be honoured.
{11:5} And Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
{11:6} When therefore he heard that he is sick, then indeed he remained in the place in which he was two days.
{11:7} Then after this he says to his disciples, Let us go into Judea again.
{11:8} The disciples say to him, Rabbi, now the Jews sought to stone thee; and retirest thou there again?
{11:9} Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours of the day? If any walk in the day, he stumbles not, for he sees the light of this world.
{11:10} But if any walk in the night, he stumbles, for light is not in him.
{11:11} These things said he: and after this he says to them, Lazarus our friend has been set to sleep; but I go, that I might waken him.
{11:12} Then said his disciples, Lord, if he has been set to sleep, he shall be saved.
{11:13} And Jesus spake of his death: but these supposed that he speaks of the repose of sleep.
{11:14} Then therefore Jesus said to them with freedom of speech, Lazarus is dead.
{11:15} And I rejoice for you, that ye might believe, that I was not there; but let us go to him.
{11:16} Then said Thomas, called Didymus, to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we might die with him.
{11:17} Then Jesus, having come, found him having four days already in the tomb.
{11:18} And Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia.
{11:19} And many of the Jews were come to them about Martha and Many, that they might console them for their brother.
{11:20} Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus comes, met him: and Mary sat in the house.
{11:21} Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
{11:22} But now I also know, that whatever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.
{11:23} Jesus says to her, Thy brother shall arise.
{11:24} Martha says to him, I know that he shall rise at the rising up in the last day.
{11:25} Jesus said to her, I am the rising up, and life: he believing in me, though he die, shall live.
{11:26} And all living and believing in me should never die. Believest thou this?
{11:27} She says to him, Yes, Lord: I have believed that thou art Christ, the Son of God, he coming into the world.
{11:28} And having said these, she departed and called Mary her sister secretly, having said, The Teacher is come, and calls thee.
{11:29} She, when she heard, arises quickly, and comes to him.
{11:30} And Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met him.
{11:31} Then the Jews being in the house with her, and consoling her, having seen Mary, that she rose quickly and went forth, followed her, saying, That she retires to the tomb, that she might weep there.
{11:32} Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him, fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou wert here, my brother had not died.
{11:33} Then Jesus, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping having come with her, was heavy in spirit, and troubled himself,
{11:34} And said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see.
{11:35} Jesus wept.
{11:36} Then said the Jews, See how he loved him!
{11:37} And certain of them said, Could not he having opened the eyes of the blind, have made that this should not die?
{11:38} Then Jesus again being heavy in himself, comes to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was laid upon it.
{11:39} Jesus says, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead, says to him, Lord, he already smells: for it is the fourth day.
{11:40} Jesus says to her, Said I not to thee, if thou shouldest believe, thou shalt see the glory of God.
{11:41} Then took they away the stone where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes above, and said, Father, I return thee thanks that thou didst hear me.
{11:42} And I knew that thou always hearest me: but for the crowd standing round I said, that they might believe that thou didst send me.
{11:43} And having said these, he cried out with a great voice, Lazarus, come out.
{11:44} And the dead came out, bound feet and hands with bandages; and his face was bound with a napkin. Jesus says to them, Loose him, and let him retire.
{11:45} Then many of the Jews, having come to Mary, and seeing what Jesus did, believed in him.
{11:46} But certain of them departed to the Pharisees, and said to them what Jesus did.
{11:47} Then gathered together the chief priests and Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many signs.
{11:48} If we let him thus go, all will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away also our place and nation.
{11:49} And a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being chief priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing,
{11:50} Neither turn ye in your thoughts that it is profitable to us, that one man die for the people, and the nation perish not.
{11:51} And this he said not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation;
{11:52} And not for the nation alone, but that also the children of God, scattered, should be gathered into one.
{11:53} Then from that day they counselled together that they might kill him.
{11:54} Jesus then walked no more with freedom of speech among the Jews; but departed thence to the country near the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there he tarried with his disciples.
{11:55} And the Jews' pascha was near: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the pascha, that they might purify themselves.
{11:56} Then sought they Jesus, and said with one another, standing in the temple, What seems it to you, that he should not come to the festival.
{11:57} And also the chief priests and Pharisees had given a command, that if any know where he is, he should make known, that they might take him.
{12:1} Then Jesus, six days before the pascha, came to Bethany, where was Lazarus the dead, whom he raised from the dead.
{12:2} Then made they him a supper there, and Martha served; and Lazarus was one of them reclining at table with him.
{12:3} Then Mary having taken a pound of perfumed oil of spikenard, very precious, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hairs: and the house was filled with the smell of the perfumed oil.
{12:4} Then says one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, of Simon, being about to deliver him up,
{12:5} Wherefore was not this perfumed oil sold for three hundred drachmas, and given to the poor?
{12:6} And this he said, not that care was to him for the poor: but because he was a thief, and had the small coffer, and carried things deposited.
{12:7} Then said Jesus, Let her go; for the day of my interment has she kept this.
{12:8} For the poor have ye always with you; and me ye have not always.
{12:9} Then a great crowd of Jews knew that he is there: and they came not for Jesus alone, but that also they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
{12:10} And the chief priests took counsel that they might also kill Lazarus;
{12:11} Because many for him retired, and believed in Jesus.
{12:12} The morrow a great crowd, having come to the festival, having heard that Jesus comes to Jerusalem,
{12:13} Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to the meeting to him, and cried, Praised he coming in the name of the Lord, King of Israel.
{12:14} And Jesus having found a small ass, sat upon it; as it is written,
{12:15} Fear not, O daughter of Sion: behold, thy King comes, sitting upon the foal of an ass.
{12:16} And these the disciples knew not at first: but when Jesus was honoured, then remembered they that these were written of him, and they did these things to him.
{12:17} The crowd therefore testified which being with him, that he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead.
{12:18} And for this the crowd met him, for they heard he had done this sign.
{12:19} Then said the Pharisees among themselves, Ye see that ye aid nothing; behold, the world has departed after him.
{12:20} And there were certain Greeks of those going up that they might worship in the festival:
{12:21} These then came to Philip, him of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Lord, we wish to see Jesus.
{12:22} Philip comes and says to Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip say to Jesus.
{12:23} And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come, that the Son of man should be honoured.
{12:24} Truly, truly, I say to you, except a kernel of wheat, having fallen into the earth, should die, it remains alone: and if it should die, it brings forth much fruit.
{12:25} He loving his soul shall lose it; but he hating his soul in this world, shall guard it for life eternal.
{12:26} If any one would serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be my servant: and if any one serve me, him will the Father honour.
{12:27} Now has my soul been troubled; and what should I say? O Father, save me from this hour: but for this came I to this hour.
{12:28} Father, honour thy name. Then came a voice from heaven, I have also honoured, and will again honour.
{12:29} Then the crowd, having stood and heard, said it was thunder: others said, A messenger has spoken to him.
{12:30} Jesus answered and said, This voice has not been for me, but for you.
{12:31} Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.
{12:32} And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all to myself.
{12:33} This said he, signifying what death he was about to die.
{12:34} The crowd answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ remains forever: and how sayest thou That the Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
{12:35} Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little time the light is with you. Walk while ye have light, lest darkness overtake you: and he walking in darkness knows not where he retires.
{12:36} While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye might be the sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and having departed, he was hid from them.
{12:37} And he having done so many signs before them, they did not believe in him:
{12:38} That the word of Esaias the prophet might be completed, which he spake, Lord, who believed our report? and to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed?
{12:39} Therefore they could not believe, for Esaias said again,
{12:40} He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart: lest they see with the eyes, and understand with the heart, and should turn back, and I should heal them.
{12:41} These said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.
{12:42} Yet nevertheless also many of the rulers believed in him; but on account of the Pharisees they did not acknowledge, lest they should be excluded from the synagogue:
{12:43} For they loved the honour of men more than the honour of God.
{12:44} Jesus cried and said, He believing in me, believes not in me, but in him having sent me.
{12:45} And he seeing me, sees him having sent me.
{12:46} I have come a light into the world, that every one believing in me should not remain in darkness.
{12:47} And if any hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.
{12:48} He rejecting me, and not receiving my words, has him judging him: the word which I spake, that shall judge him in the last day.
{12:49} For I spake not of myself; but the Father having sent me, he gave me a command, what I should say, and what I should speak.
{12:50} And I know that his command is life eternal: therefore what I speak, as the Father said to me, so I speak.
{13:1} And before the feast of the pascha, Jesus knowing that his hour had come that he should pass out of this world to the Father, having loved his own in the world, he loved them to the end.
{13:2} And supper having been, the devil having already cast into the heart of Judas Iscariot, of Simon, that he should deliver him up;
{13:3} Jesus knowing that the Father has given all things to him into the hands, and that he came out from God, and retired to God;
{13:4} He arises from supper, and lays down the garments; and having taken a linen cloth, he girded himself.
{13:5} Then casts he water into a washing vessel, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe with the linen cloth with which he was girded.
{13:6} And he comes to Simon Peter: and he says to him, Lord, washest thou my feet?
{13:7} Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know after these.
{13:8} Peter says to him, Thou shouldest never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, Except I wash thee, thou hast no part with me.
{13:9} Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not my feet only, but the hands and head.
{13:10} Jesus says to him, He washed has no need but to have the feet washed, but is wholly clean: and ye are clean, but not all.
{13:11} For he knew him delivering him up, therefore he said, Ye are not all clean.
{13:12} When therefore he washed their feet; and took his garments, going to recline again, he said to them, Knew ye what I have done to you?
{13:13} Ye call one Teacher and Lord: and ye say well; for I am.
{13:14} If therefore, I washed your feet, the Lord and Teacher; ye also ought to wash the feet of one another:
{13:15} For I have given you a pattern, as I have done to you, also should ye do.
{13:16} Truly, truly I say to you, The servant is not greater than his Lord; neither the sent greater than he having sent him.
{13:17} If ye know these, happy are ye if ye do them.
{13:18} I say not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the writing might be completed, He chewing bread with me lifted up his heel against me.
{13:19} From now I say to you, before it shall be, that, when it should be, ye might believe that I am.
{13:20} Truly, truly, I say to you, He receiving whomsoever I shall send receives me; and he receiving me receives him having sent me.
{13:21} These things Jesus having spoken, was troubled in spirit, and he testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.
{13:22} Then looked the disciples one upon another, being perplexed of whom he spake.
{13:23} And there was one of his disciples reclining on the bosom of Jesus, whom he loved.
{13:24} Then Simon Peter nodded to this one, to inquire who it might be of whom he speaks.
{13:25} And he reclining upon Jesus' breast says to him, Lord, who is it?
{13:26} Jesus answers, This is he to whom I, having dipped a small morsel, shall bestow. And having dipped the small morsel, he gives to Judas Iscariot, of Simon.
{13:27} And after the small morsel then came Satan into him. Then says Jesus to him, What thou doest, do quickly.
{13:28} And this none of the reclining knew for what he said to him.
{13:29} For some thought, since Judas had the small coffer, that Jesus says to him, Purchase of what we have need for the festival; or, that he might give something to the poor.
{13:30} He having taken the small morsel went quickly forth: and it was night when he then went forth.
{13:31} Jesus says, Now was the Son of man honoured, and God was honoured in him.
{13:32} If God were honoured in him, also shall God honour him in himself, and quickly shall he honour him.
{13:33} Little children, yet a little am I with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, That where I retire, ye cannot come; and I say to you now.
{13:34} A new command give I to you, That ye love one another: as I loved you, that ye also love one another.
{13:35} In this all shall know that ye are disciples to me, if ye have love in one another.
{13:36} Simon Peter says to him, Lord, where retirest thou? Jesus answered him, Where I retire, thou shalt not be able to follow me now; and afterwards thou shalt follow me.
{13:37} Peter says to him, Lord, why can I not follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.
{13:38} Jesus answered, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me Truly, truly, I say to thee, The cock shall not utter a sound, till thou deny me thrice.
{14:1} Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, and believe in me.
{14:2} In my Father's house are many dwellings: and if not, I had said to you. I go to prepare a place for you.
{14:3} And if I go and prepare a place for you, again I come, and I will receive you to myself; that where I am, ye might be also.
{14:4} And where I retire ye know, and the way ye know.
{14:5} Thomas says to him, Lord, we know not where thou retirest; and how can we know the way?
{14:6} Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one comes to the Father, except by me.
{14:7} If ye had known me, ye had also known my Father: and from now ye know, and have seen him.
{14:8} Philip says to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffices us.
{14:9} Jesus says, to him, So long time am I with you, and hast thou not known me, Philip? he having seen me has seen the Father; and how sayest thou, Show us the Father?
{14:10} Believest thou not that I in the Father, and the Father is in me? the words which I speak to you, I speak not of myself: and the Father remaining in me does the works.
{14:11} Believe ye me that I in the Father, and the Father in me: and if not, for these works believe me.
{14:12} Truly, truly, I say to you, He believing in me, the works which I do shall he do also; and greater than these shall he do; for I go to my Father.
{14:13} And whatever ye ask in my name, this will I do, that the Father might be honoured by the Son.
{14:14} If ye ask anything in my name, I will do.
{14:15} If ye love me, keep my commands.
{14:16} And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Intercessor, that should remain with you forever;
{14:17} The Spirit of truth; which the world cannot receive, for it sees it not, neither knows: and ye know it; for it shall remain with you, and shall be in you.
{14:18} I will not leave you orphans; I come to you.
{14:19} Yet a little, and the world sees me no more; and ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.
{14:20} In that day shall ye know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
{14:21} He having my commands, and keeping them, the same is he loving me: and he loving me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and manifest myself to him.
{14:22} Judas says to him, not Iscariot, Lord, how has it been that thou art about to make thyself manifest to us, and not to the world?
{14:23} Jesus answered and said to him, If any one love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and we will make our stay with him.
{14:24} He not loving me will not keep my words: and the word which ye hear is not of me, but of the Father having sent me.
{14:25} These have I spoken to you, remaining with you.
{14:26} But the Intercessor, the Holy Spirit, which the Father will send in my name, the same shall teach you all things, and he shall remind you of all things which I spake to you.
{14:27} Peace I leave to you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be timid.
{14:28} Ye have heard that I said to you, I retire, and I am coming to you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice because I said, I go to the Father: for my Father is greater than I.
{14:29} And now have I told you before it shall be, that when it should be, ye might believe.
{14:30} I will no more speak much with you: for the ruler of this world comes, and has nothing in me.
{14:31} But that the world might know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, so I do. Arise ye, let us go thence.
{15:1} I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
{15:2} Every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes away: and every one bearing fruit, he cleanses it, that it might bear more fruit.
{15:3} Already are ye clean, through the word which I have spoken to you.
{15:4} Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, if it remain not in the vine; so neither ye, if ye remain not in me.
{15:5} I am the vine, ye the branches: he remaining in me, and I in him, he bears much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.
{15:6} If any remain not in me, he was cast forth as the branch, and was dried up; and they gather them together, and cast into the fire, and they are burned.
{15:7} If ye remain in me, and my words remain in you, ye shall ask whatever ye wish, and it shall be to you.
{15:8} In this was my Father honoured, that ye should bear much fruit: and ye shall be disciples to me.
{15:9} As the Father loved me, I also loved you: remain in my love.
{15:10} If ye keep my commands, ye shall remain in my love; as I have kept my Father's commands, and remain in his love.
{15:11} These things have I spoken to you, that my joy might remain in you, and your joy might be completed.
{15:12} This is my command, That ye love one another, as I loved you.
{15:13} Greater love than this has none, that any lay down his life for his friends.
{15:14} Ye are my friends, if ye do whatever I command you.
{15:15} I no more call you servants; for the servant knows not what his lord does: and I have called you friends; for all which I heard of my Father I made known to you.
{15:16} Ye chose not me, but I chose you, and I have set you, that ye might retire and bear fruit, and your fruit remain: that whatever ye ask the Father in my name, he might give you.
{15:17} These things I command you, that ye love one another.
{15:18} If the world hate you, know that it has hated me the first of you.
{15:19} If ye were of the world, the world had loved its own: and because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
{15:20} Remember the word which I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they expelled me, they will also expel you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.
{15:21} But all these will they do to you for my name, for they know not him having sent me.
{15:22} If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not sin and now they have no pretext for their sin.
{15:23} He hating me hates my Father also.
{15:24} If I did not the works in them which none other has done, they had not sin: and now have they also seen and hated also me and my Father.
{15:25} But that the word written in their law might be completed, That they hated me gratuitously.
{15:26} And when the Intercessor should come, which I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, which comes from the Father, he shall testify of me:
{15:27} And ye also testify, for ye are with me from the beginning.
{16:1} These have I spoken, that ye should not be offended.
{16:2} They shall make you excluded from the synagogue: but the hour comes that every one having slain you should think to bring service to God.
{16:3} And these things shall they do to you, for they know not the Father, nor me.
{16:4} But these have I spoken to you, that when the hour should come, ye should remember them, for I said to you. And these I said not to you from the beginning, for I was with you.
{16:5} But now do I retire to him having sent me; and not one of you asks me, Where dost thou retire.
{16:6} But because I have spoken these to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
{16:7} But I say the truth to you; it is profitable to you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Intercessor shall not come to you; and if I go, I will send him to you.
{16:8} And having come, he will convict the world of sin, and of justice, and of judgment:
{16:9} Truly of sin, because they believe not in me;
{16:10} And of justice, because I retire to my Father, and ye see me no more;
{16:11} And of judgment, for the ruler of this world has been judged.
{16:12} I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now.
{16:13} And when he should come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he should hear, shall he speak: and he shall announce to you the things coming.
{16:14} He shall honour me: for he shall take of mine, and announce to you.
{16:15} All things which the Father has are mine: therefore said I, he shall take of mine, and announce to you.
{16:16} A little while, and ye see me not: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, and because I retire to the Father.
{16:17} Then said of his disciples to one another, What is this which he says to you, A little, and ye see me not: and again, a little, and ye shall see me: and, Because I retire to my Father?
{16:18} Then said they, What is this which he says, A little we know not what he says.
{16:19} Then knew Jesus that they wished to ask him, and he said to them, For this seek ye with one another that I said, A little while, and ye see me not; and again a little, and ye shall see me.
{16:20} Truly, truly, I say to you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be grieved, but your grief shall be into joy.
{16:21} A woman when she should bring forth, has grief, because her hour has come: and when the child should be born, she no more remembers the anguish, for the joy that a man was born into the world.
{16:22} And where truly ye now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes away from you.
{16:23} And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, That whatever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you.
{16:24} Until now ye have asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy might be completed.
{16:25} These have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the hour comes, when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but with freedom of speech will I announce to you of the Father.
{16:26} In that day shall ye ask in my name: and I say not to you that I will ask the Father for you:
{16:27} For the Father himself loves you, for ye have loved me, and believed that I came forth from God.
{16:28} I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
{16:29} His disciples say to him, See, now thou speakest with freedom of speech, and sayest no proverb.
{16:30} Now we know that thou knowest all things, and hast no need that any ask thee: by this we believe that thou earnest forth from God.
{16:31} Jesus answered them, Now do ye believe?
{16:32} Behold, the hour comes, and has now come, that ye be scattered, each to his own, and leave me alone: and I am not alone, for the Father is with me.
{16:33} These have I spoken to you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world shall ye have pressure; but take courage; I have conquered the world.
{17:1} These spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour has come; honour thy Son, that thy Son honour thee:
{17:2} As thou gavest him the power of all flesh, that every one which thou hast given him, he should give to them eternal life.
{17:3} And this is eternal life, that they might know thee the only true God, and whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ.
{17:4} I honoured thee upon earth: I finished the work which thou hast given me that I should do.
{17:5} And now, honour thou me, O Father, with thyself, with the honour which I had with thee before the world was.
{17:6} I manifested thy name to the men which thou hast given me from the world: they were to thee, and thou hast given them to me; and they have kept thy word.
{17:7} Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.
{17:8} For the words which thou hast given me, I have given them and they received, and knew in truth that I came out from thee, and they believed that thou sentest me.
{17:9} I ask for them: I ask not for the world, but for them thou hast given me: for they are to thee.
{17:10} And all my things are thine, and thine mine; and I have been honoured in them.
{17:11} And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. O holy Father, keep them in thy name whom thou but given me, that they might be one, as we.
{17:12} When I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those thou hast given me I watched, and not one of them perished, except the son of perdition; that the writing might be completed.
{17:13} And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that I might have my joy completed in them.
{17:14} I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, for they are not of the world, as I am not of the world.
{17:15} I ask not that thou take them out of the world, but that thou keep them from the evil.
{17:16} They are not of the world, as I am not of the world.
{17:17} Render them holy in thy truth: thy word is truth.
{17:18} As thou sentest me into the world, I also sent them into the world.
{17:19} And for them I render myself holy, that they also be rendered holy in the truth;
{17:20} And I ask not for these alone, but also for them believing in me through their word;
{17:21} That all might be one; as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee, that they also be one in us; that the world might believe that thou sentest me.
{17:22} And I, the honour which thou hast given me, have given them; that they might be one, as we are one.
{17:23} I in them, and thou in me, that they might be perfected in one: and that the world might know that thou sentest me, and lovedst them, as thou lovedst me.
{17:24} O Father, those thou hast given me, I will that where I am these also be with me: that they might behold my glory, which thou gavest me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
{17:25} O just Father, the world knew thee not: but I knew thee, and these knew that thou didst send me.
{17:26} And I made known to them thy name, and I will make known: that the love with which thou lovedst me might be in them, and I in them.
{18:1} Jesus having said these, went out with his disciples beyond the torrent Kedron, where was a garden, into which he came, he and his disciples.
{18:2} And Judas also knew the place, he delivering him up: for Jesus was many times gathered there with his disciples.
{18:3} Then Judas, having taken a band and attendants from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes there with lights and torches and weapons.
{18:4} Jesus then, knowing all coming upon him, having come out, said to them, Whom seek ye.
{18:5} They answered him, Jesus the Nazarite. Jesus says to them, I am. And Judas also, he delivering up, was standing with them.
{18:6} Then, when he said to them, That I am, they went away backward, and fell to the ground.
{18:7} Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus the Nazarite.
{18:8} Jesus answered, I said to you, that I am: if then ye seek me, leave these to retire:
{18:9} That the word might be completed which he spake, That whom thou hast given me, I lost none of them.
{18:10} Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and struck the chief priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. And the name to the servant was Malchus.
{18:11} Then said Jesus to Peter, Put thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it.
{18:12} Then the band and captain of a thousand and attendants of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,
{18:13} And led him away to Annas first; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the chief priest that year.
{18:14} And Caiaphas was he having counselled the Jews, that it is profitable for one man to be destroyed for the people.
{18:15} And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and another disciple: and that disciple was known to the chief priest, and came together with Jesus to the hall of the chief priest.
{18:16} And Peter stood before the door without. Then went out the other disciple who was known to the chief priest, and spake to her guarding the door, and brought in Peter.
{18:17} Then says the young girl guarding the door to Peter, Art not thou also of this man's disciples? He says, I am not.
{18:18} And the servants and attendants stood, having made a heap of burning coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter was standing with them, and warming himself.
{18:19} Then the chief priest asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.
{18:20} Jesus answered him, I spake with freedom of speech to the world: I always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews were always come together; and I spake nothing in secret.
{18:21} Why askest thou me? ask those having heard, what I said to them: see, they know what I said.
{18:22} And he having said these things, one of the attendants standing by gave Jesus a blow with a rod, having said, Answerest thou the chief priest so?
{18:23} Jesus answered him, If I spake badly, testify of evil: and if well, why strikest thou me?
{18:24} (Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest.)
{18:25} And Simon Peter was standing, and warming himself. Then said they to him, Art thou not also of his disciples he denied, and said, I am not.
{18:26} Says one of the chief priest's servants, being of his family whose ear Peter cut off, Saw I not thee in the garden with him?
{18:27} Then Peter again denied: and quickly the cock uttered a sound.
{18:28} Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the pretorium: and it was early morning; and they came not into the pretorium, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the pascha.
{18:29} Then went Pilate out to them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man.
{18:30} They answered and said to him, If he were not injurious, we had not delivered him to thee.
{18:31} Then said Pilate to them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. Then said the Jews to him, It is not lawful for us to kill any one:
{18:32} That the word of Jesus might be completed which he spake, giving a sign by what death he was about to die.
{18:33} Then came Pilate again into the pretorium, and asked Jesus, and said to him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
{18:34} Jesus answered him, of thyself sayest thou this, or did others tell thee of me?
{18:35} Pilate answered, Much less am I a Jew; thy nation and the chief priests have delivered thee to me: What didst thou?
{18:36} Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had contended, that I be not delivered to the Jews; and now my kingdom is not hence.
{18:37} Then said Pilate to him, Art thou not then king? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world, that I testify to the truth. Every one being of the truth hears my voice.
{18:38} Pilate says to him, What is truth? And having said this, again went he out to the Jews, and says to them, I find no fault in him.
{18:39} But a custom is to you, that I loose one to you in the pascha: will ye therefore I should loose to you the King of the Jews.
{18:40} Then cried they all again, saying, Not this, but Barabbas: and Barabbas was a robber.
{19:1} Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
{19:2} And the soldiers having twined a crown of thorns, put upon his head, and they put round him a purple robe,
{19:3} And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they gave him blows with a rod.
{19:4} Then again went out Pilate without, and says to them, See, I lead him to you without, that ye might know that in him I find no fault.
{19:5} Then went forth Jesus without, bearing a crown of thorns, and a purple garment. And he says to them, Behold the man!
{19:6} When therefore the chief priests and attendants saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify, crucify. Pilate says to them, Take ye him, and crucify; for I find no fault in him.
{19:7} The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, for he made himself the Son of God.
{19:8} When Pilate heard this word, he was more afraid:
{19:9} And went into the pretorium again, and says to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
{19:10} Then says Pilate to him, Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to loose thee.
{19:11} Jesus answered, Thou hast no power against me, if it were not given thee from above: therefore he delivering me to thee has greater sin.
{19:12} From this Pilate sought to loose him: and the Jews cried out, saying, If thou loose this, thou art not Caesar's friend: every one making himself a king speaks against Caesar.
{19:13} Then Pilate having heard, brought Jesus without, and sat upon the judgment seat, in a place called Paved with ornamental stones; in Hebraic, Gabbatha.
{19:14} And it was the preparation of the pascha, and about the sixth hour: and he says to the Jews, Behold your King!
{19:15} And they cried, Take away, take away, crucify him. Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
{19:16} Then, therefore, delivered he him to them, that he might be crucified.
{19:17} And they took Jesus, and led away: and bearing his cross he went out into a place called Kranium, which in Hebraic is called Golgotha:
{19:18} Where they crucified him, and with him two others, hence and thence, and Jesus in the midst.
{19:19} And Pilate also wrote a title, and put upon the cross. And it was written, JESUS THE NAZARITE, KING OF THE JEWS.
{19:20} Then read many of the Jews this title: for the place was near the city where Jesus was crucified: and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, Roman.
{19:21} Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
{19:22} Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.
{19:23} Then the soldiers, when they crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part: and also the coat: and the coat was unsewn through the whole, having been woven from above.
{19:24} Then said they to one another, Let us not divide it, but let us draw lots for it, whose it shall be: that the writing might be completed, saying, They divided my garments to themselves, and upon my clothing cast they the lot. Then truly did the soldiers these things.
{19:25} And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
{19:26} Jesus then having seen the mother, and the disciple standing near, whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
{19:27} Then says he to the disciple, Behold thy mother And from that hour the disciple took her to his own.
{19:28} After this, Jesus knowing that all things were already completed, that the writing might be finished, says, I thirst.
{19:29} Then was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they having filled a sponge with vinegar, put upon hyssop, and brought near to his mouth.
{19:30} When Jesus therefore took the vinegar, he said, It has been finished: and having bent the head, he delivered up the spirit.
{19:31} Then the Jews, that the bodies remain not upon the cross in the sabbath, since it was the preparation, (for great was the day of that sabbath,) asked Pilate that their legs be broken, and they be taken away.
{19:32} Then came the soldiers, and truly brake the legs of the first, and of the other crucified with him.
{19:33} And upon having come to Jesus, when they saw him already dead, they brake not his legs:
{19:34} But one of the soldiers with a javelin pricked his side, and quickly came out blood and water.
{19:35} And he having seen has testified, and his testimony is true: and he knows that he says true, that ye might believe.
{19:36} For these were that the writing be completed, A bone of him shall not be broken.
{19:37} And again another writing says, They shall look on whom they goaded.
{19:38} And after these, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, in secret, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might takeaway the body of Jesus: and Pilate conceded. He came then, and took the body of Jesus.
{19:39} And Nicodemus also came, he having come to Jesus at first by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred pounds.
{19:40} Then took they the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen bandages with spices, as the custom is to the Jews to prepare a body for interment.
{19:41} And in the place where he was crucified, was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one was ever laid.
{19:42} There, therefore, on account of the Jews' preparation, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.
{20:1} And in one of the sabbaths comes Mary Magdalene in the morning, there yet being darkness, to the tomb, and sees the stone taken away from the tomb.
{20:2} Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and says to them, They took away the Lord from the tomb; and we know not where they laid him.
{20:3} Peter then came forth, and the other disciple, and they came to the tomb.
{20:4} And they two ran together: and the other disciple ran before, swifter than Peter, and came first to the tomb.
{20:5} And having stood stooping, he sees the linen bandages lying; yet he did not go in.
{20:6} Then comes Simon Peter following him, and he came into the tomb, and sees the linen bandages lying,
{20:7} And the napkin, which was upon his head, not lying with the linen bandages, but separately inwrapped in one place.
{20:8} Then, therefore, went in also the other disciple, having first come to the tomb, and he saw, and believed.
{20:9} For not yet knew they the writing, that he must rise from the dead.
{20:10} Then went away the disciples again by themselves.
{20:11} And Mary stood near the tomb weeping without: therefore as she wept, she stood stooping into the tomb,
{20:12} And sees two messengers in white, sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus was laid.
{20:13} And they say to her, Woman, why weepest thou? She says to them, Because they took away my Lord, and I know not where they laid him.
{20:14} And having said these, she was turned back, and sees Jesus standing, and she knew not that it is Jesus.
{20:15} Jesus says to her, Woman, why weepest thou a whom seekest thou? She, thinking that it is the gardener, says to him, Lord, if thou didst bear him away, say where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
{20:16} Jesus says to her, Mary, She having turned, says to him, Rabboni; which is called, Teacher.
{20:17} Jesus says to her, Touch me not; for I have not yet ascended to my Father: and go thou to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; to my God, and your God.
{20:18} Mary Magdalene comes announcing to the disciples that she has seen the Lord, and he said these to her.
{20:19} Then it being evening, in that one day of the sabbaths, and the doors shut where the disciples were gathered together for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says to them, Peace to you.
{20:20} And having said this, he showed them his hands, and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced, having seen the Lord.
{20:21} Then said Jesus again to them, Peace to you: as the Father has sent me, I also send you.
{20:22} And having said this, he inspired, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit:
{20:23} Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them: whose soever ye retain, they have been retained.
{20:24} And Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
{20:25} Then said the other disciples to him, We have seen the Lord. And he said to them, Except I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger in the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
{20:26} And after eight days again were his disciples within, and Thomas with them: Jesus comes, the doors shut, and said, Peace to you.
{20:27} Then says he to Thomas, Bring hither thy finger, and see my hands; and bring thy hand, and put into my side: and be not unbelieving, but believing.
{20:28} And Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.
{20:29} Jesus says to him, Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed: happy they not having seen, and having believed.
{20:30} Then truly many other signs did Jesus also before his disciples, which are not written in this small book:
{20:31} But these have been written, that ye might believe that Jesus is Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life in his name.
{21:1} After these things Jesus again manifested himself to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias and so he made manifest.
{21:2} There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and nathanael from Cana of Galilee, and they of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
{21:3} Simon Peter says to them, I retire to fish. They say to him, We also go with thee. They came forth, and went up into the ship quickly; and in that night they caught nothing.
{21:4} And morning being already come, Jesus stood on the sea-shore: yet the disciples knew not that it is Jesus.
{21:5} Then says Jesus to them, Children, have ye nothing cooked to eat? They answered him, No.
{21:6} And he said to them, Cast the net to the right parts of the ship, and ye shall find. Therefore they cast, and were no more able to draw it, from the multitude of fishes.
{21:7} Then that disciple says, whom Jesus loved, to Peter, It is the Lord. Then Simon Peter having heard that it is the Lord, girded round the upper garment, (for he was naked,) and cast himself into the sea.
{21:8} And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as from two hundred cubits) dragging the net of fishes.
{21:9} When therefore they came away to the land, they see a heap of burning coals laid, and little fish laid upon, and bread.
{21:10} Jesus says to them, Bring ye from the little fishes which ye have now caught.
{21:11} Simon Peter went up, and drew the net upon the earth, full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty-three: and being so many, the net was not split.
{21:12} And Jesus says to them, Come, dine. And none of the disciples dared to inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it is the Lord.
{21:13} Then comes Jesus, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise.
{21:14} This already the third time Jesus was manifested to his disciples, having risen from the dead.
{21:15} Then, when they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He says to him, Yes, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He says to him, Feed my lambs.
{21:16} Jesus says to him again the second time, Simon of Jonas, lovest thou me? He says to him, Yes, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He says to him, Feed my sheep.
{21:17} He says to him the third time, Simon of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved that he said the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, Lord, thou knowest all; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus says to him, Feed my sheep.
{21:18} Truly, truly, I say to thee, when thou west younger, thou didst gird thyself and walk where thou wouldest; and when thou shalt grow old, thou shalt stretch out thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou wilt not.
{21:19} And this he said, signifying by what death he shall honour God. And having said this, he says to him, Follow me.
{21:20} And Peter having turned back, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also reclined in the supper upon his breast, and said, Lord, who is he delivering thee up.
{21:21} Peter having seen him, says to Jesus, Lord, and what this.
{21:22} Jesus says to him, If I will him to remain till I come, what to thee? follow me.
{21:23} Then went out the word to the brethren, That this disciple dies not: and Jesus said not to him, That he dies not; but, If I will him to remain till I come, what to thee?
{21:24} This is the disciple testifying of these, and having written this: and we know that his testimony is true.
{21:25} And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they be written every one, neither do I suppose the world itself will receive the books written. Amen.
