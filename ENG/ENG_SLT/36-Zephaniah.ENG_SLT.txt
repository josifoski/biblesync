{1:1} The word of Jehovah which was to Zephaniah son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah.
{1:2} Taking away, I will take away all from off the face of the earth, says Jehovah
{1:3} I will take away man and cattle; I will take away the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the unjust; and I cut off man from the face of the earth, says Jehovah.
{1:4} And I stretched out my hand upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I cut off from this place the remnant of Baal, with the name of the obscurations with the priests.
{1:5} And those worshiping upon the roofs to the army of the heavens, and worshiping, swearing to Jehovah, and swearing to Malcham;
{1:6} And those departing from after Jehovah, and who sought not Jehovah, and asked not for him.
{1:7} Be silent from the face of the Lord Jehovah: for the day of Jehovah is near, for Jehovah prepared a swam he consecrated his called ones.
{1:8} And it was in the day of the sacrifice of Jehovah, and I reviewed upon the chiefs and upon the sons of the king, and upon all having put on strange clothing.
{1:9} And I reviewed upon every one leaping upon the threshold in that day, filling their lords houses with violence and deceit.
{1:10} And it was in that day, says Jehovah, a voice of a cry from the gate of fishes, and a wailing from the second, and a great breaking from the hills.
{1:11} Wail, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the people of Canaan were destroyed; all lifting up silver were cut off.
{1:12} And it was in that time, I will search out Jerusalem with lights, and I reviewed upon the men curdled upon their lees, saying in their heart, Jehovah will do good and not evil.
{1:13} And their wealth was for plunder, and their houses for desolation: and they built houses, and they inhabited not; and they planted vineyards, and they shall not drink their wine.
{1:14} The great day of Jehovah is near, it is near and hastening greatly, the voice of the day of Jehovah: the strong one cried there bitterly.
{1:15} A day of wrath, that day a day of straits and distress, a day of storm and desolation, a day of darkness and thick darkness, a day of cloud and gloom,
{1:16} A day of the trumpet and loud noise against the fortified cities, and against the high pinnacles.
{1:17} And I pressed upon man, and they went as the blind, because they sinned against Jehovah: and their blood was poured out as dust and their bread as dung.
{1:18} Also their silver also their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah; and all the land shall be consumed by the fire of his jealousy: for he will make a completion even sudden of all dwelling in the land.
{2:1} Collect yourselves together and be ye collected, O nation not ashamed;
{2:2} Before the law bring forth, as the chaff the day passing away before the burning of the anger of Jehovah shall not come upon you, before the day of the anger of Jehovah shall not come upon you.
{2:3} Seek Jehovah, all ye humble of the earth, who did his judgment; seek justice, seek humility: perhaps ye shall be covered in the day of the anger of Jehovah.
{2:4} For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon for a desolation: they shall thrust out Ashdod at noon, and Ekron shall be rooted up.
{2:5} Wo! to the inhabitants of the region of the sea, the nation of the Cherethites: the word of Jehovah is upon you, O Canaan, the land of the rovers, and I destroyed thee from none inhabiting.
{2:6} And the region of the sea was a dwelling, and a cutting off of the shepherds and sheepfolds.
{2:7} And the region was for the remnant of the house of Judah; upon them they shall feed: in the houses of Ashkelon they shall lie down in the evening: for Jehovah their God shall review them, and turn back their captivity.
{2:8} I heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the sons of Ammon which they reproached my people, and they will magnify against their border.
{2:9} For this. I live, says Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, for Moab shall be as Sodom, and the sons of Ammon as Gomorrah, the possession of the thorn-bush and salt-pits, and a desolation even to forever: the remnant of my people shall plunder them, and the rest of my nation shall inherit them.
{2:10} This to them for their pride, for they reproached and they will magnify against the people of Jehovah of armies.
{2:11} God being terrible to them, for he made lean all the gods of the earth; and they shall worship to him each from his place, all the isles of the nations.
{2:12} Also ye Cushites, they being wounded by my sword.
{2:13} And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and he will destroy Assur; and he will set Nineveh for a desolation, a dryness as the desert.
{2:14} And the flocks lay down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: also the pelican, also the hedgehog shall lodge in her capitals; a voice shall sing in the window; desolation in the threshold: for the cedar was naked.
{2:15} This the exulting city dwelling confidently, saying in her heart, I, and none besides me. How was she for a desolation, a piece of lying down for the beast! all passing by her shall hiss and wave his hand.
{3:1} Wo! to the wonderful and oppressing city being redeemed.
{3:2} She heard not to the voice: she received not instruction; she trusted not in Jehovah; she drew not near to her God.
{3:3} Her chiefs in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges evening wolves; they laid not up for the morning.
{3:4} Her prophets vain-glorious men of treacheries: her priests defiled the holy place, they violated the law.
{3:5} Jehovah is just in her midst; he will not do iniquity: in morning by morning he will give his judgment to the light, he as not wanting; and the evil will not know shame.
{3:6} I cut off the nations: their pinnacles were desolate: I laid waste their streets from none passing by; their cities were destroyed from not a man, from not an inhabitant.
{3:7} I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; and her dwelling shall not be cut off, all that I reviewed over her but they rose early, they corrupted all their doings.
{3:8} For this, wait for me, says Jehovah, to the day of my rising up for a testimony: for my judgment is to assemble the nations for my gathering the kingdoms to pour upon them my wrath, all the burning of mine anger: for in the fire of my jealousy all the earth shall be devoured.
{3:9} For then I will turn to the peoples a purified lip, for all to call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with one shoulder.
{3:10} From beyond to the rivers of Cush incense, the daughter of my dispersed shall bring my gifts.
{3:11} In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doing which thou didst transgress against me: for then will I remove from the midst of thee those exulting in thy pride, and thou shalt no more add to be elevated in my holy mountain.
{3:12} And I left in the midst of thee a humble and weak people, and they trusted in the name of Jehovah.
{3:13} The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, and they shall not speak falsehood: and in their mouth shall not be found a tongue of deceit: for they shall feed and lie down, and none terrifying.
{3:14} Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion; cry with a loud voice, O Israel; rejoice and exult with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
{3:15} Jehovah removed thy judgments, be turned away thine enemy: the king of Israel, Jehovah in the midst of thee: thou shalt no more see evil.
{3:16} In that day he will say to Jerusalem, Thou shalt not fear: O Zion, thy hands shall not be slack.
{3:17} Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee: the strong one will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will be silent in his love, he will exult over thee with rejoicing.
{3:18} I will assemble those grieved for the appointment, who were from thee, the lifting up upon it a reproach.
{3:19} Behold me doing all for sake of thee in that time: and I saved her halting, and her being driven out I will gather; and I set them for a praise and for a name in every land of their shame.
{3:20} In that time I will bring you, and in the time of my gathering you: for I will give you for a name and for a praise among all peoples of the earth, in my turning your captivity before your eyes, said Jehovah.
