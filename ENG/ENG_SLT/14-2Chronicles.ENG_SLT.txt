{1:1} And Solomon son of David will be strengthened over his kingdom, and Jehovah his God with him, and he will magnify him to above.
{1:2} And Solomon will say to all Israel, to the chiefs of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince to all Israel, the heads of the fathers.
{1:3} And Solomon and all the convocation with him will go to the height which is in Gibeon; for there was the tent of appointment of God, which Moses servant of Jehovah made in the desert.
{1:4} But the ark of God David brought up from the city of forests in David's preparing for it: for he spread out for It a tent in Jerusalem.
{1:5} And the altar of brass which Bezaleel, son of Uri, son of Hur, made, he set before the dwelling of Jehovah: and Solomon and the convocation will seek it.
{1:6} And Solomon will go up there upon the altar of brass before Jehovah, which is at the tent of appointment, and he will bring up a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.
{1:7} In that night God was seen to Solomon, and he will say to him, Ask what I shall give to thee.
{1:8} And Solomon will say to God, Thou didst great mercy with David my father, and hast caused me to reign in his stead.
{1:9} Now, O Jehovah God, shall thy word with David my father be firm: for thou didst cause me to reign over a people a multitude as the dust of the earth.
{1:10} Now wilt thou give to me wisdom and knowledge, and I shall go out before this people, and come in: for who shall judge this thy great people?
{1:11} And God will say to Solomon, Because this was with thy heart, and thou askedst not riches, treasures and honor, and the soul of those hating thee, and also many days thou askedst not, and thou wilt ask for thee wisdom and knowledge that thou shalt judge my people that I caused thee to reign over them:
{1:12} Wisdom and knowledge are given to thee; and riches and treasures and honor will I give to thee which was not thus to the kings that were before thee; and after thee it shell not be thus.
{1:13} And Solomon will come to the height which is in Gibeon to Jerusalem from before the tent of appointment, and he will reign over Israel.
{1:14} And Solomon will gather together chariots and horsemen: and there will be to him a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he will deposit them in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem.
{1:15} And the king will give the silver and the gold in Jerusalem as stones, and he gave cedars as sycamore trees which are in the low country for multitude.
{1:16} And the going forth of horses which was to Solomon from Egypt, and a collection of merchants of the king will take a collection at a price.
{1:17} And they will go up and bring forth from Egypt a chariot for six hundred of silver, and a horse for fifty and a hundred: and thus for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Aram, by their hand will they bring forth.
{2:1} And Solomon will say to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.
{2:2} And Solomon will number seventy thousand men to carry, and eighty thousand men to hew in the mountain; and they superintending over them three thousand six hundred.
{2:3} And Solomon will send to Huram king of Tyre, saying, According as thou didst with David my father, and thou wilt send to him cedars to build for him a house to dwell in it.
{2:4} Behold, I build a house to the name of Jehovah my God, to consecrate to him, to burn incense before him, incense of spices, and the arrangement always, and the burnt-offerings for morning and for evening, for the Sabbaths and for the new moons, and for the appointments of Jehovah our God. Forever this upon Israel.
{2:5} And the house that I build is great: for great our God above all gods.
{2:6} For who shall retain power to build for him a house? for the heavens and the heavens of the heavens shall not contain him: and who am I who shall build to him a house but to burn incense before him?
{2:7} And now send to me a man wise to work in gold and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and cerulean purple, and knowing to engrave engravings with the wise which are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, which David my father prepared.
{2:8} And send to me cedar trees and cypresses, and algum trees from Lebanon: for I knew that thy servants are knowing to cut trees of Lebanon; and behold, my servants with thy servants,
{2:9} And to prepare for me woods for multitude: for the house that I build is great and wonderful.
{2:10} And behold, to those hewing, to those cutting woods, wheat, the beatings out to thy servants twenty thousand cors, and barley, twenty thousand cors, and wine, twenty thousand baths, and oil, twenty thousand baths.
{2:11} And Huram king of Tyre will say in writing, and he will send to Solomon, In Jehovah's loving his people he gave thee king over them.
{2:12} And Huram will say, Praised be Jehovah God of Israel, who made the heavens and the earth, who gave to David the king a wise son, knowing intelligence and understanding, who will build a house to Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.
{2:13} And now I sent a wise man knowing understanding to Huram my father,
{2:14} The son of a woman from the daughters of Dan, and his father a man of Tyre knowing to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stones, and in woods, in purple, in cerulean purple, and in byssus, and in crimson; and to engrave every engraving, and to invent every work of art which shall be given to him, with thy wise ones, and the wise of my lord David thy father.
{2:15} And now the wheat and the bailey and the oil and the wine which my lord said he will send to his servants;
{2:16} And we will cut woods from Lebanon, according to all thy need: and we will bring them to thee in floats upon the sea of Joppa; and thou shalt bring them up to Jerusalem.
{2:17} And Solomon will number all the men, the strangers which are in the land of Israel, after the numbering which David his father numbered them; and they will be found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
{2:18} And he will make from them seventy thousand to carry, and eighty thousand hewing in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred superintending to cause the people to work.
{3:1} And Solomon will begin to build the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem in mount Moriah, which was seen to David his father in the place which David prepared in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

{4:1} And he will make an altar of brass, twenty cubits its length, and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten cubits its height.
{4:2} And he will make the molten sea ten by the cubit from its lip to its lip, rounded round about; and five by the cubit its height; and a cord thirty by the cubit will surround it round about.

{4:17} In the circuit of Jordan the king will cast them, in the thicknesses of the land between Succoth and between Zeredathah.
{4:18} And Solomon will make all these vessels for a great multitude: for the weight of the brass was not searched out.
{4:19} And Solomon will make all the vessels, those of the house of God, and the altar of gold, and the tables, and upon them the bread of the faces;

{5:2} Then Solomon will convoke together the old men of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers to the sons of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the city of David; it is Zion.
{5:3} And all the men of Israel will be convoked together to the king in this festival of the seventh month.
{5:4} And all the old men of Israel will come; and the Levites will lift up the ark.

{5:8} And the cherubims will be spreading forth the wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims will cover over the ark, and over its bars from above.
{5:9} And they will extend the bars, and the heads of the bars will be seen from the ark upon the face of the oracle; and they will not be seen without And it will be there even to this day.
{5:10} Nothing in the ark only the two tables which Moses gave in Horeb when Jehovah cut out with the sons of Israel in their coming out of Egypt.
{5:11} And it will be in the coming forth of the priests from the holy place, (for all the priests being found were consecrated not to watch to the divisions:
{5:12} And the Levites, those singing to all them to Asaph, to Heman, to Jeduthun, and to then some and their brethren; being clothed with byssus, with cymbals and with lyres and harps, standing from the sunrising to the altar, and with them the priests to a hundred and twenty, trumpeting with trumpets:)
{5:13} And it will be as one to those trumpeting and to those singing, to cause one voice to be heard to praise and to confess to Jehovah; and when lifting up the voice with the trumpets and with the cymbals and with the instruments of the song, and with praising to Jehovah, For he is good, for his mercy is forever: and the house was filled with a cloud, the house of Jehovah;
{5:14} And the priests were not able to stand to serve from the face of the cloud, for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of God.
{6:1} Then said Solomon, Jehovah said to dwell in thick clouds.
{6:2} And I built a house of habitation for thee, and a foundation for thy dwelling forever.
{6:3} And the king will turn his face, and will bless all the convocation of Israel: and all the convocation of Israel stood.
{6:4} And he will say, Praised be Jehovah the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and filled up with his hands, saying,
{6:5} From the day, that I brought forth my people from the land of Egypt I chose not in a city from all the tribes of Israel to build a house for my name to be there; and I chose not in man to be leader over my people Israel.
{6:6} And I will choose in Jerusalem for my name to be there; and I will choose in David to be over my people Israel.
{6:7} And it will be with the heart of David my father to build a house to the name of Jehovah God of Israel.
{6:8} And Jehovah will say to David my father, Because it was with thy heart to build a house to my name, thou didst well that it was with thy heart.
{6:9} But thou shalt not build the house; for thy son coming forth from thy loins, he shall build the house to my name.
{6:10} And Jehovah will raise up the word that he spake: and I shall rise up instead of David my father, and sit upon the throne of Israel according to the word of Jehovah; and I will build the house to the name of Jehovah God of Israel.
{6:11} And there I will set the ark where is there the covenant of Jehovah which he cut out with the sons of Israel.
{6:12} And he will stand before the altar of Jehovah before all the convocation of Israel, and he will spread forth his hands:
{6:13} For Solomon made a platform of brass, and he will give it in the midst of the terrace; five cubits its length, and five cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height: and he will stand upon it, and he will bend upon his knees before all the convocation of Israel, and he will spread forth his hands to the heavens,
{6:14} And he will say, O Jehovah God of Israel, not as thee a God in the heavens and in the earth, watching the covenant and the mercy to thy servants going before thee with all their heart:
{6:15} Who didst watch to thy servant David my father what thou spakest to him; and thou wilt speak with thy month, and with thy hand thou wilt fill up, as this day.
{6:16} And now Jehovah God of Israel, watch to thy servant David my father what thou spakest to him, saying, A man shall not be cut off to thee from before me sitting upon the throne of Israel; only if thy sons shall watch their way to go in my law according as thou wentest before me.
{6:17} And slow, O Jehovah God of Israel, thy word shall be firm which thou didst speak to thy servant, to David.
{6:18} For indeed will God dwell with man upon the earth? Behold, the heavens and the heavens of the heavens will not contain thee; much less this house which I built.
{6:19} Turn to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hear to the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prays before thee:
{6:20} For thine eye to be opened to this house day and night, to the place which thou saidst to put thy name there, to hear to the prayer which thy servant shall pray to this place.
{6:21} And hear to the supplications of thy servant, and thy people Israel, which they shall pray to this place: and thou wilt hear from the place of thy dwelling from the heavens; and thou heardest and forgave.
{6:22} If a man shall sin against his neighbor, and he lifted up an oath upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath coming before thine altar in this house;
{6:23} And wilt thou hear from the heavens, and do, and judge thy servants, to turn back to the unjust to give his way upon his head: and to justify the just one by giving to him according to his justice.
{6:24} And if thy people Israel shall be smitten before the enemy because they will sin against thee: and they turned back and confessed thy name, and prayed and made supplication before thee in this house;
{6:25} And thou wilt hear from the heavens, and forgive to the sin of thy people Israel, and turn them back to the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
{6:26} In shutting up the heavens and there was no rain, because they sinned against thee; if they prayed to this place, and confessed thy name, they shall turn back from their sin when thou wilt humble them.
{6:27} And wilt thou hear from the heavens and forgive to the sin of thy servants, and thy people Israel? For thou wilt teach them to the good way which they shall go in it; and give rain upon the land which thou gavest to thy people for inheritance.
{6:28} If famine shall be in the land, if there shall be death, blasting and yellowness, the locust, and if there shall be the devourer; if the enemy shall press upon him in the land of his gates; every stroke and every disease:
{6:29} Every prayer, every supplication which shall be to every man, and to all thy people Israel, when each shall know his strobe and his griefs, and spreading forth his hands to this house;
{6:30} And wilt thou hear from the heavens the place of thy dwelling, and forgive, and give to each according to his ways, winch thou wilt know his heart? for thou alone knewest the heart of the sons of men.
{6:31} So that they shall fear thee to walk in thy ways all the days which they live upon the face of the land which thou gavest to our fathers.
{6:32} And also to the stranger which he is not from thy people Israel, and coming from a land far off for sake of thy great name, and thy strong hand, and thine arm stretched out; and they came and prayed to this house;
{6:33} And wilt thou hear from the heavens from the place of thy dwelling, and do according to all the stranger shall call to thee? so that all thy people shall know that thy name was called upon this house that I built.
{6:34} If thy people shall go forth to war against their enemies in the way which thou shalt send them, and they prayed to thee the way of this city which thou didst choose in it, and the house that I built to thy name;
{6:35} And hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and do their judgment.
{6:36} If they shall sin against thee, (for no man which shall not sin) and thou wert angry with them, and gavest them before the face of the enemy, and they taking them captive carried them captive to a land afar off or near;
{6:37} And they turned back to their heart in the land which they were carried away captive there, and they turned back and made supplication to thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We sinned, we were perverse, and we did evil;
{6:38} And they turned back to thee with all their heart and with all their soul into the land of their captivity where they carried them away captive; and they prayed the way of their land which thou gavest to their fathers, and the city which thou choosest, and to the house that I built for thy name.
{6:39} And thou heardest from the heavens from the place of thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplications; and do their judgment, and forgive to thy people who sinned against thee.
{6:40} Now, my God, shall thine eyes now be opened and thine ears attending to the prayer of this place.
{6:41} And now arise, O Jehovah God, to thy rest, thou, and the ark of thy strength: thy priests, O Jehovah God, shall be clothed with salvation, and thy merciful ones shall rejoice in good.
{6:42} O Jehovah God, thou wilt not turn away the face of thy Messiah: remember for the mercies of David thy servant.
{7:1} And when Solomon finished to pray, and the fire will come down from the heavens and consume the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
{7:2} And the priests were not able to come in to the house of Jehovah, for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.
{7:3} And all the sons of Israel seeing in the fire coming down, and the glory of Jehovah upon the house, and they will bow down their faces to the earth upon the tesselated pavement, and they will worship and praise to Jehovah, for he is for his mercy is forever.
{7:4} And the king and all the people sacrificed sacrifices before Jehovah.
{7:5} And king Solomon will sacrifice a Sacrifice of oxen, twenty and two thousand; and sheep, a hundred and twenty thousand. And the king and all the people will consecrate the house of God.
{7:6} And the priests standing over their watches: and the Levites with instruments of song of Jehovah which David the king made to praise to Jehovah, for forever his mercy in David's praising by their hand; and the priests trumpeting before them, and all Israel standing.
{7:7} And Solomon will consecrate the midst of the enclosure which was before the house of Jehovah, for he did there the burnt-offerings and the fat of the peace, for the altar of brass which Solomon made was not able to contain the burnt-offering and the gift and the fat.
{7:8} And Solomon will do the festival in this time seven days, and all Israel with him, a great convocation, from the going in of Hamath even to the torrent of Egypt.
{7:9} And they will do in the eighth day a restraint: for they did the consecration of the altar, seven days; and the festival, seven days.
{7:10} And in the twenty and third to the seventh month he sent the people to their tents rejoicing and good of heart for the good that Jehovah did to David and to Solomon and to Israel his people.
{7:11} And Solomon will finish the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king: and all coming upon the heart of Solomon to do in the house of Jehovah, and in his house, he prospered.
{7:12} And Jehovah will be seen to Solomon in the night, and he will say to him, I heard thy prayer, and I chose in this place for me for a house of sacrifice.
{7:13} If I shall shut up the heavens and there shall not be rain, and if I shall command upon the locust to consume the land, and if I shall send death upon my people;
{7:14} And if my people which my name was called upon them shall be humbled and pray and seek my face, and turn back from their evil ways; and I will hear from the heavens and forgive to their sin, and I will heal their land.
{7:15} Now shall mine eyes be opened, and mine ears attending to the prayer of this place.
{7:16} And now I chose and I consecrated this house for my name to be there even to forever: and mine eyes and my heart were there all the days.
{7:17} And thou, if thou wilt go before me as David thy father went, and to do according to all that I commanded thee, and my law and my judgment thou shalt watch:
{7:18} And I set up the throne of thy kingdom according as I cut out to David thy father, saying, There shall not be cut off to thee a man ruling over Israel.
{7:19} And if ye shall turn away and forsake my laws and my covenant which I gave before you, and ye went and served other gods and worshiped to them;
{7:20} And I plucked them up from my land which I gave to them; and this house which I consecrated to my name I will cast from my face, and I will give it for a parable and for a derision among all peoples.
{7:21} And this house which was high shall astonish to every one passing by it; and saying, For what did Jehovah thus to this land and to this house?
{7:22} And they said, Because they forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers who brought them forth from the land of Egypt; and they will lay hold upon other gods and worship to them, and serve them: for this he brought upon them all this evil.
{8:1} And it will be from the end of twenty years, which Solomon built the house of Jehovah and his house,
{8:2} And the cities which Huram gave to Solomon, Solomon built them, and he will cause the sons of Israel to dwell there.
{8:3} And Solomon will go to Hamath-Zobah and he will lay hold upon it.
{8:4} And he will build Tadmor in the desert, and all the cities of the stores which he built in Hamath.
{8:5} And he will build the house of the hollow the high, and the house of the hollow the low, fortified cities, the walls, doors, and bar:
{8:6} And Baalath and all the cities of the stores which were to Solomon, and all the cities of the chariots, and the cities of the horsemen, and all the desire of Solomon which he delighted to build in Jerusalem and Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
{8:7} All the people being left from the Hittites and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites and the Jebusites, which they were not from Israel,
{8:8} From their sons who were left after them in the land which the sons of Israel consumed them not, and Solomon will bring them up for tribute even to this day.
{8:9} And from the sons of Israel which Solomon gave not for servants for his work, for they the men of war and the chiefs of his thirds, and chiefs of his chariots and his horsemen.
{8:10} And these the chiefs of the prefects which were to king Solomon, fifty and two hundred ruling over the people.
{8:11} And the daughter of Pharaoh, Solomon brought up from the city of David to the house which he built for her: for he said, The wife to me shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, for they are holiness which to them came the ark of Jehovah.
{8:12} Then Solomon brought up burnt-offerings to Jehovah upon the altar of Jehovah which he built before the porch
{8:13} And in the word of a day in a day to bring up according to the commands of Moses for the Sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the appointments, three times in the year, in the festival of unleavened, in the festival of sevens, and in the festival of the tents.
{8:14} And he will set up according to the judgment of David his father the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their watches, to praise and to serve before the priests for the word of a day in its day; and the gate-keepers in their divisions, to gate and gate: for thus the command of David the man of God.
{8:15} And they departed not from the command of the king concerning the priests and the Levites for every word and for the treasures.
{8:16} And all the work of Solomon will be prepared even to the day of the founding the house of Jehovah and even till its finishing. The house of Jehovah was completed.
{8:17} Then Solomon went to Ezion-Geber and to Eloth upon the lip of the sea in the land of Edom.
{8:18} And Huram will send to him by the hand of his servants, ships, and servants knowing the sea; and they will go with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and they will take from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold and bring to king Solomon.
{9:1} And the queen Sheba heard the hearing of Solomon, and she will come to try Solomon with enigmas in Jerusalem, with very weighty power, and camels lifting up spices, and gold, for multitude, and precious stone: and she will come to Solomon and speak with him all which was with her heart.
{9:2} And Solomon will announce to her all her words, and not a word was hidden from Solomon which he announced not to her.
{9:3} And the queen of Sheba will see the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he built,
{9:4} And the food of his table, and the seat of his servants, and the standing of those waiting upon him, and their clothing, and his cup-bearers and their clothing, and his ascent that he went up to the house of Jehovah; and no more spirit was in her.
{9:5} And she will say to the king, The word was truth which I heard in my land concerning thy words, and concerning thy wisdom:
{9:6} And I believed not their words till when I came, and mine eyes will see: and behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not announced to me: thou didst add upon the hearing which I heard.
{9:7} Happy thy men, and happy thy servants, these standing before thee always, and hearing thy wisdom.
{9:8} Blessed shall be Jehovah thy God who delighted in thee to give thee upon his throne for king to Jehovah thy God: in thy God loving Israel to cause him to stand forever, and he will give thee for king over them to do judgment and justice.
{9:9} And she will give to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices for a multitude greatly, and precious stone: and there was not as that spice which queen Sheba gave to king Solomon.
{9:10} And also the servants of Huram; and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir, brought almug trees and precious stone.
{9:11} And the king will make the almug trees stair-cases to the house of Jehovah, and to the house of the king, and harps and lyres for those singing: and none were seen as they in the land of Judah.
{9:12} And king Solomon gave to queen Sheba all her desire which she asked, besides what she brought to the king. And she will turn and go to her land, she and her servants.
{9:13} And the weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year will be six hundred and sixty six talents of gold;
{9:14} Besides from men reconnoitering and those trafficking, bringing. And all the kings of Arabia and the prefects of the land bringing gold and silver to Solomon.
{9:15} And king Solomon will make two hundred shields of beaten gold: six hundred of beaten gold he will bring up upon one shield.
{9:16} And three hundred shields of beaten sold: three hundred of gold he will bring up upon one shield. And the king will give them into the house of the forest of Lebanon.
{9:17} And the king will make a great throne of ivory, and he will overlay it with pure gold.
{9:18} And six steps to the throne, and a footstool in gold holding fast to the throne, and hands from hence and from thence, upon the place of the seat, and two lions standing near the hands.
{9:19} And twelve lions standing there upon the six steps, from hence and from thence. There was not made thus to any kingdom.
{9:20} And all the vessels of drinking of king Solomon, gold; and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon, of shut up gold: no silver was reckoned in the days of Solomon for any thing.
{9:21} For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of huram: once to three years will come the ships to Tarshish, lifting up gold and silver and ivory, and apes and peacocks.
{9:22} And king Solomon will be Magnified above all the kings of the earth for riches and wisdom.
{9:23} And all the kings of the earth seeking the face of Solomon to hear his wisdom that God gave in his heart.
{9:24} And they bringing each his gift, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and garments, weapons and spices, horses and mules, the word of a year in a year.
{9:25} And there will be to Solomon font thousand stalls of horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he will place them in the chariot cities, and with the king in Jerusalem.
{9:26} And he will be ruling over all the kingdoms from the river and even to the land of the rovers, and even to the bound of Egypt.
{9:27} And the king will give silver as stones in Jerusalem, and he gave cedars as sycamore trees in the low country, for multitude.
{9:28} And bringing forth horses from Egypt to Solomon, and from all lands.
{9:29} And the rest of the words of Solomon, the first and the last, are they not written upon the words of Nathan the prophet, and upon the prophesy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
{9:30} And Solomon will reign in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
{9:31} And Solomon will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son, will reign in his stead.
{10:1} And Rehoboam will go to Shechem: for to Shechem came all Israel to make him king.
{10:2} And it will be as Jeroboam son of Nebat heard, and he in Egypt where he fled from the face of Solomon the king, and Jeroboam will turn back from Egypt.
{10:3} And they will send and call to him. And Jeroboam will come, and all Israel, and they will speak to Rehoboam, saying,
{10:4} Thy father hardened our yoke: and now lighten from the hard servitude of thy father, and from his heavy yoke which he gave upon us, and we will serve thee.
{10:5} And he will say to them, Yet three days and turn back to me. And the people will go.
{10:6} And king Rehoboam will consult with the old men who were standing before Solomon his father in his being alive, saying, How counsel ye me to turn back word to this people?
{10:7} And they will speak to him, saying, If thou wilt be for good to this people, and pleasing them, and speak to them good words, and they were servants to thee all the days.
{10:8} And he will forsake the counsel of the old men which they counseled, and he will consult the children which grew up with him, standing before him.
{10:9} And he will say to them, What counsel ye? and we will turn back word to this people who spake to me, saying, Lighten from the yoke which thy father gave upon us.
{10:10} And the children which grew up with him will speak with him, saying, Thou shalt say thus to the people who spake to thee, saying, Thy father made heavy our yoke, and lighten thou from us; thus shalt thou say to them, My little finger thick above my father's loins.
{10:11} And now my father loaded upon you a heavy yoke, and I will add upon your yoke: my father corrected you with whips, and I with scorpions.
{10:12} And Jeroboam will come, and all the people, to Rehoboam, in the third day, as the king spake, saying, Turn back to me in the third day.
{10:13} And the king will answer them hard; and king Rehoboam will forsake the counsel of the old men.
{10:14} And he will speak to them according to the counsel of the children, saying, My father made heavy your yoke, and I will add upon it: my father corrected you with whips, and I with scorpions.
{10:15} And the king heard not to the people, for the turn was of God, so that Jehovah raised up his word which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
{10:16} And all Israel saw that the king heard not to them, and the people will turn back to the king, saying, What portion to us in David? And no inheritance in the son of Jesse: each to thy tents, O Israel: now see thy house, O David. And all Israel will go to his tents.
{10:17} And the sons of Israel dwelling in the cities of Judah, and Rehoboam will reign over them.
{10:18} And king Rehoboam will send Hadoram who was over the tribute; and the sons of Israel will stone upon him, and he will die. And king Rehoboam strengthened himself to go up into the chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
{10:19} And Israel will break with the house of David even to this day.
{11:1} And Rehoboam will come to Jerusalem, and he will convoke together the house of Judah and Benjamin a hundred and eighty thousand chosen, making war to fight with Israel, to turn back the kingdom to Rehoboam.
{11:2} And the word of Jehovah will be to Shemaiah a man of God, saying,
{11:3} Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
{11:4} Thus said Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, and ye shall not war with your brethren: turn ye back each to his house: for from me was this word. And they will hear the words of Jehovah and turn back from going against Jeroboam.
{11:5} And Rehoboam will dwell in Jerusalem, and he will build cities for fortification in Judah.
{11:6} And he will build the house of bread, and the place of ravenous beasts, and the pitching of tents,
{11:7} And the house of the rock, and the branches, and the justice of the people,
{11:8} And the wine-press, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
{11:9} And the two mounds, and Lachish, and Azekah,
{11:10} And Zorah, and Ajalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, cities of fortifications.
{11:11} And he will strengthen the fortifications, and he will give in them leaders and treasures of food, and oil, and wine.
{11:12} And in every city and city, shields and spears, and he will strengthen them very greatly, and there will be to him Judah and Benjamin.
{11:13} And the priests and the Levites which were in all Israel stood forth to him from all their bound.
{11:14} For the Levites forsook their areas and their possession, and they will come to Judah and to Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons rejected them from being priest to Jehovah:
{11:15} And he will set up to him priests for the heights, for the wood-demons, and for the calves which he made.
{11:16} And after them from all the tribes of Israel those giving their heart to seek Jehovah God of Israel came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah the God of their fathers.
{11:17} And they will strengthen the kingdom of Judah, and make firm Rehoboam son of Solomon, for three years: for they went in the way of David and Solomon for three years.
{11:18} And Rehoboam will take to him a wife, Mahalath, daughter of Jerimoth, son of David, and Abihail daughter of Eliab son of Jesse;
{11:19} And she will bear to him sons, Jeush and Shemariah, and Zaham.
{11:20} And after her he took Maacah, daughter of Absalom; and she will bear to him Abijah and Attai, and Ziza and Shelomith.
{11:21} And Rehoboam will love Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines; and he will beget twenty and eight sons, and sixty daughters.
{11:22} And Rehoboam will set up for head, Abijah son of Maacah for leader over his brethren: in order to make him king.
{11:23} And he will understand, and he will spread from all his sons to all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to all the cities of fortifications: and he will give to them food for multitude. And he will ask for a multitude of wives.
{12:1} And it will be when Rehoboam established the kingdom, and when he strengthened himself, he forsook the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him.
{12:2} And it will be in the fifth year to king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, (for they transgressed against Jehovah,)
{12:3} With a thousand and two hundred chariots, and with sixty thousand horsemen: and no number to the people that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, Sukkims, and the Cushites.
{12:4} And he will take fortified cities which were to Judah and he will come even to Jerusalem.
{12:5} And Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and the chiefs of Judah who were gathered together to Jerusalem from the face of Shishak, and he will say to them, Thus said Jehovah, Ye forsook me, and I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
{12:6} And the chiefs of Israel, and the king, will humble themselves; and they will say, Jehovah is just.
{12:7} And in Jehovah's seeing that they humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah was to Shemaiah, saying, They humbled themselves; I will not destroy them, and I gave to them as a little for deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
{12:8} For they shall be to him for servants; and they shall know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the lands.
{12:9} And Shishak king of Egypt will come up against Jerusalem, and will take the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the house of the king; he took the whole: and he will take the shields of gold that Solomon made.
{12:10} And king Rehoboam will make instead of them, shields of brass, and he deposited upon the hand of the chiefs of the runners, those watching the entrance of the king's house.
{12:11} And it will be as often as the king came into the house of Jehovah the runners came and lifted them up and turned them back to the chamber of the runners.
{12:12} And in his humbling himself, the anger of Jehovah turned back from him, and not to destroy to the end: and also in Judah was good words.
{12:13} And king Rehoboam will strengthen himself in Jerusalem, and he will reign: for the son of forty and one years was Rehoboam in his reigning, and seventeen years he reigned in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah chose to set his name there from all the tribes of Israel. And the name of his mother, Naamah the Ammonitess.
{12:14} And he will do evil, for he prepared not his heart to seek Jehovah.
{12:15} And the words of Rehoboam, the first and the last, are they not written in the words of Shemaiah the prophet, and Iddo the seeing for the enrolling? And wars of Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days.
{12:16} And Rehoboam will lie down with his fathers, and be buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son will reign in his stead.
{13:1} And in the eighteenth year to king Jeroboam, Abijah will reign over Judah.
{13:2} And three years he reigned in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother, Michaiah, daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. And war was between Abijah and Jeroboam.
{13:3} And Abijah will bind on the battle with the strength of the strong ones of war, four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam arranged the battle with him with eight hundred thousand, each chosen, strong of power.
{13:4} And Abijah will rise up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and he will say, Hear me, Jeroboam, and all Israel;
{13:5} Is it not to you to know that Jehovah God of Israel gave the kingdom to David over Israel forever, to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
{13:6} And Jeroboam son of Nebat servant of Solomon son of David, will rise up and will rebel against his lord.
{13:7} And vain men will gather together to him, sons of Belial; and they will strengthen themselves against Rehoboam son of Solomon; and Rehoboam being young and tender of heart, and he was not strong before them.
{13:8} And now ye saying to be strengthened before the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye a great multitude, and with you calves of gold which Jeroboam made for you for gods.
{13:9} Did ye not thrust out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron and the Levites? and ye will make to you priests according to the peoples of the lands, every one coming to fill his hand with a bullock, son of the cow, and seven rams; and he was priest to no God.
{13:10} And we, Jehovah is our God, and we forsook him not; and the priests serving to Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in the work:
{13:11} And burning to Jehovah the burnt-offering in the morning, in the morning, and in the evening, in the evening, and incense of spices, and the arrangement of bread upon the pure table; and the chandelier of gold and its lamps to burn in the evening, in the evening: for we watch the watches of Jehovah our God; and ye forsook him.
{13:12} And behold, with us God for head, and his priests and trumpets of loud noise to cry against you. O ye sons of Israel, ye shall not wage war with Jehovah God of your fathers, for ye shall not prosper.
{13:13} And Jeroboam turned about an ambush to come from behind them: and they will be before Judah, and the ambush from behind them.
{13:14} And Judah will turn, and behold, to them the war before and behind: and they will cry out to Jehovah and the priests trumpeting with the trumpets.
{13:15} And the men of Judah will shout: and it will be in the shouting of the men of Judah, and God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
{13:16} And the sons of Israel will flee from the face of Judah: and God will give them into their hand.
{13:17} And Abijah and his people will strike upon them a great blow: and there will fall wounded from Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
{13:18} And the sons of Israel will be subdued in that time, and the sons of Judah will be strong, for they relied upon Jehovah the God of their fathers.
{13:19} And Abijah will pursue after Jeroboam, and he will take cities from him, the house of God and its daughters, and Jeshanah and its daughters, and Ephraim and its daughters.
{13:20} And Jeroboam retained no more strength in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah will smite him and he will die.
{13:21} And Abijah will be strengthened, and he will take to him fourteen wives, and he will beget twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
{13:22} And the rest of the words of Abijah, and his ways, and his words, being written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.
{14:1} And Abijah will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in the city of David: and Asa his son will reign in his stead. In his days the land rested ten years.
{14:2} And Asa will do the good and the straight in the eyes of Jehovah his God:
{14:3} And he will remove the altars of the stranger, and the heights, and break the pillars, and cut down the images:
{14:4} And he will say to Judah to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commands.
{14:5} And he will remove from all the cities of Judah the heights and the images: and the kingdom will rest before him.
{14:6} And he will build cities of fortification in Judah: for the land rested, and not with him war in these years; for Jehovah gave rest to him.
{14:7} And he will say to Judah, We will build these cities, and surround a wall, and towers, doors and bars, and the land yet before us: for we sought Jehovah our God, and he will give to us rest from round about And they will build and prosper.
{14:8} And there will be to Asa an army lifting up the shield and spear, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and from Benjamin lifting up the shield and bending the bow, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these strong of power.
{14:9} And there will come forth against them Zerah the Cushite with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he will come even to Mareshah.
{14:10} And Asa will come forth before him, and they will arrange the battle in the valley of the watch-tower to Mareshah.
{14:11} And Asa will call to Jehovah his God, and he will say, O Jehovah, nothing with thee to help between many to those of no power: help us, O Jehovah our God, for upon thee we relied, and in thy name we came against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou our God; man shall not detain with thee.
{14:12} And Jehovah will smite the Cushites before Asa, and before Judah; and the Cushites will flee.
{14:13} And Asa will pursue them, and the people which were with him, even to the lodging-place: and there will fall from the Cushites to nothing being to them, for they were broken before Jehovah, and before his camp; and they will lift up exceeding much spoil.
{14:14} And they will strike all the cities round about the lodging-place; for the fear of Jehovah was upon them: and they will plunder all the cities; for much plunder was in them.
{14:15} And also tents of cattle they struck, and they will turn back sheep for multitude, and camels; and they will turn back to Jerusalem.
{15:1} And Azariah son of Oded, upon him was the spirit of God.
{15:2} And he will go forth before Asa, and say to him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; Jehovah is with you in your being with him; and if ye will seek him he will be found to you; and if ye will forsake him, he will forsake you.
{15:3} And many days to Israel for not a God of truth, and for no priest teaching, and for no law.
{15:4} And he will turn back in straits to him upon Jehovah God of Israel, and they will seek him and he will be found to them.
{15:5} And in these times no peace to him going out, and to him coming in, for much consternation upon all inhabiting the lands.
{15:6} And they dashed themselves, nation upon nation, and city upon city: for God disturbed them with all straits.
{15:7} And ye, be ye strong, and your hands shall not be relaxed; for there is a reward to your work.
{15:8} And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he strengthened himself, and he will put away the abominations from all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and from the cities which he took from mount Ephraim, and he will renew the altar of Jehovah which was before the porch of Jehovah.
{15:9} And he will gather all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them from Ephraim and Manasseh and from Simeon: for they fell to him from Israel for multitude in their seeing that Jehovah his God was with him.
{15:10} And they will gather together at Jerusalem in the third month, for the fifteenth year to the kingdom of Asa.
{15:11} And they will sacrifice to Jehovah in that day from the spoil they brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
{15:12} And they will come into a covenant to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
{15:13} And every one who will not seek for Jehovah God of Israel shall be put to death, from small and even to great, from man and even to woman.
{15:14} And they will swear to Jehovah with a great voice, and with shouting and with trumpets and with horns.
{15:15} And all Judah will rejoice at the oath: for with all their heart they sware, and with all their desire they sought him, and he will be found to them: and Jehovah will give rest to them from round about.
{15:16} And also Maachah, Asa's mother, the king removed her from queen because she made terror for a statue: and Asa will cut off her terror, and beat small, and burn in the torrent Kidron.
{15:17} And the heights were not removed from Israel: but the heart of Asa was complete all his days.
{15:18} And he will bring the holies of his father, and his holies, into the house of God, silver and gold and vessels.
{15:19} And war was not even to the thirty and fifth year to the kingdom of Asa.
{16:1} In the thirty and sixth year to the kingdom of Asa, Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and he will build Ramah, not to give him coming out and going in to Asa, king of Judah.
{16:2} And Asa will bring forth silver and gold from the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king, and he will send to the son of Hadad king of Aram, dwelling in Darmesek, saying,
{16:3} A covenant between me and between thee, and between my father and between thy father: behold, I sent to thee silver and gold; go break thy covenant with Baasha king of Israel, and he will go up from me.
{16:4} And the son of Hadad will hear to king Asa, and he will send chiefs of the armies which were with him against the cities of Israel; and they will strike Ijon and Dan and Abel-Maim, and all the stores of the cities of Naphtali.
{16:5} And it will be when Baasha heard, and he will desist from building Ramah, and cause his works to cease.
{16:6} And Asa the king took all Judah; and they will lift up the stones of Ramah, and its woods which Baasha built, and he will build with it Geba and Mizpeh.
{16:7} And in that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and he will say to him, In thy relying upon the king of Aram, and thou didst not rely upon Jehovah thy God, for this the power of the king of Aram escaped from thy hand.
{16:8} Were not the Cushites and the Lubims for an army for multitude, for chariots, and for horsemen to a great multitude? and in thy relying upon Jehovah he gave them into thy hand.
{16:9} For Jehovah, his eyes run to and fro in all the earth to strengthen himself with the perfected heart of them to him. Thou wert foolish for this that from now there is wars with thee.
{16:10} And Asa will be indignant to the seer, and he will give him to the house of the stocks, for he was in anger with him for this And Asa will oppress from the people in that time.
{16:11} And behold, the words of Am, the first and the last, behold them written upon the book of the kings to Judah and to Israel.
{16:12} And Asa in the thirty and ninth year to his kingdom will be diseased in his feet, his disease even to above: and also in his disease he sought not Jehovah but in physicians.
{16:13} And Asa will lie down with his fathers, and he will die in the year forty and one to his kingdom.
{16:14} And they will bury him in his graves which he digged for himself in the city of David, and they will lay him down upon the bed which was filled with spices and sorts seasoned with aromatics of work. And they will burn for him a great burning, even to vehemence.
{17:1} And Jehoshaphat his son will reign in his stead, and he will strengthen himself against Israel.
{17:2} And he will give an army in all the fortified cities of Judah, and he will give garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father took.
{17:3} And Jehovah will be with Jehoshaphat, for he went in the first ways of David his father, and he sought not for the Baals.
{17:4} For to the God of his father he sought, and in his commands he went, and not according to the works of Israel.
{17:5} And Jehovah will prepare the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah will give a gift to Jehoshaphat, and riches will be to him and honor for multitude.
{17:6} And his heart will be high in the ways of Jehovah: and yet more, he removed the heights and statues from Judah.
{17:7} And in the third year to his kingdom he sent to his chiefs to the son of power, and to the servant of Jehovah, and to him Remembered of Jehovah, and to the Gift of God, and to Who as God, to teach in the cities of Judah.
{17:8} And with them the Levites, him Heard of Jehovah, and The gift of Jehovah, and him Jehovah gave, and him God made, and The Watchful of Death, and him Jehovah gave, and the Lord Jehovah, and The Good of Jehovah, and The Good Lord Jehovah, Levites; and with them God will hear, and Jehovah exalted the priests.
{17:9} And they will teach in Judah, and with them the book of the law of Jehovah, and they will turn about in all the cities of Judah, and they will teach among the people.
{17:10} And the fear of Jehovah will be upon all the kingdoms of the lands that are round about Judah, and they warred not with Jehoshaphat.
{17:11} And from the rovers bringing a gift to Jehoshaphat, and silver of tribute; also the Arabians bringing to him flocks, seven thousand, and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.
{17:12} And it will be Jehoshaphat went and was great even to above; and he will build fortresses in Judah, and cities of stores.
{17:13} And much work was to him in the cities of Judah: and the men of war strong of power in Jerusalem.
{17:14} And these their reviewing for the house of their fathers: to Judah the chiefs of thousands; Pleasure the chief, and with him strong ones of power, three hundred thousand.
{17:15} And upon his hand, Jehovah gave the chief, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand.
{17:16} And upon his hand Jehovah lifted up, son of The remembered, he volunteering to Jehovah: and with him two hundred thousand strong of power.
{17:17} And from Benjamin: him God knew, strong of power; and with him those bending the bow and the shield, two hundred thousand.
{17:18} And upon his hand him Jehovah gave, and with him a hundred and eighty thousand armed for war.
{17:19} These serving the king, besides which the king gave in the fortified cities in all Judah.
{18:1} And there will be to Jehoshaphat riches and honor for multitude, and he will contract affinity by marriage to Ahab.
{18:2} And he will go down at the end of years to Ahab to Shomeron. And Ahab will sacrifice to him sheep and oxen for multitude, and to the people which are with him, and he will stimulate him to go up to Ramoth-Gilead.
{18:3} And Ahab king of Israel will say to Jehoshaphat king of Judah. Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-Gilead? And he will say to him, As me, as thou; as thy people, my people; and with thee in war.
{18:4} And Jehoshaphat will say to the king of Israel, Seek now according to the day the word of Jehovah.
{18:5} And the king of Israel will gather together the prophets, four hundred men, and he will say to them, Shall we go to Ramoth-Gilead to war, or shall I desist? And they will say, Go up, and God will give into the hand of the king.
{18:6} And Jehoshaphat will say, Is there not yet more a prophet to Jehovah, and we will seek from him?
{18:7} And the king of Israel will say to Jehoshaphat, Yet one man to seek Jehovah from him: and I hated him, for he prophesies not to me for good, but all his days for evil: he is Micaiah son of Imlah. And Jehoshaphat will say, The king shall not say thus.
{18:8} And the king of Israel will call for one eunuch, and say, Hasten Micaiah son of Imlah.
{18:9} And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sitting each upon his throne, being clothed in garments, and sitting in the area of the door of the gate of Shomeron: and all the prophets prophesying before them.
{18:10} And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah will make for himself horns of iron; and he will say, Thus said Jehovah, With these shalt thou strike Aram even to finishing them.
{18:11} And all the prophets prophesying thus, saying, Go up to Ramoth-Gilead and prosper: and Jehovah gave into the hand of the king.
{18:12} And the messenger who went to call for Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets with one mouth good to the king; and now will thy word be as one of them, and speak good.
{18:13} And Micaiah will say, Jehovah lives, for what God shall say I shall speak it.
{18:14} And he will come to the king, and the king will say to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-Gilead to war, or shall I desist? And he will say, Go ye up and prosper, and they shall be given into your hand.
{18:15} And the king will say to him, Even how many times do I cause thee to swear that thou wilt speak to me only the truth in the name of Jehovah?
{18:16} And he will say, I saw all Israel being dispersed upon the mountains as sheep which not to them a shepherd: and Jehovah will say, No lords to these; they shall turn back each to his house in peace.
{18:17} And the king of Israel will say to Jehoshaphat, Did I not say to thee, He will not prophesy good to me, but for evil?
{18:18} And he will say, Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah; I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the army of the heavens standing upon his right and his left.
{18:19} And Jehovah will say, Who will persuade Ahab king of Israel, and he shall go up and fall in Ramoth-Gilead? And this will say, saying, according to this, and this, saying according to this.
{18:20} And a spirit will come forth and stand before Jehovah, and say, I will persuade. And Jehovah will say, In what?
{18:21} And he will say, I will go forth and be for a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets. And he will say, Thou shalt persuade, and also thou shalt prevail: go and do thus.
{18:22} And now behold Jehovah gave a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of these thy prophets, and Jehovah spake evil against thee.
{18:23} And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah, will draw near and strike Micaiah upon the cheek, and he will say, Which way passed the spirit of Jehovah from me to speak with thee?
{18:24} And Micaiah will say, Behold thee seeing in that day which thou shalt go to a chamber in a chamber to hide thyself.
{18:25} And the king of Israel will say, Take ye Micaiah and turn him back to Amon chief of the city, and to Joash son of the king;
{18:26} And say, Thus said the king, Put ye this in the house of the prison, and feed him with bread of oppression and water of oppression till my turning back in peace.
{18:27} And Micaiah will say, If turning back thou shalt turn back in peace, Jehovah spake not in me. And he will say, Hear, ye peoples, all of them.
{18:28} And the king of Israel will go up, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, to Ramoth-Gilead.
{18:29} And the king of Israel will say to Jehoshaphat, Disguising myself and going into the war; and thou, put on thy garments. And the king of Israel will disguise himself, and will go into the war.
{18:30} And the king of Aram commanded the chiefs of the chariots which were with him, saying, Ye shall not war with small and great, but with the king of Israel, him only.
{18:31} And it will be as the chiefs of the chariots, seeing Jehoshaphat, and they said, He is the king of Israel. And they will surround about him to wage war: and Jehoshaphat will cry out, and Jehovah helped him, and God stimulates them from him.
{18:32} And it will be in the chiefs of the chariots seeing that he was not the king of Israel, and they will turn back from after him.
{18:33} And a man drawing upon a bow to his fulness, and he will strike the king of Israel between the joints and between the coat of mail: and he will say to the driver, Turn thy hands and bring me out from the camp, for I was made sick.
{18:34} And the battle will go up in that day: and the king of Israel was made to stand in the chariot over against Aram till the evening: and he will die at the time of the going down of the sun.
{19:1} And Jehoshaphat king of Judah will turn back to his house in peace to Jerusalem.
{19:2} And Jehu son of Hanani the seer will go forth to his face, and say to king Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou love to help to the unjust, and to those hating Jehovah? and in this, wrath upon you from before Jehovah.
{19:3} But good words were found with thee, for thou didst burn the images from the land, and didst prepare heart to seek God.
{19:4} And Jehoshaphat will dwell in Jerusalem: and he will turn back and go forth among the people from the Well of the Oath, even to mount Ephraim; and he will turn them back to Jehovah the God of their fathers.
{19:5} And he will set up judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, to city and city;
{19:6} And he will say to the judges, See ye what ye do: for not for man shall ye judge, but for Jehovah; and he with you in the word of judgment.
{19:7} And now the fear of Jehovah shall be upon you: watch ye and do: for not iniquity with Jehovah our God, and lifting up of faces, and taking a gift.
{19:8} And also in Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat set up from the Levites and the priests, and from the heads to the fathers to Israel, for the judgment of Jehovah and for contention; and they will turn back to Jerusalem.
{19:9} And he will command upon them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of Jehovah, with faithfulness and with the whole heart.
{19:10} And every contention which shall come upon you from your brethren dwelling in their cities, between blood to blood, between law to command, to precepts and to judgments, and warn ye them and they shall not trespass against Jehovah, and wrath being upon you and upon your brethren: thus shall ye do and not trespass.
{19:11} And behold, Amariah the head priest over you for every word of Jehovah; and Zebadiah son of Ishmael the leader to the house of Judah, for every word of the king: and the scribes, the Levites, before you. Be strong and do, and Jehovah will be with the good.
{20:1} And it will be after this, the sons of Moab and the sons of Ammon came, and with them from the Ammonites against Jehoshaphat for war.
{20:2} And they will come and announce to Jehoshaphat, saying, A great multitude coming against thee from beyond the sea from Aram in Hazazon-Tamar; this the fountain of the kid.
{20:3} And Jehoshaphat will fear, and he will give his face to seek to Jehovah, and he will call a fast for all Judah.
{20:4} And Judah will gather together to seek from Jehovah; also from all the cities of Judah they came to seek Jehovah.
{20:5} And Jehoshaphat will stand in the convocation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah before the new enclosure.
{20:6} And he will say, O Jehovah God of our fathers, art thou not he the God in the heavens? and thou art ruling over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in thine hand power and strength, and none to stand with thee?
{20:7} Art thou not our God? Thou didst dispossess the inhabitants of this land from before thy people Israel, and thou wilt give it to the seed of Abraham thy beloved forever.
{20:8} And they will dwell in it, and build to thee in it a holy place to thy name, saying,
{20:9} If evil shall come upon us, the sword, judgment, and death and famine, we shall stand before this house and before thee, for thy name is upon this house, and we will cry to thee from our straits, and thou wilt hear, and thou wilt save.
{20:10} And now behold the sons of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, which thou gavest not to Israel to come against them in their coming out of the land of Egypt, for they turned away from them and destroyed them not;
{20:11} And behold them rewarding upon us to come to drive us out from thy possession which thou causedst us to possess.
{20:12} O our God, wilt thou not judge against them? for no power in us before this great multitude coming against us; and we shall not know what we shall do: for our eyes are upon thee.
{20:13} And all Judah standing before Jehovah, also their little ones, their wives and their sons.
{20:14} And Jahaziel, son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah the Levite from the sons of Asaph, upon him was the spirit of Jehovah in the midst of the convocation.
{20:15} And he will say, Attend all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou, king Jehoshaphat. Thus said Jehovah to you, Ye shall not fear, and ye shall not be terrified from the face of this great multitude; for not to you the battle but to God.
{20:16} To-morrow go ye down against them: behold them coming up in the ascent of brightness; and ye found them in the end of the valley before the desert of Jeruel.
{20:17} Not to you to war in this: set yourselves, stand ye, and see the salvation of Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Ye shall not fear, and ye shall not be terrified; to-morrow go ye forth before them, and Jehovah with you.
{20:18} And Jehoshaphat will bow down the face to the earth: and all Judah and those inhabiting Jerusalem fell before Jehovah to worship to Jehovah.
{20:19} And the Levites from the sons of the Kohathites, and from the sons of the Korhites, will rise up to praise to Jehovah the God of Israel with a great voice to above.
{20:20} And they will rise early in the morning and go forth to the desert of Tekoa: and in their going forth Jehoshaphat stood, and he will say, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabiting Jerusalem; Believe in Jehovah your God and ye shall be firm; believe in his prophets and prosper.
{20:21} And he will counsel to the people, and he will set up those singing to Jehovah, and those praising to the ornaments of holiness, in their going out before the strong, and saying, Confess ye to Jehovah; his mercy is forever.
{20:22} And in the time they began in rejoicing and praising, Jehovah gave ambushes against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, coming against Judah; and they will be smitten.
{20:23} For the sons of Ammon and Moab will stand up against those inhabiting mount Seir to utterly destroy and to cut off: and in their finishing upon those inhabiting Seir they helped each against his neighbor for destruction.
{20:24} And Judah came upon the watchtower to the desert, and they will look towards the multitude, and behold them corpses falling to the earth, and none escaping.
{20:25} And Jehoshaphat will come, and his people, to plunder their spoil, and they will find among them for multitude and possession, and corpses, and vessels of desires, and they will take away for themselves to not lifting up: and they will be three days plundering the spoil, for it was much.
{20:26} And in the fourth day they were convoked together to the valley of praise; for there they praised Jehovah: for this, they called the name of that place, The valley of praise, even to this day.
{20:27} And they will turn back every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat at their head, to turn back to Jerusalem with joy; for Jehovah gladdened them from their enemies.
{20:28} And they will come to Jerusalem with lyres and with harps and with trumpets to the house of Jehovah.
{20:29} And the terror of God will be upon all the kingdoms of the lands in their hearing that Jehovah warred with the enemies of Israel.
{20:30} And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat will rest: and God will give rest to him from round about.
{20:31} And Jehoshaphat will reign over Judah: the son of thirty and five years in his reigning, and twenty and five years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Azubah, daughter of Shilhi.
{20:32} And he will go in the way of his father Asa, and he removed not from it, doing the straight in the eyes of Jehovah.
{20:33} Only the heights were not removed: and yet the people prepared not their heart to the God of their fathers.
{20:34} And the rest of the words of Jehoshaphat, the first and the last, behold them written in the words of Jehu son of Hanani, who was made to go up upon the book of the kings of Israel.
{20:35} And after this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, he being unjust to do.
{20:36} And he will join himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they will make the ships in Ezion-Geber.
{20:37} And Eliezer son of Dodavah of Mareshah will prophesy against Jehoshaphat, saying, In thy joining thyself with Ahaziab, Jehovah broke thy works And the ships will be broken, and be hindered to go to Tarshish.
{21:1} And Jehoshaphat will lie down with his fathers, and be buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son will reign in his stead.
{21:2} And to him brethren, sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
{21:3} And their father will give to them many gifts to silver and to gold, and to precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: and he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, for he was the first-born.
{21:4} And Jehoram will rise up over the kingdom of his father, and he will strengthen himself, and he will kill all his brethren with the sword, and also from the chiefs of Israel.
{21:5} The son of thirty and two years was Jehoram in his reigning, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
{21:6} And he will go in the way of the kings of Israel as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was to him for wife: and he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
{21:7} And Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, for sake of the covenant which he cut out to David, and as he said to give to him a light and to his sons all the days.
{21:8} In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and they will cause a king to reign over them.
{21:9} And Jehoram will pass over with his chiefs, and all the chariots with him: and he will be rising by night, and he will strike Edom surrounding to him, and the chiefs of the chariots.
{21:10} And Edom will revolt from under the hand of Judah, even to this day. Then Libnah will revolt in that time from under his hand, for he forsook Jehovah the God of his fathers.
{21:11} Also he made heights in the mountains of Judah, and he will cause those inhabiting Jerusalem to commit fornication, and he will seduce Judah.
{21:12} And a writing will come to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus said Jehovah God of David thy father, Because that thou didst not go in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, and in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
{21:13} And thou wilt go in the way of the kings of Israel, and thou wilt cause Judah to commit fornication, and those inhabiting Jerusalem, according to the fornications of the house of Ahab, and also thou didst kill thy brethren of the house of thy father, being good above thee.
{21:14} Behold, Jehovah smote a great stroke upon thy people, and upon thy sons, and upon thy wives, and upon all thy possessions:
{21:15} And thou in great sicknesses in disease of thy bowels, till thy bowels shall come forth from the sickness days upon days.
{21:16} And Jehovah will rouse up against Jehoram the spirit of the rovers and the Arabians which were upon the hand of the Cushitea.
{21:17} And they will come up into Judah and rend it, and carry away captive all the possessions being found at the king's house, and also his sons and his wives; and there was not left to him a son except Jehoahaz the young of his sons.
{21:18} And after all this Jehovah smote him in his bowels with a sickness for no healing.
{21:19} And it will be to days from days, and according to the time of the going forth of the end to the days the second time, his bowels will go forth with his sickness: and he will die with evil sicknesses. And his people made not to him a burning as the burning of his fathers.
{21:20} The son of thirty and two was he in his reigning, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem; and he will go without desire: and they will bury him in the city of David, and not in the graves of the kings.
{22:1} And they inhabiting Jerusalem will make Ahaziah his young son king in his stead: for a troop coming with the Arabians to the camp killed all the first. And Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah will reign.
{22:2} The son of forty and two years was Ahaziah in his reigning, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Athaliah, daughter of Omri.
{22:3} Also he went in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was counseling him to do evil.
{22:4} And he will do the evil in the eyes of Jehovah as the house of Ahab: for they were were counseling to him after the death of his father, for destruction to him.
{22:5} Also he went in their counsel, and he will go with Jehoram son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael, king of Aram in Ramoth-Gilead: and the Syrians will strike Joram.
{22:6} And he will turn back to be healed in Jezreel because of the blows which they struck him in Ramoth in his warring with Hazael king of Aram. And Azariah son of Jehoram king of Judah will go down to see Jehoram son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
{22:7} And from God was the destruction of Ahaziah, for coming to Joram: and in his coming he went forth with Jehoram against Jehu son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah anointed him to cut off the house of Ahab.
{22:8} And it will be according to the judging of Jehu with the house of Ahab, and he will find the chiefs of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah serving to Ahaziah, and he will kill them.
{22:9} And he will seek Ahaziah, and they will take him, (and he being hid in Shomeron) and they will bring him to Jeku: and they will put him to death and bury him: For, they said, he is the son of Jehoshaphat who sought Jehovah with all his heart. And not to the house of Ahaziah to retain strength to the kingdom.
{22:10} And Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son died, and she will rise up and destroy all the seed of the kingdom to the house of Judah.
{22:11} And Jehoshabeath daughter of the king will take Joash son of Ahaziah, and she will steal him from the midst of the king's sons being slain, and give him and his nurse in a bed-chamber. And Jehoshabeath daughter of king Jehoram wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was sister of Ahaziah) will hide him from the face of Athaliah, and she slew him not.
{22:12} And he will be with them in the house of God being hid six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.
{23:1} And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and he will take chiefs of hundreds to Azariah son of Jeroham, and to Ishmael son of Jehohanan, and to Azariah son of Obed, and with Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and with Elishaphat son of Zichri, with him in covenant.
{23:2} And they will go about in Judah and gather the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the fathers to Israel, and they will come to Jerusalem.
{23:3} And all the convocation will cut out a covenant in the house of God with the king. And he will say to them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as Jehovah spake concerning the sons of David.
{23:4} This the word which ye shall do; the third of you coming in the Sabbath to the priests and to the Levites, to the gates of the thresholds;
{23:5} And the third in the king's house; and the third in the gate of the foundation: and all the people in the enclosures of the house of Jehovah.
{23:6} And they shall not come into the house of Jehovah except the priests and those serving to the Levites; they shall come in for they are holy: and all the people shall watch the watches of Jehovah.
{23:7} And the Levites surrounded the king round about, a man and his utensil in his hand; and he coming to the house shall be put to death: and be ye with the king in his coming in, and in his going out.
{23:8} And the Levites and all Judah will do according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded, and they will take each his men coming in on the Sabbath, with those coming out on the Sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the divisions.
{23:9} And Jehoiada the priest will give to the chiefs of hundreds, spears and shields and bucklers, which were to king David, which were in the house of God.
{23:10} And he will cause all the people to stand, and each his missile weapon in his hand, from the right shoulder of the house even to the left shoulder of the house, to the altar and to the house by the king round about.
{23:11} And they will bring forth the king's son, and they will give the diadem upon him, and the testimonies, and they will make him king. And Jehoiada and his sons will anoint him, and say, The king shall live.
{23:12} And Athaliah will hear the voice of the people running and praising the king, and she will come to the people in the house of Jehovah.
{23:13} And she will see, and behold, the king standing upon his standing in the coming in, and the chiefs and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoicing, and they clanged upon the trumpets; and those singing with instruments of the song, and those knowing to praise. And Athaliah will rend her garments and say, A conspiracy! a conspiracy!
{23:14} And Jehoiada the priest will bring forth the chiefs of hundreds reviewing the army, and he will say to them, Bring her forth from the house of the ranks: and he coming after her shall be slain with the sword: for the priest said, Ye shall not slay her in the house of Jehovah.
{23:15} And they will put hands upon her, and she will come to the entrance of the gate of horses of the king's house; and they will slay her there.
{23:16} And Jehoiada will cutout a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, to be for a people to Jehovah.
{23:17} And all the people will come to the house of Baal, and they will pull it down, and they broke his altars and his images, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
{23:18} And Jeboiada will set the oversight of the house of Jehovah in the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David distributed over the house of Jehovah, to bring up the burnt-offerings of Jehovah, as was written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with song, by the hands of David.
{23:19} And he will cause the gate-keepers to stand at the gates of the house of Jehovah, and the unclean shall not come in to all the word.
{23:20} And he will take the chiefs of hundreds, and the powerful, and those ruling over the people, and all the people of the land, and he will bring down the king from the house of Jehovah: and they will come in the midst of the highest gate of the king's house: and they will set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.
{23:21} And all the people of the land will rejoice: and the city rested; and they killed Athaliah with the sword.
{24:1} The son of seven years was Joash in his reigning, and forty years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Zibeah from the Well of the Oath.
{24:2} And Joash will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
{24:3} And Jehoiada will take to him two wives; and he will beget sons and daughters.
{24:4} And it will be after this it was with the heart of Joash to renew the house of Jehovah.
{24:5} And he will gather together the priests and the Levites, and say to them, Go ye forth to the cities of Judah and gather together from all Israel silver to strengthen the house of your God as often as year by year, and ye shall hasten to the word. And the Levites hastened not.
{24:6} And the king will call for Jehoiada the head, and say to him, Wherefore didst thou not seek out for the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the loan of Moses the servant of Jehovah, and of the convocation to Israel, to the tent of testimonies?
{24:7} For Athaliah doing evil; her sons broke asunder the house of God; and also all the holies of the house of Jehovah they made for the Baals.
{24:8} And the king will say, and they will make one ark, and they will give it in the gate of the house of Jehovah without.
{24:9} And they will give a voice in Judah and in Jerusalem, to bring in to Jehovah the loan of Moses the servant of God, upon Israel in the desert.
{24:10} And the chiefs and all the people will rejoice, and they will bring in and cast into the ark, even to finishing.
{24:11} And it will be in the time of bringing in the ark to the charge of the king by the hand of the Levites, and in their seeing that there was much silver, and the king's scribe came, and the head priest's overseer, and they will empty the ark and lift it up, and turn it back to its place. Thus they did to day by day, and they will gather silver for multitude.
{24:12} And the king and Jehoiada will give for doing the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and hewers and artificers will be hired to renew the house of Jehovah, and also for those working iron and brass to strengthen the house of Jehovah.
{24:13} And they doing the work will work, and healing will go up to the work by their hand, and they will cause the house of God to stand upon its measure, and they will make it firm.
{24:14} And in their finishing they brought before the king and Jehoiada the rest of the silver, and they will make vessels for the house of Jehovah, vessels to serve and to bring up, and dishes, and vessels of gold and silver. And they will be bringing up burnt-offerings in the house of Jehovah always all the days of Jehoiada.
{24:15} And Jehoiada will be old and full of days, and he will die the son of a hundred and thirty years in his death.
{24:16} And they will bury him in the city of David with the kings, for he did good in Israel, and with God and his house.
{24:17} And after the death of Jehoiada came the chiefs of Judah, and they will Worship to the king. Then the king heard to them.
{24:18} And they will forsake the house of Jehovah the God of their fathers, and they will serve the statues and the images: and wrath will be upon Judah and Jerusalem in this their trespass.
{24:19} And he will send prophets among them to turn them back to Jehovah; and they will testify against them: and they gave not ear.
{24:20} And the spirit of God clothed Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest, and he will stand from above to the people, and say to them, Thus said God, Wherefore are ye passing by the commands of Jehovah, and ye shall not prosper? for ye forsook Jehovah, and he will forsake you.
{24:21} And they will conspire against him, and stone him with stone by the commands of the king in the enclosure of the house of Jehovah.
{24:22} And Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father did with him, and he will kill his son. And in his death he said, Jehovah will see and seek out.
{24:23} And it will be at the circuit of the year, the power of Aram came up against him: and they will come to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroy all the chiefs of the people from the people, and all their spoil they sent to the king of Darmesek.
{24:24} For with a smallness of men came the army of Aram, and Jehovah gave into their hand an army to a great multitude, for they forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers. And they did judgment with Joash.
{24:25} And in their going away from him (for they forsook him in many diseases) his servants conspired against him for the bloods of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and they will kill him upon his bed, and he will die: and they will bury him in the city of David, and they buried him not in the graves of the kings.
{24:26} And these they conspiring against him: Zabad son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabitess.
{24:27} And his sons and the multitude of the lifting up upon him, and the founding of the house of God, behold them written upon the commentary of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son will reign in his stead.
{25:1} The son of twenty and five years reigned Amaziah, and twenty and nine years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Jehoaddan from Jerusalem.
{25:2} And he will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah, only not with a whole heart.
{25:3} And it will be when the kingdom was strengthened over him, and he will slay his servants striking the king his father.
{25:4} And their sons he slew not, for as written in the law in the book of Moses where Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the sons, and the sons shall not die for the fathers, for each shall die in his sin.
{25:5} And Amaziah will gather Judah together, and set them up for the house of the fathers for chiefs of thousands, and for chiefs of hundreds, to all Judah and Benjamin: and he will review them from the son of twenty years and above, and he will find them three hundred thousand chosen going forth to war, holding spear and shield.
{25:6} And he will hire from Israel a hundred thousand strong of power, with a hundred talents of silver.
{25:7} And a man of God came to him, saying, O king, the army of Israel shall not go with thee; for Jehovah is not with Israel all the sons of Ephraim.
{25:8} For if thou goest, to be strong for war: God will cause thee to falter before the enemy, for there is power with God to help and to cause to falter.
{25:9} And Amaziah will say to the man of God, And what to do for the hundred talents of silver which I gave to the troop of Israel? And the man of God will say, There is to Jehovah to give to thee much above this.
{25:10} And Amaziah will separate them for the troop which came to him from Ephraim to go to their place: and their anger will kindle greatly against Judah, and they will turn back to their place in the heat of anger.
{25:11} And Amaziah strengthened himself, and he will lead out his people, and go to the valley of salt, and he will strike the sons of Seir, ten thousand.
{25:12} And ten thousand living the sons of Judah carried away captive, and they will bring them to the head of the rock, and they will cast them down from the head of the rock, and they were rent asunder all of them.
{25:13} And the sons of the troop which Amaziah turned back from going with him to war, and they will invade upon the cities of Judah from Shomeron and even to the house of the hollow, and he will strike of them three thousand, and they will plunder much plunder.
{25:14} And it will be after Amaziah came from the smiting of the Edomites, and he will bring the gods of the sons of Seir, and he will set them up to him for gods, and worship before them, and burn incense to them.
{25:15} And the anger of Jehovah will kindle against Amaziah, and he will send to him a prophet, and he will say to him, Wherefore soughtest thou the gods of the people who delivered not their people from thy hand?
{25:16} And it will be in his speaking to him, and he will say to him, Did they give thee for counselor to the king? Desist; for thyself, wherefore shall they strike thee? And the prophet will desist, and say, I knew that God counseled to destroy thee, for thou didst this, and thou heardest not to my counsel.
{25:17} And Amaziah king of Judah will take counsel, and will send to Joash son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, we will see faces.
{25:18} And Joash king of Israel will send to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thorn-bush which was in Lebanon sent to the cedar which was in Lebanon, saying, Thou shalt give thy daughter to my son for wife: and a beast of the field that was in Lebanon will pass by and tread down the thorn-bush.
{25:19} Thou saidst, Behold, thou didst strike Edom; and thy heart lifted thee up to boast: now dwell in thy house; wherefore wilt thou be stirred up in evil, and thou fallest, and Judah with thee?
{25:20} And Amaziah heard not; for it was from God, so that he will give them into the hand, for they sought the gods of Edom.
{25:21} And Joash king of Israel will go up; and they will see faces, he and Amaziah king of Judah, in the house of the sun which was to Judah.
{25:22} And Judah will be smitten before Israel, and they will flee a man to his tent.
{25:23} And Joash king of Israel seized Amaziah king of Judah, son of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, in the house of the sun; and he will bring him to Jerusalem, and he will break in upon the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim, even to the gate of turning, four hundred cubits.
{25:24} And all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels being found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the king's house, and the sons of suretyship, and he will turn back to Shomeron.
{25:25} And Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah will live after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, fifteen years.
{25:26} And the rest of the words of Amaziah, the first and the last, behold, are they not written upon the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
{25:27} And from the time that Amaziah turned away from Jehovah and they will conspire against him a conspiracy in Jerusalem; and he will flee to Lachish: and they will send after him to Lachish, and they will kill him there.
{25:28} And they will lift him up upon horses, and bury him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
{26:1} And all the people will take Uzziah, and he the son of sixteen years, and they will make him king instead of his father Amaziah.
{26:2} He built Eloth and turned it back to Judah; afterwards the king lay down with his fathers.
{26:3} The son of sixteen years was Uzziah in his reigning, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Jecoliah from Jerusalem.
{26:4} And he will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah according to all which Amaziah his father did.
{26:5} And he will be for seeking God in the days of Zechariah understanding in the visions of God: and in the days of his seeking Jehovah, God prospered him.
{26:6} And he will go forth and war against the rovers, and he will break in the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he will build cities in Ashdod, and among the rovers.
{26:7} And God will help him against the rovers, and against the Arabians inhabiting Gur-Baal, and the Mehunims.
{26:8} And the Ammonites will give a gift to Uzziah: and his name will go even to the entrance of Egypt: for he was strengthened even to above.
{26:9} And Uzziah will build towers in Jerusalem at the gate of the corner, and at the gate of the valley, and at the angle, and he will strengthen them.
{26:10} And he will build towers in the desert, and hew out many wells: for there were many cattle to him; and in the low country and in the plain; and husbandmen and vine-dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he was loving the earth.
{26:11} And there will be to Uzziah an army making war, going forth to war to a troop in the number of their reviewing by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the leader, upon the hand of Hananiah from the kings chiefs.
{26:12} All the number of the heads of the fathers to the strong ones of power, two thousand and six hundred.
{26:13} And upon their hand the power of an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, making war with the strength of power to help to the king against the enemy.
{26:14} And Uzziah will prepare for them for all the army shields and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and for stones of slings.
{26:15} And he will make in Jerusalem engines, devised of him devising, to be upon the towers and upon the corners to cast with arrows and with great stones. And his name went forth even to afar off; for he was made wonderful to help even till he was strong.
{26:16} And in his being strong his heart was lifted up even to destruction: for he will transgress against Jehovah his God, and come in to the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
{26:17} And Azariah the priest will go in after him, and with him eighty priests to Jehovah, sons of strength.
{26:18} And they will stand against Uzziah the king, and say to him, Not to thee, Uzziah, to burn incense to Jehovah, but to the priests, the sons of Aaron, being consecrated to burn incense: go forth from the holy place, for thou didst trespass; and not to thee for honor from Jehovah God.
{26:19} And Uzziah will he angry, and in his hand a censer to burn incense: and in his being angry with the priests, the leprosy rose in his forehead before the priests in the house of Jehovah, from above to the altar of incense.
{26:20} And Azariah the head priest will turn to him, and all the priests, and behold, he was smitten in his forehead, and they will drive him out from thence; and he also hastened to go forth, for Jehovah struck him.
{26:21} And Uzziah the king will be smitten even to the day of his death; and he dwelt in a house of infirmity, leprous; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah: and Jotham his son over the king's house, judging the people of the land.
{26:22} And the rest of the words of Uzziah, the first and the last, wrote Isaiah son of Amos the prophet.
{26:23} And Uzziah will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him with his fathers in the field of the burial which was to the kings; for they said, He is leprous: and Jotham his son will reign in his stead.
{27:1} The son of twenty and five years was Jotham in his reigning, and sixteen years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Jerushah, daughter of Zadok.
{27:2} And he will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all which Uzziah his father did: only he came not into the temple of Jehovah. And the people yet being corrupted.
{27:3} He built the gate of the house of Jehovah the highest, and upon the wall of Ophel he built for multitude.
{27:4} And he built cities in the mountain of Judah, and in the thickets he built fortresses and towers.
{27:5} And he waged war with the king of the sons of Ammon, and he will be strong against them. And the sons of Ammon will give to him in that year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cors of wheat, and barley ten thousand. This the sons of Ammon turned back to him, in the second year, and the third.
{27:6} And Jotham will be strengthened, for he prepared his ways before Jehovah his God.
{27:7} And the rest of the words of Jotham, and all his works and his ways, behold them written upon the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
{27:8} The son of twenty and five years was he in his reigning, and sixteen years reigned he in Jerusalem.
{27:9} And Jotham will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son will reign in his stead.
{28:1} The son of twenty years was Ahaz in his reigning, and sixteen years reigned he in Jerusalem: and he did not the straight in the eyes of Jehovah according to David his father.
{28:2} And he will go in the ways of the kings of Israel, and also molten images made he to the Baals.
{28:3} And he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and he will burn his sons in fire according to the abomination of the nations which Jehovah dispossessed from before the sons of Israel.
{28:4} And he will sacrifice and burn incense in the heights, and upon the hills, and under every green tree.
{28:5} And Jehovah his God will give him into the hand of the king of Aram; and they will strike upon him, and they will make captives from them a great captivity, and bring to Darmesek. And also he was given into the hand of the king of Israel, and he will strike upon him a great blow.
{28:6} And Pekah son of Remaliah will kill in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, the whole sons of strength; in their forsaking Jehovah the God of their fathers.
{28:7} And Zichri a strong one of Ephraim will kill Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam leader of the house, of Elkanah, second to the king.
{28:8} And the sons of Israel will make captive from their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons and daughters, and also much spoil they plundered from them, and they will bring the spoil to Shomeron.
{28:9} And a prophet to Jehovah was there, Oded his name: and he will go forth before the army coming to Shomeron, and say to them, Behold, in the anger of Jehovah the God of your fathers upon Judah he gave them into your hand, and ye will slay among them in wrath reaching even to the heavens.
{28:10} And now ye are saying to subdue the sons of Judah and Jerusalem for servants and for maids to you: are not only with you trespasses with you against Jehovah your God?
{28:11} And now hear me and turn back the captivity that ye took captive from your brethren: for the burning of the anger of Jehovah is upon you.
{28:12} And there will arise up men from the heads of the sons of Ephraim, Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai, against those coming from the war,
{28:13} And they will say to them, Ye shall not bring the captivity here; because for trespass Jehovah is against us, ye saying to add to our sins and to our trespass: for great the trespass to us, and the burning of anger against Israel.
{28:14} And the armed will leave the captivity and the plunder before the chiefs and all the convocation.
{28:15} And men who were distinguished by names will rise up and will lay hold upon the captivity, and all their naked they clothed from the spoil, and they will clothe them, and shoe them, and feed them, and give them to drink, and anoint them, and conduct them upon asses for all being weak, and bring them to Jericho the city of palm trees, near their brethren: and they will turn back to Shomeron.
{28:16} In that time king Ahaz sent for the kings of Assur for help to him.
{28:17} And yet the Edomites came and they will strike in Judah, and take captive a captivity.
{28:18} And the rovers invaded upon the cities of the low country, and the south to Judah, and they will take the house of the sun, and the oak, and the walls, and the branches and her daughters, and the portion assigned and her daughters, and Gimzo and her daughters: and they will dwell there.
{28:19} For Jehovah humbled Judah on account of Ahaz king of Israel: for he was unbridled upon Judah, and transgressing, he transgressed against Jehovah.
{28:20} And Tilgath-Pileser king of Assur, will come to him and he will press upon him, and he strengthened him not.
{28:21} For Ahaz divided out the house of Jehovah, and the king's house, and the chiefs, and he will give to the king of Assur: and not for help to him.
{28:22} And in the time of straits to him and he will add to transgress against Jehovah: this the king Ahaz.
{28:23} And he will sacrifice to the gods of Darmesek smiting upon him: and he will say, Because the gods of the kings of Aram they help them, to them will I sacrifice, and they will help me. And they were to him for stumbling, and to all Israel.
{28:24} And Ahaz will gather together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah, and he will make to him altars in every corner in Jerusalem.
{28:25} And in every city and city to Judah he made heights to burn incense to other gods, and he will irritate Jehovah the God of his fathers.
{28:26} And the rest of his words and all his ways, the first and the last, behold them written upon the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
{28:27} And Ahaz will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in the city in Jerusalem: but they brought him not to the graves of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son will reign in his stead.
{29:1} And Hezekiah reigned the son of twenty and five years, and twenty and nine years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Abiah, daughter of Zechariah.
{29:2} And he will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah according to all which David his father did.
{29:3} He, in the first year to his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and he will strengthen them.
{29:4} And he will bring in the priests and the Levites, and he will gather them together to the street of the sunrising,
{29:5} And he will say to them, Hear me, ye Levites: now consecrate yourselves and consecrate the house of Jehovah the God of your fathers, and bring forth the uncleanness from the holy place.
{29:6} For our fathers trespassed and did evil in the eyes of Jehovah our God, and they will forsake and turn away their faces from the dwelling of Jehovah, and they will give the neck.
{29:7} Also they shut up the doors of the porch, and they will put out the lights, and they burnt not incense, and they brought not up the burnt-offering in the holy place to the God of Israel.
{29:8} And the wrath of Jehovah will be upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he will give them to disquiet, to astonishment, and to hissing, according to what ye see with your eyes.
{29:9} And behold, our fathers fell by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives in captivity for this.
{29:10} Now with my heart to cut out a covenant to Jehovah the God of Israel, and he will turn back from us the burning of his anger.
{29:11} My sons, now ye shall not go astray: for in you Jehovah chose to stand before him, to serve him, to be serving to him, and burning incense.
{29:12} And the Levites will rise up, Mahath son of Amasai, and Joel son of Azariah, from the sons of the Kohathites: and from the sons of the Merarites: Kish, son of Abdi, and Azariah, son of Jehalelel: and from the Gershonites: Joah, son of Zimmah, and Eden, son of Joah:
{29:13} And from the sons of Elizaphan: Shimri and Jeiel: and from the sons of Asaph: Zechariah and Mattaniah:
{29:14} And from the sons of Heman: Jehiel and Shimei: and from the sons of Jeduthun: Shemaiah and Uzziel.
{29:15} And they will gather their brethren, and they will consecrate themselves, and they will come according to the command of the king in the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.
{29:16} And the priests will come to within the house of Jehovah to cleanse, and they will bring forth all the uncleanness which they found in the temple of Jehovah to the enclosure of the house of Jehovah. And the Levites will take to bring forth to the torrent Kidron without.
{29:17} And they will begin in one to the first month to consecrate, and in the eighth day to the month they came to the porch of Jehovah: and they will consecrate the house of Jehovah for eight days; and in the sixteenth day to the first month they finished.
{29:18} And they will come within to Hezekiah the king, and say, We cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and the table of the arrangement and all its vessels.
{29:19} And all the vessels which king Ahaz cast away in his kingdom, in his transgression, we prepared and consecrated, and behold them before the altar of Jehovah.
{29:20} And Hezekiah the king will rise early and gather the chiefs of the city, and he will go up to the house of Jehovah.
{29:21} And they will bring seven bullocks and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats of the goats for sin, for the kingdom, and for the holy place, and for Judah. And he will say to the sons of Aaron the priests to bring up upon the altar of Jehovah.
{29:22} And they will slaughter the oxen, and the priests will take the blood and sprinkle the altar: and they will slaughter the rams, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar: and they will slaughter the lambs and sprinkle the blood upon the altar.
{29:23} And they will bring near the he goats of the sin before the king and the convocation; and they will lay their hands upon them.
{29:24} And the priest will slaughter them, and expiate the altar with their blood, to expiate for all Israel: for to all Israel the king said to bring up the sin.
{29:25} And he will set up the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with lyres and with harps by the command of David, and Gad, the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for by the hand of Jehovah the command by the hand of his prophets.
{29:26} And the Levites will stand with all the instruments of David, and the priests with trumpets.
{29:27} And Hezekiah will say to bring up the burnt-offering to the altar. And in the time of beginning to bring up, the song of Jehovah began, and the trumpets, and upon the hands of the instruments of David king of Israel.
{29:28} And all the convocation worshiping, and the song singing, and the trumpets trumpeting: the whole even to finishing the burnt-offering.
{29:29} And as they finished to bring up, the king and all being found with him, bowed and worshiped.
{29:30} And Hezekiah the king, and the chiefs, will say, to the Levites to praise to Jehovah in the words of David, and Asaph the seer. And they will praise even to gladness, and they will bow down and worship.
{29:31} And Hezekiah will answer and say, Now ye filled your hand to Jehovah, draw near and bring sacrifices and praises to the house of Jehovah. And the convocation will bring sacrifices and praises; and all of a willing heart, burnt-offerings.
{29:32} And the number of the burnt-offerings which the convocation brought, will be seventy oxen, a hundred rams, two hundred lambs: all these for a bunt-offering to Jehovah.
{29:33} And the consecrated things, six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
{29:34} Only the priests were for fewness and they could not slaughter all the burnt-offerings: and their brethren the Levites will strengthen them till the finishing of the work, and till the priests shall consecrate themselves: for the Levites being upright of heart to consecrate themselves more than the priests.
{29:35} And also the burnt-offering for multitude, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the libations for the burnt-offering. And the service of the house of Jehovah will be prepared.
{29:36} And Hezekiah will rejoice, and all the people, for God prepared for the people: for the word was in suddenness.
{30:1} And Hezekiah will send to all Israel and Judah, and also he wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh to come to the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, to do the passover to Jehovah the God of Israel.
{30:2} And the king will take counsel, and his chiefs, and all the convocation in Jerusalem, to do the passover in the second month.
{30:3} For they could not do it at that time for the priests consecrated not themselves sufficiently, and the people were not gathered to Jerusalem.
{30:4} And the word will be straight in the eyes of the king, and in the eyes of all the convocation.
{30:5} And they will set up a word to cause a voice to pass in all Israel, from the well of the oath, and even to judgment, to come to do the passover to Jehovah God of Israel in Jerusalem: for they did not for much time as written.
{30:6} And the runners will go with the letters from the hand of the king and his chiefs in all Israel and Judah, and according to the command of the king, saying, Ye sons of Israel, turn back to Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaak and Israel, and he will turn back to the escaping being left to you from the hand of the king of Assur.
{30:7} And ye shall not be as your fathers and as your brethren who trespassed against Jehovah the God of their fathers, and he will give them to desolation according to what ye see.
{30:8} Now ye shall not harden your neck as your fathers; ye shall give the hand to Jehovah, and come ye into his holy place which he consecrated forever: and serve ye Jehovah your God, and he will turn back from you the burning of his anger.
{30:9} For in your turning back to Jehovah, your brethren and your sons are for compassions before them making them captive, to turn back to this land: for Jehovah your God being merciful and compassionate, and he will not turn away his face from you if ye shall turn back to him.
{30:10} And the runners will be passing from city to city in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and even to Zebulon: and laughing upon them, and deriding over them.
{30:11} But men from Asher and Manasseh, and from Zebulon, were humbled, and they will come to Jerusalem.
{30:12} Also in Judah was the hand of God to give to them one heart to do the commands of the king and the chiefs by the word of Jehovah.
{30:13} And there will gather together many people at Jerusalem to do the festival of the unleavened in the second month, a convocation for exceeding greatness.
{30:14} And they will rise and take away the altars which were in Jerusalem, and the censers they removed, and they will cast to the torrent Kidron.
{30:15} They will slaughter the passover in the fourteenth to the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and they will consecrate themselves and bring burnt-offerings to the house of Jehovah.
{30:16} And they will stand upon their standing according to their judgment, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkling the bloods from the hand of the Levites.
{30:17} For many in the convocation which consecrated not themselves: and the Levites for slaughtering the passover to all not being cleansed to consecrate to Jehovah.
{30:18} For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulon, were not cleansed, for they ate the Passover not as written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, Jehovah the good will expiate in behalf.
{30:19} Of every one preparing his heart to seek God, Jehovah the God of his fathers, and not according to the purification of the holy place.
{30:20} And Jehovah will hear to Hezekiah and he will heal the people.
{30:21} And the sons of Israel, those found in Jerusalem, will do the festival of the unleavened seven days, in great gladness: and the priests and the Levites praising to Jehovah day by day with instruments of strength to Jehovah.
{30:22} And Hezekiah will speak to the heart of all the Levites considering the good knowledge to Jehovah: and they will eat at the appointment seven days, sacrificing sacrifices of peace, and confessing to Jehovah the God of their fathers.
{30:23} And all the convocation will take counsel to do other seven days: and they will do seven days with gladness.
{30:24} For Hezekiah king of Judah lifted up to the convocation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the chiefs lifted up to the convocation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and the priests will consecrate themselves to a multitude.
{30:25} And all the convocation of Judah will rejoice, and the priests and the Levites, and all the convocation coming from Israel, and the strangers coming from the land of Israel, and those dwelling in Judah.
{30:26} And there will be great gladness in Jerusalem: for from the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there was not as this in Jerusalem.
{30:27} And the priests the Levites will rise up and bless the people: and he will hear to their voice, and their prayer will come to the dwelling of his holy place to the heavens.
{31:1} And as all this was finished, all Israel being found will go forth to the cities of Judah, and they will break the images and cut off the statues and tear down the heights, and the altars of all Judah and Benjamin, and in Ephraim and Manasseh even to finishing. And all the sons of Israel will turn back each to his possession to their cities.
{31:2} And Hezekiah will set up the divisions of the priests and the Levites for their divisions each according to the mouth of his service to the priests and to the Levites for the burnt-offering and for the peace, to serve and to confess and to praise, in the gates of the camp of Jehovah.
{31:3} And the portion of the king from his possessions for the burnt-offerings, for the burnt-offerings of the morning and the evening, and the burnt-offerings for the Sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the appointments according as written in the law of Jehovah.
{31:4} And he will say to the people, to those inhabiting Jerusalem, to give the portion of the priests and the Levites so that they shall be strengthened in the law of Jehovah.
{31:5} And when the word broke forth, the sons of Israel increased the first-fruits of the grain, the new wine and the new oil, and honey, and all the produce of the field; and the tenth of all they brought in for abundance.
{31:6} And the sons of Israel and Judah dwelling in the cities of Judah, also they brought in the tenth of oxen and sheep, and the tenth of the holies being consecrated to Jehovah their God, and they will give heaps, heaps.
{31:7} In the third month the heaps began to be founded, and in the seventh month they were finished.
{31:8} And Hezekiah and the chiefs will come and see the heaps, and they will praise Jehovah and his people of Israel.
{31:9} And Hezekiah will seek to the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
{31:10} And Azariah the head priest for the house of Zadok will say to him and he will say, From the beginning to bring the oblations into the house of Jehovah, eating and being filled, and leaving even to abundance: for Jehovah blessed his people; and that being left this multitude.
{31:11} And Hezekiah will say to prepare cells in the house of Jehovah; and they will prepare,
{31:12} And they will bring in the oblations and the tenth, and the holies, with faithfulness: and over them the leader Cononiah the Levite, and Shimei his brother, the second.
{31:13} And Jehiel and Azaziah and Nahath and Asahel and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, reviewing from the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah leader of the house of God.
{31:14} And Kore, son of Imnah the Levite, the gate-keeper to the sunrising over the voluntaries of God, to give the oblations of Jehovah, and the holies of holies.
{31:15} And upon his hand Eden and Miniamin, and Joshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, with faithfulness,-to give to their brethren by divisions according to the great, according to the small:
{31:16} Besides their enrolling to males from the son of three years and above, to all coming to the house of Jehovah, for the word of a day in its day for their service in their watches according to their divisions.
{31:17} And the enrolling of the priests for the house of their fathers, and the Levites from the son of twenty years and above, in their watches, by their divisions:
{31:18} And to the enrolling upon all their little ones, their wives and their sons, and their daughters, for all the convocation: for in their faithfulness they will consecrate themselves holy:
{31:19} And to the sons of Aaron the priests in the fields of the area of their cities, in every city and city, the men who were distinguished by names to give gifts to every male among the priests, and to all the enrolling among the Levites.
{31:20} And according to this Hezekiah will do in all Judah, and he will do the good and the straight and the truth before Jehovah his God.
{31:21} And in all the work which he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law and in the command to seek to his God, with all his heart he did, and prospered.
{32:1} After these words and the truth, came Senherib king of Assur, and he will come into Judah, and will encamp against the fortified cities, and say to divide them for himself.
{32:2} And Hezekiah will see that Senherib came, and his face for war against Jerusalem.
{32:3} And he will take counsel with his chiefs and his strong ones to stop the waters of the fountains which were without to the city: and they will help him.
{32:4} And much people will be gathered together, and they will stop all the fountains, and the torrent gushing through the midst of the land, saving, Wherefore shall the kings of Assur come and find many waters?
{32:5} And he will strengthen himself and build all the wall broken down, and he will go up upon the towers, and to without another wall, and he will strengthen the filling up of the city of David, and he will make darts for abundance, and shields.
{32:6} And he will give chiefs of the war over the people, and he will gather them together to him to the street of the gate of the city, and he will speak to their heart, saying,
{32:7} Be strong and be firm ye shall not fear and ye shall not be terrified-from the face of the king of Assur, and from before all the multitude which are with him: for with us much more than with him.
{32:8} With him an arm of flesh; and with us Jehovah our God to help, and to war our wars. And the people will lean upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
{32:9} After this Senherib king of Assur sent his servants to Jerusalem (and he at Lachish, and all his dominion with him) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and against all Judah which were in Jerusalem, saying,
{32:10} Thus said Senherib king of Assur, Upon what are ye trusting, and dwelling in the fortress in Jerusalem?
{32:11} Is not Hezekiah stimulating you to give yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assur?
{32:12} Did not this Hezekiah remove his heights, and his altars? and he will say to Judah and to Jerusalem, saying, Before one altar shall ye worship and upon it shall ye burn incense?
{32:13} Will ye not know what I did, I and my fathers, to all the peoples of the lands? Being able, were the gods of the nations of the lands able to deliver their land from my hand?
{32:14} Who from all the gods of these nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, which were able to deliver his people from my hand, that your God shall be able to deliver you from my hand?
{32:15} And now Hezekiah shall not deceive you, and he shall not stimulate you according to this, and ye shall not believe upon him: for not any God of any nation and kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my father: much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand.
{32:16} And yet spake his servants against Jehovah God, and against Hezekiah his servant.
{32:17} And he wrote letters to reproach to Jehovah God of Israel, and to say against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands who delivered not their people from my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people from my hand.
{32:18} And they will call with a great voice in Judaic to the people of Jerusalem which were upon the wall, to cause them to fear and to terrify them, so that they shall take the city.
{32:19} And they will speak against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the peoples of the land, the work of the hand of man.
{32:20} And Hezekiah the king will pray, and Isaiah the prophet, son of Amos, for this, and they will cry to the heavens.
{32:21} And Jehovah will send a messenger, and he will cut off every strong one of power, and leader and chief in the camp of the king of Assur. And he will turn back with shame of face to his land. And he will come into the house of his God, and they coming forth from his bowels caused him to fall there by the sword.
{32:22} And Jehovah will save Hezekiah, and those inhabiting Jerusalem, from the hand of Senherib king of Assur, and from the hand of all, and protect them from round about.
{32:23} And many bringing a gift to Jehovah to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah: and he will be lifted up to the eyes of all the nations from after this.
{32:24} In those days Hezekiah was sick even to death, and he will pray to Jehovah: and he will say to him, and be gave to him a sign.
{32:25} And not according to the doing to him did Hezekiah turn back, for his heart was lifted up: and there will be wrath upon him, and upon Judah and upon Jerusalem.
{32:26} And Hezekiah will humble himself for the lifting up of his heart, he and those inhabiting Jerusalem, and the wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
{32:27} And there will be to Hezekiah riches and honor exceedingly much: and he made to him treasuries for silver and for gold, and for precious stone, and for spices and for shields, and for all vessels of desire:
{32:28} And stores for produce of grain and new wine, and new oil, and stalls for all cattle, and cattle and flocks for the stalls.
{32:29} And he made cities to him and possession of flocks and oxen for abundance: for God gave to him exceeding much substance.
{32:30} And this Hezekiah stopped the going forth of the waters of Gihon the highest, and he will make them straight down from the west to the city of David. And Hezekiah will prosper in all his work.
{32:31} Thus in the chiefs of Babel interceding, sending to him to seek out the sign which was in the land, God left him, to try him, to know all in his heart.
{32:32} And the rest of the words of Hezekiah and his mercies, behold them written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, son of Amos, upon the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
{32:33} And Hezekiah will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in the ascent of the graves of the sons of David: and all Judah and those inhabiting Jerusalem did honor to him in his death: and Manasseh his son will reign in his stead.
{33:1} The son of twelve years was Manasseh in his reigning, and fifty and five years he reigned in Jerusalem.
{33:2} And he will do the evil in the eyes of Jehovah, as the abominations of the nations which Jehovah dispossessed from before the sons of Israel.
{33:3} And he will turn back and build the heights which Hezekiah his father pulled down; and he will raise up altars for the Baals, and he will make statues, and worship to all the army of the heavens, and he will serve them.
{33:4} And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, which Jehovah said, In Jerusalem shall be my name forever.
{33:5} And he will build altars to all the army of the heavens in the two enclosures of the house of Jehovah.
{33:6} And he caused his sons to pass through in fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: and he practiced magic and used divination, and offered prayers, and made sorcerers and wizards: he multiplied to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah to irritate him.
{33:7} And he will set up a carved image, the likeness which he made in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house and in Jerusalem which I chose from all the tribes of Israel, I will set my name forever.
{33:8} And I will not add to remove the foot of Israel from the land which I set to your fathers; only if they will watch to do all I commanded them, for all the law and the precepts and the judgments by the hand of Moses.
{33:9} And Manasseh will cause Judah and those inhabiting Jerusalem to wander, to do evil more than the nations which Jehovah destroyed from before the sons of Israel.
{33:10} And Jehovah will speak to Manasseh, and to his people, and they attended not.
{33:11} And Jehovah will bring upon them the chiefs of the army which were to the king of Assur, and they will take Manasseh with hooks, and they will bind him with fetters and cause him to go to Babel.
{33:12} And when straits were to him he besought the face of Jehovah his God, and he will humble himself greatly from before the God of his fathers.
{33:13} And he will pray to him, and he will be entreated for him, and he will hear his supplication, and he will turn him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom. And Manasseh knew that Jehovah he is God.
{33:14} And after this he built a wall outside to the city of David from the west to Gihon, in the valley to the entering into the gate of fishes, and it turned round about to the hill, and he will lift it up greatly, and he will set chiefs of the army in all the fortified cities in Judah.
{33:15} And he will remove the strange gods and the likeness from the house of Jehovah, and all the altars which he built in the mountain of the house of Jehovah, and in Jerusalem, and he will cast without to the city.
{33:16} And he will build the altar of Jehovah, and he will sacrifice upon it sacrifices of peace and praise, and he will say to Judah serve Jehovah the God of Israel.
{33:17} But the people yet are sacrificing in the height, only to Jehovah their God.
{33:18} And the rest of the words of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers speaking to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, behold them upon the words of the kings of Israel.
{33:19} And his prayer, and he was entreated for him and all his sin, and his transgression, and the places where he built in them heights, and he set up statues and carved images before his humbling: behold them written upon the words of the seers.
{33:20} And Manasseh will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in his house: and Amon his son will reign in his stead.
{33:21} The son of twenty and two years was Amon in his reigning, and two years he reigned in Jerusalem.
{33:22} And he will do the evil in the eyes of Jehovah as did Manasseh his father: and to all the carved images which Manasseh his father made, Amon sacrificed, and he will serve them.
{33:23} And he was not humbled from before Jehovah as Manasseh his father humbled himself; for this Amon multiplied trespass.
{33:24} And his servants will conspire against him, and they will kill him in his house.
{33:25} And the people of the land will strike all those conspiring against king Amon; and the people of the land will make Josiah his son king in his stead.
{34:1} The son of eight years was Josiah in his reigning, and thirty and one years he reigned in Jerusalem.
{34:2} And he did the straight in the eyes of Jehovah, and he went in the ways of David his father, and he turned not to the right and to the left.
{34:3} And in the eighth year to his reigning, and he yet a youth, he began to seek to the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem from the heights, and the statues, and the carved images, and the molten images.
{34:4} And they will pull down the altars of the Baals before him, and the images which were above from on high to them he cut down; and the statues and the carved images, and the molten images he break in pieces and beat small, and he will strew upon the face of the graves of those sacrificing to them.
{34:5} And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and he will cleanse Judah and Jerusalem.
{34:6} And in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim, and Simeon, and even to Naphtali he proved their houses round about.
{34:7} And he will pull down the altars and the statues, and the carved images he beat down to make fine, and he cut down all the images in all the land of Israel, and he will turn back to Jerusalem.
{34:8} And in the eighteenth year to his reigning, to cleanse the land and the house he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah chief of the city, and Joah son of Joahaz the rememberer to strengthen the house of Jehovah his God.
{34:9} And they will come to Hilkiah the great priest, and they will give the silver being brought to the house of God, which the Levites watching the threshold gathered from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin; and they will turn back to Jerusalem.
{34:10} And they will give to the hand of those appointed to do the work in the house of Jehovah, and they will give it to those doing the work, working in the house of Jehovah to repair and to strengthen the house.
{34:11} And they will give to the artificers and to the builders to buy stones and woods for junctions, and to frame the houses which the kings of Judah destroyed.
{34:12} And the men doing in the work in faithfulness: and over them being appointed Jahath and Obadiah the Levites from the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam from the sons of the Kohathites to superintend; and the Levites all understanding in instruments of song.
{34:13} And over those carrying, and superintending to all doing the work for service and service: and from the Levites, scribes and leaders and gate-keepers.
{34:14} And in their bringing forth the silver being brought to the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Jehovah by the band of Moses.
{34:15} And Hilkiah will answer and say to Shaphan the scribe, I found a book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah will give the book to Shaphan.
{34:16} And Shaphan will bring the book to the king, and he will yet turn back word to the king, saying, All which was given into the hand of thy servants, they do.
{34:17} And they will pour out the silver being found in the house of Jehovah, and they will give it to the hand of those reviewing, and to the hand of those doing the work.
{34:18} And Shaphan the scribe will announce to the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest gave a book to me. And Shaphan will read in it before the king.
{34:19} And it will be when the king heard the words of the law, and he will rend his garments.
{34:20} And the king will command Hilkiah, and Ahikam son of Shaphan, and Abdon son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah servant of the king saying,
{34:21} Go seek Jehovah for me, and for those being left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book which was found: for great the wrath of Jehovah which is poured out upon us, because our fathers watched not the word of Jehovah to do according to all written upon this book.
{34:22} And Hilkiah will go, and those of the king, to Huldah the prophetess, wife of Shallum son of Tikvath, son of Hasrah, watching the garments; (and she will dwell in Jerusalem in the second rank) and they will speak to her according to this.
{34:23} And she will say to them, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Say to the man who sent you to me,
{34:24} Thus said Jehovah, Behold me bringing evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants, all the curses written upon the book which they read before the king of Judah:
{34:25} Because that they forsook me, and they will burn incense to other gods, so that they irritated me with all the works of their hands; and my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched.
{34:26} And to the king of Judah sending you to seek in Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel the words which thou heardest;
{34:27} Because thy heart was tender, and thou wilt be humbled from before God in thy hearing his words against this place and against its inhabitants, and thou wilt be humbled before me, and thou wilt rend thy garments and weep before me; I also heard, says Jehovah.
{34:28} Behold me gathering thee to thy fathers, and thou wert gathered to thy graves in peace, and thine eyes shall not look upon all the evil which I bring upon this place and upon its inhabitants. And they will turn back word to the king.
{34:29} And the kind will send and gather together all the old men of Judah and Jerusalem.
{34:30} And the king will go up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests and the Levites, and all the people, from great and even to small: and he will read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant being found in the house of Jehovah.
{34:31} And the king will stand upon his standing, and he will cut out a covenant before Jehovah to go after Jehovah and to watch his commands and his testimonies, and his laws with all his heart and with all his soul, to do the words of the covenant being written upon this book.
{34:32} And he will cause to stand all being found in Jerusalem and Benjamin. And they inhabiting Jerusalem will do according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
{34:33} And Josiah will remove all the abominations out of all the lands which were to the sons of Israel, and he will cause to serve all being found in Israel, to serve Jehovah their God. All his days they departed not from after Jehovah the God of their fathers.
{35:1} And Josiah will do in Jerusalem the passover to Jehovah: and they will slaughter the passover in the fourteenth day to the first month.
{35:2} And he will cause the priests to stand upon their watches, and he will strengthen them to serve the house of Jehovah.
{35:3} And he will say to the Levites causing to all Israel to understand, being consecrated to Jehovah, Ye shall give the holy ark into the house which Solomon son of David, king of Israel built: not to you a lifting up upon the shoulder: now serve ye Jehovah your God and his people Israel.
{35:4} And prepare yourselves to the house of your fathers in your divisions, in the writing of David king of Israel, and in the writing of Solomon his son:
{35:5} And stand ye in the holy place for the divisions of the house of the fathers to your brethren the sons of the people, and the division of the father's house to the Levites.
{35:6} And slaughter ye the passover and consecrate yourselves, and prepare for your brethren to do according to the word of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.
{35:7} And Josiah will lift up to the sons of the people, sheep, lambs and sons of the goats, the whole for the paschal lambs for all being found to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand oxen: these from the king's substance.
{35:8} And his chiefs for willingness to the people, to the priests and to the Levites, lifted up: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, leaders of the house of God, gave to the priests for paschal lambs, two thousand and six hundred, and three hundred oxen.
{35:9} And Cononiah and Shemaiah, and Nathaniel his brethren, and Hashabiah, and Jeiel, and Jozabad, chiefs of the Levites, lifted up to the Levites for paschal lambs, five thousand, and five hundred oxen.
{35:10} And the service will be prepared, and the priests will stand upon their standing, and the Levites upon their divisions according to the command of the king.
{35:11} And they will slaughter the passover, and the priests will sprinkle from their hand, and the Levites flaying.
{35:12} And they will remove the burnt-offering to give them to the divisions for the house of the fathers to the sons of the people, to bring near to Jehovah according to the writing in the book of Moses. And thus to the oxen.
{35:13} And they will roast the passover in fire according to judgment: and the holy things they cooked in pots and in boilers, and in dishes, and they will cause to run to all the sons of the people.
{35:14} And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests: for the priests the sons of Aaron in bringing up the burnt-offering and the fat, even till night; and the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
{35:15} And those singing, sons of Asaph, upon their station according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the kings seer; and the porters at gate and gate; not for them to depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
{35:16} And all the service of Jehovah will be prepared in that day to do the passover, and bring up the burnt-offerings upon the altar of Jehovah, according to the command of the king Josiah.
{35:17} And the sons of Israel being found will do the passover in that time, and the festival of the unleavened seven days.
{35:18} And a passover as this was not done in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; and all the kings of Israel did not like the passover which Josiah did, and the priests and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel being found, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
{35:19} In the eighteenth year to the kingdom of Josiah was done this passover.
{35:20} After all this, when Josiah prepared the house, Necho king of Egypt came up to war against Carchemish upon Phrath: and Josiah will go forth to meet him.
{35:21} And he will send messengers to him, saying, What to me and to thee, thou king of Judah? Not against thee this day, but against the house of my war: and God said to hasten me: cease to thyself from God who is with me, and he will not destroy thee.
{35:22} And Josiah turned not his face from him, but to fight with him he disguised himself, and he heard not to the words of Necho from the mouth of God; and he will go forth to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
{35:23} And the archers will shoot at king Josiah; and the king will say to his servants, Cause me to pass away; for I was made sick greatly.
{35:24} And his servants will cause him to pass from the chariot, and they will cause him to ride in the second chariot which was to him; and they will cause him to go to Jerusalem, and he will die, and be buried in the graves of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourning for Josiah.
{35:25} And Jeremiah will lament for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women will speak concerning Josiah in their lamentations, even to this day, and they will give them for a law upon Israel: and behold them written upon the lamentations.
{35:26} And the rest of the words of Josiah and his mercies as written in the law of Jehovah,
{35:27} And his words, the first and the last, behold them written upon the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
{36:1} And the people of the land will take Jehoahaz son of Josiah, and make him king instead of his father in Jerusalem.
{36:2} The son of three and twenty years was Jehoahaz in his reigning, and three months reigned he in Jerusalem.
{36:3} And the king of Egypt will remove him in Jerusalem, and he will amerce the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
{36:4} And the king of Egypt will make Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and he will turn his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho will take Jehoahaz his brother and bring him to Egypt.
{36:5} The son of twenty and five years was Jehoiakim in his reigning, and eleven years reigned he in Jerusalem: and he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah his God.
{36:6} Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and he will bind him in fetters to cause him to go to Babel.
{36:7} And from the vessels of the house of God Nebuchadnezzar brought to Babel, and he will give them into his temple in Babel.
{36:8} And the rest of the words of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that being found upon him, behold them written upon the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son will reign in his stead.
{36:9} The son of eight years was Jehoiachin in his reigning, and three months and ten days reigned he in Jerusalem: and he will do the evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
{36:10} And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent and he will bring him to Babel, with the vessels of desire of the house of Jehovah, and he will make Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
{36:11} The son of twenty and one years was Zedekiah in his reigning, and eleven years reigned he in Jerusalem.
{36:12} And he will do the evil in the eyes of Jehovah his God; he was not humbled from before Jeremiah the prophet from the mouth of Jehovah.
{36:13} And also he rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar who caused him to swear by God: and he will harden his neck and strengthen his heart from turning back to Jehovah the God of Israel.
{36:14} Also all the chiefs of the priests and the people multiplied to Transgress transgression according to all the abominations of the nations; and they will defile the house of Jehovah which he consecrated in Jerusalem.
{36:15} And Jehovah the God of their fathers will send to them by the hand of his messengers, rising early and sending; for he compassionated upon his people, and upon his dwelling:
{36:16} For they will be mocking upon the messengers of God, and despising his words, and scoffing at his prophets, even to the bringing up the wrath of Jehovah against his people, even to no healing.
{36:17} And he will bring against them the king of the Chaldeans, and he will kill their chosen with the sword in the house of the holy place, and he pitied not over young man and virgin, old man and the gray-headed: he gave all into his hand.
{36:18} And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king and his chiefs, he brought the whole to Babel.
{36:19} And they will burn the house of God and break down the walls of Jerusalem, and burn all her palaces in fire, and all her precious vessels for destruction.
{36:20} And the remainder from the sword he will carry away captive to Babel; and they will be to him and to his sons for servants, even to the reigning of the kingdom of Persia:
{36:21} To fill up the word of Jehovah in the mouth of Jeremiah, till the land delighted in her Sabbaths: all the days she was laid waste she rested, to complete seventy years.
{36:22} And in the year one to Cyrus king of Persia, to complete the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, Jehovah roused up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he will cause a voice to pass in all his kingdom, and also in writing, saying,
{36:23} Thus said Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth gave Jehovah the God of the heavens to me; and he charged upon me to build to him a house in Jerusalem which is in Judah. Who among you from all his people? Jehovah his God be with him, and he shall go up.
