{1:1} Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
{1:2} We return thanks to God always for you all, making remembrance of you in our prayers continually;
{1:3} Remembering your work of faith, and fatigue of love, and patience of hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before God and our Father;
{1:4} Knowing, brethren beloved, of God your selection.
{1:5} For our good news was not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much complete certainty; as we know what we were among you for your sake.
{1:6} And ye were imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much pressure, with joy of the Holy Spirit:
{1:7} So that ye were types to all believing in Macedonia and Achaia.
{1:8} For from you sounded forth the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith towards God went out; so that we have no need to speak any thing.
{1:9} For they themselves proclaim of us what entrance we have to you, and how ye turned to God from images to serve the living and true God;
{1:10} And to wait for his Son from the heavens, whom be raised from the dead, Jesus, saving us from coming wrath.
{2:1} For ye yourselves know, brethren, our entrance to you, that it was not in vain:
{2:2} But also having suffered before, and having been injured, as ye know, among the Philippians, we acted freely in our God to speak to you the good news of God with much contest.
{2:3} For our entreaty nor from error, nor from uncleanness, nor in deceit:
{2:4} But as we have been tried by God to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, trying our hearts:
{2:5} For neither once in word were we flatterers, as ye know, neither in a pretext of covetousness; God the witness:
{2:6} Neither seeking glory of men, nor of you, nor of others, being able to be in weight, as the sent of Christ.
{2:7} But we were gentle in the midst of you, as a nurse should cherish her children:
{2:8} So longing for you, we are contented to impart to you, not only the good news of God, but also our own souls, because ye are dearly beloved to us.
{2:9} For ye remember, brethren, our fatigue and toil: for also working night and day, not to overload any of you, we proclaimed to you the good news of God.
{2:10} Ye witnesses, and God, how holily and justly and unblamably we were to you the believing:
{2:11} As ye know how each one of you, as a father his children, comforting and encouraging, and testifying,
{2:12} For you to walk worthy of God, calling you into his kingdom and glory.
{2:13} For this also we return thanks to God continually, that, having received the word of God from our report, ye received not the word of man, but as it is truly, the word of God, which is also energetic in you the believing.
{2:14} For ye, brethren, were imitators of the churches of God being in Judea in Christ Jesus: for ye also suffered the same things by your own race, as they also by the Jews:
{2:15} They also having slain the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and having driven you out; and not pleasing God, and opposite to all men;
{2:16} Hindering us from speaking to the nations that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: and the wrath of God has come before upon them even to the end.
{2:17} And we, brethren, having been separated from you for a due measure of time, in face, not in heart, we were the more excessively zealous to see your face with much eager desire.
{2:18} Wherefore we would have come to you, I Paul, truly also once and twice; and the adversary hindered us.
{2:19} For what our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? Are not also ye before our Lord Jesus Christ in his arrival?
{2:20} For ye are our glory and joy.
{3:1} Wherefore no more concealing, we were content to be left among the Athenians alone:
{3:2} And sent Timothy, our brother, and servant of God, and our coworker in the good news of Christ, in order to make you firm, and comfort you for your faith
{3:3} For none to be shaken in these pressures: for ye yourselves know that for this we are placed.
{3:4} For also, when we were with you, we told you before that we were about to be pressed; as also it was, and ye know.
{3:5} For this I also, no more concealing, sent to know your faith, lest some way he tempting have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.
{3:6} And now Timothy having come to us from you, and having announced to us the good news, your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, greatly desiring to see us, as we also you:
{3:7} For this, brethren, were we comforted in you in all our pressure, and necessity by your faith:
{3:8} For now we live, if ye stand in the Lord.
{3:9} For what thankfulness can we return to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for you before our God;
{3:10} Night and day praying exceedingly to see your face, and to adjust things wanting of your faith?
{3:11} And God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you:
{3:12} And the Lord increase you and make you to abound in love to one another, and to all, as also we to you:
{3:13} To make your hearts firm, complete in holiness before God, and our Father, in the arrival of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his holy ones.
{4:1} Therefore as to the rest, brethren we ask you, and beseech in the Lord Jesus, as ye received from us how ye must walk and please God, that ye may more abound.
{4:2} For ye know what orders we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
{4:3} For this is the will of God, your consecration, that ye should keep away from fornication:
{4:4} For each of you to know how to possess his vessel in consecration and honour;
{4:5} Not in the passion of eager desire, as also the nations not knowing God:
{4:6} Not to pass over and have the advantage over his brother in business: because the Lord just for all these, as we told you before and testified.
{4:7} But God has not called you to uncleanness, but in consecration.
{4:8} For surely therefore he despising, despises not man, but God, he also giving his holy Spirit for us.
{4:9} And for brotherly love ye have no need to write to you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
{4:10} For also ye do the same to all the brethren, them in the whole of Macedonia: and we beseech you, brethren, to more abound;
{4:11} And that ye be ambitions to remain quiet, and attend to your own things, and work with your own hands, as we enjoined you;
{4:12} That ye should walk becomingly to them without, and have need of nothing.
{4:13} And I wish you not to be ignorant, brethren, of them having been asleep, that ye should not grieve, as also the rest, they hating no hope.
{4:14} For if we believe that Jesus died and rose up, so also God by Jesus Christ will bring with him them having slept.
{4:15} For this we say to you in the word of the Lord, that we the living being left at the arrival of the Lord shall not get beforehand with them having slept.
{4:16} For the Lord himself in the word of command, in the voice of the archangel, shall descend from heaven: and the dead in Christ shall be raised first:
{4:17} Then we the living being left shall be snatched up together with them in the clouds, to the meeting of the Lord in the air: and so we shall always be with the Lord.
{4:18} Therefore comfort ye one another with these words.
{5:1} And of the times and seasons, brethren, ye have no need to write to you.
{5:2} For ye yourselves know accurately that the day of the Lord, as a thief in the night, so comes.
{5:3} For when they say, Peace and security; then sudden ruin is upon them, as anguish in her with child; and they may not escape.
{5:4} And ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day as a thief overtake you.
{5:5} Ye are all sons of light, and sons of day: we are not of night, nor of darkness.
{5:6} Therefore let us not sleep, as also the rest; but let us watch and be sober.
{5:7} For they sleeping sleep in the night; and they drunken are drunken in the night.
{5:8} And we, being of the day, let us be sober, putting on the coat of mail of faith and love; and a helmet, the hope of salvation.
{5:9} For God set us not for wrath, but for the acquisition of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
{5:10} He having died for us, that, whether we watch or sleep, we should live together with him.
{5:11} Wherefore comfort one another, and build up one another, as also ye do.
{5:12} And we ask you, brethren, to know those being fatigued among you, and set over you in the Lord, and reminding you;
{5:13} And to think them above ordinary in love for their work. Live in peace in yourselves.
{5:14} And we beseech you, brethren, remind the disorderly, encourage the timid, sustain the weak, and be slow to anger to all.
{5:15} See that any return not evil to any: but always pursue good to one another, and to all.
{5:16} Rejoice always.
{5:17} Pray continually.
{5:18} In every thing return thanks: for this the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.
{5:19} Quench not the Spirit.
{5:20} Set not prophecies at nought.
{5:21} Try all things; hold the good.
{5:22} Keep away from all appearance of evil.
{5:23} And the same God of peace consecrate you perfectly compete; and your whole spirit and soul and body be kept faultless to the arrival of our Lord Jesus Christ.
{5:24} Faithful he calling you, who also will do.
{5:25} Brethren, pray for us.
{5:26} Greet all the brethren in a holy kiss.
{5:27} I bind you by oath, for the epistle to be read to all the holy brethren.
{5:28} The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you. Amen.
