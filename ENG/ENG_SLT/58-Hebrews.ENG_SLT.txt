{1:1} God, formerly multifariously and abundantly having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,
{1:2} At these last days spake to us in the Son, whom he set heir of all things, by whom also he made the times;
{1:3} Who being the brightness of glory, and the figure of his foundation, and bearing all things by the word of his power, having made by himself the purification of our sins, he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty among the highest ones;
{1:4} Being so much better than the angels, inasmuch as he has inherited a more distinguished name than they.
{1:5} For to which of the angels once said he, Thou art my Son, I have this day begotten thee? And again, I will be to him for Father, and he shall be to me for Son?
{1:6} And when again he should bring in the firstborn to the habitable globe, he says, And let all the angels of God worship him.
{1:7} And truly to the angels of God he says, Who making his angels spirits, and his workmen flames of fire.
{1:8} And to the Son, Thy throne, O God, for the time of time: a rod of uprightness the rod of thy kingdom.
{1:9} Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity; for this God anointed thee, thy God, with the oil of lively joy above thy partakers.
{1:10} And, Thou, at the beginning, Lord, didst lay the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands:
{1:11} These shall be destroyed; but thou remainest; and they all as a garment shall grow old;
{1:12} And as a cloak shalt thou turn them round, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
{1:13} And to which of the angels has he once said, Sit on my right hand, till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?
{1:14} Are they not all spirits qualified for service, sent forth for service for them about to inherit salvation?
{2:1} For this ought we to hold above measure to the things heard, lest we slip away.
{2:2} For if the word spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and bad instruction received the just payment of reward;
{2:3} How shall we escape, having neglected such great salvation; which at the beginning taken to be spoken by the Lord, by them having heard was made firm to us;
{2:4} God confirming the testimony, together with signs and wonders, and various powers, and partitions of the Holy Spirit, according to his will.
{2:5} For not to the angels has he subjected the habitable globe about to be, of which we speak.
{2:6} And somewhere a certain one testified, saying, What is man, that thou rememberest him? or the son of man, that thou reviewest him?
{2:7} Thou didst render him some little while less than angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst place him over the work of thine hands:
{2:8} All things didst thou place under his feet. For in placing all things under him, thou didst leave nothing not subjected to him. And now we see not yet all things placed under him.
{2:9} But we see Jesus, made some little while less than angels by the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; so that by the grace of God he should taste of death for all.
{2:10} For it became him, for whom all things, and by whom all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the chief of their salvation by sufferings.
{2:11} For be consecrating and they being consecrated all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
{2:12} Saying, I will announce thy name to my brethren, in the midst of the church will I praise thee.
{2:13} And again, I will be confident in him. And again, Behold I and the young children which God gave me.
{2:14} Since therefore the young children participated in flesh and blood, he also likewise participated with them; that by death he might leave unemployed him having the strength of death, that is, the devil;
{2:15} And deliver them, as many as by fear of death were always to live bound by slavery.
{2:16} For certainly he lays not hold of angels; but of the seed of Abraham he lays hold.
{2:17} Wherefore in all things it was necessary to be made like to the brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful chief priest in things towards God, in order to propitiate for the sin of the people.
{2:18} For in that he himself has suffered, having been tempted, he is able to help the tempted.
{3:1} Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, observe the sent and Chief Priest of our assent, Christ Jesus;
{3:2} Faithful to him having made him, as also Moses in his whole house.
{3:3} For this was deemed worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he has greater honour of the house having built it.
{3:4} For every house is built by somebody; and he having built all things, God.
{3:5} And truly Moses faithful in his whole house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things to be spoken;
{3:6} And Christ as a son over his house: whose house are we, if we should hold freedom of speech and the boast of hope firm to the end.
{3:7} Wherefore (as the Holy Spirit says, If to day ye hear his voice,
{3:8} Harden not your hearts, as in the exasperation, in the day of trial in the desert:
{3:9} Where your fathers tried me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
{3:10} Wherefore I was offended with that generation and I said, They always wander in heart; and they knew not my ways.
{3:11} As I aware in my wrath, If they shall come into my rest.)
{3:12} See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in removing away from the living God.
{3:13} But beseech one another according to each day, as far as the day is called; lest any of you be hardened by deceit of sin.
{3:14} For we have been partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our foundation firm to the end;
{3:15} In that it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, ye should not harden your hearts, as in the exasperation.
{3:16} For some, having heard, did exasperate: but not all they having come out of Egypt by Moses.
{3:17} And with whom was he offended forty years? was it not with them having sinned, whose members fell in the desert?
{3:18} And to whom sware he that they could not come into his rest, if not to them having been disobedient?
{3:19} And we see they could not come in through unbelief.
{4:1} Let us therefore fear, lest a solemn promise being left to come into his rest, any of you should seem to have failed.
{4:2} For we also were announced of the good news, as well as they: but the word of the report profited them not, not being mixed with faith to them having heard.
{4:3} For we having believed come into the rest, as he said, As I sware in my wrath, if they shall come into my rest: although the works having been from the foundation of the world.
{4:4} For he said somewhere of the seventh thus, And God ceased in the seventh day from all his works.
{4:5} And in this again, If they shall enter into my rest.
{4:6} Since therefore it remains for some to come into it, and they before announced of the good news came not in through unbelief:
{4:7} Again he limits a certain day, saying in David, To day, after such time; as it is said, To day if ye would hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
{4:8} For if Jesus had caused them to rest, he would not have spoken of another day after these things.
{4:9} Therefore a celebration of a sabbath remains to the people of God.
{4:10} For he having come into his rest, he also has ceased from his works, as God from his own.
{4:11} Therefore we should be earnest to come into that rest, lest any should fall in the same pattern of unbelief.
{4:12} For the word of God living, and effective, and more piercing than any two-mouthed sword, and penetrating even to the division both of soul and spirit, both the joints and marrows, and a critic of the reflections and thoughts of the heart.
{4:13} And there is no creation invisible before him: and all things naked and exposed, neck and face to view, to the eyes of him with whom to us is the word.
{4:14} Having therefore a great chief priest, passed to the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, we should hold firmly the assent.
{4:15} For we have not a chief priest unable to suffer with our weaknesses; but tried in all things as a resemblance, without sin.
{4:16} We should therefore go with freedom of speech to the throne of grace, that we receive mercy, and find grace for timely assistance.
{5:1} For every chief priest taken from men is appointed for men for things to God, that he bring both gifts and sacrifices for sins:
{5:2} Being able to moderate the passions to the ignorant, and deceived; since he also is surrounded with weakness.
{5:3} And for this he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to bring in for sins.
{5:4} And not any takes this honour to himself; but the called of God, as also Aaron.
{5:5} So also Christ honoured not himself, to become chief priest; but he having spoken to him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.
{5:6} And also in another he says, Thou a priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec.
{5:7} Who in the days of his flesh, both prayers and supplications to him able to save him from death, with strong crying and tears, having offered, and listened to by means of circumspection;
{5:8} Although being a Son, he learned obedience from what he suffered;
{5:9} And being perfected, he became to all them lending a willing ear to him the origin of eternal salvation.
{5:10} Addressed by God the chief priest according to the order of Melchisedec.
{5:11} Of whom great is the word to us, and difficult of interpretation to speak, since ye have been sluggish in the hearing.
{5:12} For also ye ought to be teachers for the time, again ye have need for some one to teach you the elements of the beginning of the sayings of God; and have become those having need of milk, and not of firm food.
{5:13} For every one partaking of milk is inexperienced in the word of justice: for he is a child.
{5:14} And firm food is of the perfected, of them by habit having the senses exercised for the separation of good and evil.
{6:1} Therefore having left the word of the beginning of Christ, we should go on to perfection; not again laying down the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
{6:2} Of the teaching of immersions, and placing upon of hands, and of the rising up of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
{6:3} And this will we do, if God even permit.
{6:4} For impossible for them once enlightened, and having tasted of the heavenly gift, and having partaken of the Holy Spirit,
{6:5} And tasted of the good word of God, and powers of the life about to be,
{6:6} And having fallen, again to renew to repentance; crucifying to themselves the Son of God, and exposing to ignominy.
{6:7} For the earth drinking the rain coming often upon it, and bringing forth the vegetable fitting well to them by whom it is cultivated, receives commendation from God:
{6:8} And producing thorns and briers is rejected, after having been tried, and near cursing; whose end for destruction.
{6:9} And we have been persuaded of you, dearly beloved, of better things, and connected with salvation, if we also thus speak.
{6:10} For God is not unjust to forget your work and fatigue of love, which ye showed to his name, having served to the holy ones, and serving.
{6:11} And we desire each of you to show the same earnestness to the complete certainty of hope to the end:
{6:12} That ye be not sluggish, but imitators of them inheriting the promises by faith and longsuffering.
{6:13} For God promising to Abraham, since he had none greater to swear by, sware by himself,
{6:14} Saying, Truly will I praise thee, and multiplying will I multiply thee.
{6:15} And so, having endured long, he gained the promise.
{6:16} For truly men swear by the greater: and the oath for confirmation to them the end of all controversy.
{6:17} In which God, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of the promise the firmness of his counsel, he intervened by an oath:
{6:18} That by two unalterable deeds, in which it is impossible for God to deceive we might have a strong consolation, taking refuge in holding firmly the hope set before:
{6:19} Which we have as an anchor of the soul, unshaken and firm, and entering into that further within the veil.
{6:20} Where the forerunner, Jesus, went in for us, according to the order of Melchisedec, being a high priest forever.
{7:1} For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, having met Abraham returning from the cutting off of the kings, and praised him;
{7:2} To whom also Abraham divided a tenth from all; (first truly interpreted King of justice, and then also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
{7:3} Without father, without mother, of unknown origin, neither having beginning of days, nor end of life; and likened to the Son of God;) remains a priest perpetually.
{7:4} And behold how great this one, to whom also Abraham the patriarch gave the tenth of the first fruits.
{7:5} And they truly of the sons of Levi, receiving the office of priest, have a command to take a tenth part from the people according to the law, that is, from their brethren, although having come out of the loins of Abraham:
{7:6} And he not having his descent traced from them received a tenth from Abraham, and praised him having the promises.
{7:7} And without all controversy the less is praised of the better.
{7:8} And here truly dying men receive tenths; but there he, bearing witness that he lives.
{7:9} And as the word says, through Abraham, also Levi, receiving tenths, has paid a tenth.
{7:10} For yet was he in his father's loins, when Melchisedec met him.
{7:11} If truly therefore completion were by the Levitical priesthood, (for the people received legislation by it,) what further need according to the order of Melchisedec for another priest to be raised, and not according to the order of Aaron?
{7:12} For the priesthood being transferred, of necessity also is a transposition of law.
{7:13} For he of whom these things are said partook of another tribe, of which none held to the altar.
{7:14} For it is manifest that our Lord has sprung out of Judah; to which tribe Moses spake nothing of the priesthood.
{7:15} And it is yet more abundantly manifest: that according to the resemblance of Melchisedec has another priest risen,
{7:16} Who according to the law of a fleshly command was not born, but according to the power of an indestructible life.
{7:17} For he testifies, Thou a priest forever, according to the order of Melchisedec.
{7:18} For there is truly an annulling of the command going before by its weakness and unprofitableness.
{7:19} (For the law completed nothing,) but the bringing in of a better hope; by which we draw near to God.
{7:20} And as much as not without sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath:
{7:21} (For they truly without sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath became priests; but he with the sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath by him, saying to him, The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou priest forever, according to the order of Melchisedec:)
{7:22} According to this, Jesus has become security of a better covenant.
{7:23} And they truly are become many priests, by reason of death being hindered from remaining:
{7:24} And he, because he remains forever, has an inviolable priesthood.
{7:25} Wherefore he is able to save entirely those coming to God by him, always living to supplicate for them.
{7:26} For such a chief priest became us, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and being higher than the heavens;
{7:27} Who has no necessity according to the day, as the chief priests, before to bring up sacrifices for their own sins, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having brought up himself.
{7:28} For the law establishes men chief priests having weakness; but the word of the sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath, after the law, the Son, having been perfected forever.
{8:1} And the summary to the things spoken: We have such a chief priest, who sat on the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
{8:2} A workman of holy things, and of the true tent, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
{8:3} For every chief priest is appointed to bring in gifts and sacrifices also: wherefore it is necessary also for this to have something which he might bring.
{8:4} For if truly he were upon earth, he would not be a priest, there being priests bringing in gifts according to the law;
{8:5} Who serve the pattern and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was given an intimation of the divine will, being about to complete the tent: for, See, says he, thou make all things according to the type shewed thee in the mount.
{8:6} And now he has attained a more distinguished office, in how much also he is mediator of a better covenant, which was legislated upon better promises.
{8:7} For if that first was faultless, then place was not to be sought for the second.
{8:8} For rebuking them, he says, Behold, the days come, says the Lord, and I will complete for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah a new covenant:
{8:9} Not according to the covenant which I made to their fathers in the day of my taking their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they remained not in my covenant, and I heeded them not, says the Lord.
{8:10} For this the covenant which I will set to the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; giving my laws into their mind, and upon their hearts will I write them: and I will be to them for God, and they shall be to me for a people:
{8:11} And they should not teach each his neighbor, and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from their little even to their great ones.
{8:12} For I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins and their injustices will I remember no more.
{8:13} In saying new, he has made the first old. And that made old and becoming weak is near destruction.
{9:1} And truly therefore the first had precepts of divine service for him, and a worldly holy place.
{9:2} For the first tent was prepared; (in which was the chandelier, and table, and the setting up of the loaves;) which is called holy.
{9:3} And after the second veil, the tent called Holy of Holies;
{9:4} Having the golden censer, and ark of the covenant surrounded on all sides with gold, in which was the golden urn having the manna, and Aaron's rod having budded, and the tables of the covenant;
{9:5} And above it the cherubs of glory overshadowing the propitiatory; of which it is not now to speak in turn.
{9:6} And these thus prepared, truly to the first tent the priests always came in, to complete the divine services.
{9:7} And into the second the chief priest alone once a year, not without blood, which he brings near for himself, and the errors of the people:
{9:8} This the Holy Spirit designating, the way of the holies had not yet been made manifest, the first tent yet having a standing:
{9:9} Which a parable for the time placed in, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are brought near, not being able for consciousness to perfect him serving;
{9:10} Only in food and drinks, and different immersions, and precepts of the flesh, being placed till the time of amendment.
{9:11} And Christ being present, a chief priest of good things about to be, by a greater and more perfect tent, not made with hands, that is; not of this creation;
{9:12} Neither by the blood of he-goats and calves, and by his own blood he went in once for all to the holies, having found eternal deliverance.
{9:13} For if the blood of bulls and he-goats, and the ashes of a heifer besprinkling the polluted, consecrates to the purity of the flesh:
{9:14} How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself blameless to God, purify your consciousness from dead works to serve the living God?
{9:15} And for this he is mediator of a new covenant, that death having been, for redemption of the transgressions for the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
{9:16} For where a will, the necessity for the death of him having willed to be brought forward.
{9:17} For a will is firm by the dead: since it has no power when he having willed lives.
{9:18} Wherefore neither was the first consecrated without blood.
{9:19} For every command spoken according to law by Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of calves and he-goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and also the book, and he sprinkled all the people,
{9:20} Saying, This the blood of the covenant which God enjoined to you.
{9:21} And also the tent, and all the vessels of the service, he poured all over likewise with blood.
{9:22} And almost all things are purified according to the law with blood; and without blood-letting there is no remission.
{9:23} Therefore truly a necessity for the patterns of things in the heavens to be purified with these; and the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
{9:24} For Christ came not into the holy places made with hands, the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to be shown clearly to the face of God for us:
{9:25} Neither that he should offer himself many times, as the chief priest comes in to the holy places yearly with blood pertaining to others;
{9:26} (Since he must have suffered many times from the foundation of the world:) but now once at the termination of the times for the annulling of sin by the sacrifice of himself has he been shown clearly.
{9:27} And inasmuch as it is reserved to men once to die, and after this the judgment:
{9:28} So Christ, once offered to have borne the sins of many, of the second time, without sin, shall be seen to them expecting him for salvation.
{10:1} For the law having a shadow of good things about to be, not the same image of the things, with these sacrifices which they bring in yearly in continuance never can render perfect them coming thereto.
{10:2} For would they not have ceased to be brought in? because they serving have no more consciousness of sins, once purified.
{10:3} But in these, a reminding of sins yearly.
{10:4} For the blood of bulls and he-goats cannot take away sins.
{10:5} Wherefore coming into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering then wouldest not, but a body hast thou adjusted to me:
{10:6} And with whole burnt offering for sin wast thou not contented.
{10:7} Then said I, Behold, I am here (in the head of the book it was written of me,) O God, to do thy will.
{10:8} Farther back, saying, That sacrifice and bringing in and whole burnt offerings and for sin thou wouldest not, neither wert contented with; which are brought in according to law;
{10:9} Then he said, Behold, I am here to do, O God, thy will. He takes away the first, that he might set up the second.
{10:10} In which will we are consecrated by the bringing in of the body of Jesus Christ once.
{10:11} And truly every priest has stood daily, serving and bringing in many times the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
{10:12} But this, having brought in one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;
{10:13} As to the rest, awaiting till his enemies be put a footstool of his feet.
{10:14} For by one offering has he perfected forever the consecrated.
{10:15} And also the Holy Spirit testifies to us: for after having said before,
{10:16} This the covenant which I will establish with them after those days, says the Lord, giving my laws upon their heart, and upon their minds will I write them;
{10:17} And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
{10:18} And where remission of these, no more bringing in for sin.
{10:19} Having therefore, brethren, freedom of speech for the entering in of the holies by the blood of Jesus,
{10:20} A way publicly declared and living, which he consecrated to us, through the veil, that is, his flesh;
{10:21} And a great priest over the house of God;
{10:22} Let us approach with a true heart in complete certainty of faith, having our hearts be sprinkled from an evil consciousness, and having our bodies washed with pure water.
{10:23} We should hold the assent of hope not bending; (for faithful he having promised;)
{10:24} And we should observe one another for the incitement of love and good works:
{10:25} Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom to some; but beseeching: and by so much the more, inasmuch as ye see the day drawing near.
{10:26} For we sinning voluntarily after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there is left no more a sacrifice for sins,
{10:27} But a certain terrible expectation of judgment and jealousy of fire, being about to devour the adversaries.
{10:28} Any one having rejected Moses' law, without compassion dies by two or three witnesses:
{10:29} Of how much worse punishment, think ye, shall he be deemed worthy, having trodden down the Son of God, and deemed the blood of the covenant common, in which he was consecrated, and having outraged the Spirit of grace?
{10:30} For we know him having said, Vengeance to me, I will give back, says the Lord. And again, The Lord will judge his people.
{10:31} Terrible to fall into the hands of the living God.
{10:32} And recall to mind the former days, in which, having been enlightened, ye endured a great combat of sufferings;
{10:33} This, truly, being exposed to public view both by reproaches and pressures; and this, having been partakers of those thus overturned.
{10:34} For ye also suffered together with me in bonds, and received the pillage of your possessions with joy, knowing to have in yourselves a better and abiding substance in the heavens.
{10:35} Throw not away therefore your freedom of speech, which has great payment of reward.
{10:36} For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.
{10:37} For yet a little while only, he coming will come, and will not tarry.
{10:38} And the just one shall live by faith; but if he draw down, my soul is not contented in him.
{10:39} And we are not of drawing down to perdition; but of faith to the acquisition of the soul.
{11:1} And faith is the foundation of things hoped for, the proof of things not seen.
{11:2} For by this were the elders testified of.
{11:3} By faith we perceive that the times were adjusted by the word of God, so that things seen have been born not of things brought to light.
{11:4} By faith Abel brought near a greater sacrifice to God than Cain, by which he was testified of to be just, God testifying of his gifts; and by it he being dead yet speaks.
{11:5} By faith Enoch was transferred not to see death; and was not found, because God had transferred him: for before his transferring he had been testified of, to have pleased God.
{11:6} And without faith it is impossible to please: for he approaching to God must believe that he is, and is a remunerator to them seeking him out.
{11:7} By faith Noah, having an intimation of the divine will of things not yet seen, being circumspect, prepared an ark for the salvation of his house; by which he condemned the world, and by faith became an heir of justice.
{11:8} By faith Abraham, being called, listened, to go forth into the place which he was about to receive for an inheritance; and he came out, not knowing where he is coming.
{11:9} By faith he dwelt in the land of promise, as a strange land, having dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, co-heirs of the same promise:
{11:10} For he awaited a city having foundations, whose artificer and maker is God.
{11:11} By faith Sara also herself received power for the laying down of seed, and brought forth during the time of age, for she deemed him faithful having promised.
{11:12} Wherefore also from one were they born, and these of him having been dead, as the stars of heaven for multitude, and as the sand near the lip of the sea innumerable.
{11:13} According to faith died all these, not having received the promises, but having seen them from afar, and been persuaded, and having embraced, and assented that they are strangers and newly arrived from a foreign country upon earth.
{11:14} For they saying such things show clearly that they seek a country.
{11:15} And truly if they remembered that from which they came out, they had time to have returned.
{11:16} And now they feel an ardent desire for a better, that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed of them to be called their God: for he prepared for them a city.
{11:17} By faith Abraham had brought near Isaac, being tried: and he having received the promises brought near the only born,
{11:18} To whom it was spoken, That in Isaac shall seed be called to thee:
{11:19} Reckoning that God was also able to raise from the dead; whence he also received him in a parable.
{11:20} By faith concerning things about to be, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau.
{11:21} By faith Jacob, dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons; and worshipped, upon the extremity of his rod.
{11:22} By faith Joseph, dying, made mention of the departure of the sons of Israel: and charged concerning his bones.
{11:23} By faith Moses, born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw a shrewd child; and they were not afraid of the edict of the king.
{11:24} By faith Moses, having become great, refused to be reckoned the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
{11:25} Having chosen rather to be treated ill with the people of God, than to have the enjoyment of sin for a time;
{11:26} Having deemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than treasures in Egypt: for he looked to the payment of reward.
{11:27} By faith he forsook Egypt, not having feared the king's wrath: for, as seeing the invisible, he was strong.
{11:28} By faith he has kept the pascha, and the pouring out of blood, lest he destroying the first born should touch them.
{11:29} By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians having tried were swallowed down.
{11:30} By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been surrounded for seven days.
{11:31} By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with the unbelieving, having received the spies with peace.
{11:32} And what more do I say? for the time will fail me recounting of Gedeon, Barak, and also Samson and Jephthae; David also, and Samuel, and the prophets:
{11:33} Who by faith subdued kingdoms, wrought justice, attained the promises, shut up the mouths of lions,
{11:34} Quenched the power of fire, escaped the mouth of the sword, were strengthened from weakness, were strong in war, turned away the armies of strangers.
{11:35} Women received their dead from rising up: and others were beaten, not receiving redemption; that they might attain a better resurrection.
{11:36} And others received trial of jestings and scourges, and further, of bonds and imprisonment:
{11:37} They were stoned, they were cut by sawing, they were tried, they died by the slaughter of the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being in want, pressed, treated ill;
{11:38} (Of whom the world was not worthy:) wandering about in solitary places, and mountains, and caves, and holes of the earth.
{11:39} And these all, having been testified of by faith, received not the promise:
{11:40} God having foreseen something better for us, that without us they should not be completed.
{12:1} Wherefore we also having such a cloud of witnesses lying round about us, having laid down every weight, and sin easily captivating, by patience we should run the race set before us,
{12:2} Looking in the distance to Jesus the author and completer of the faith; who for the joy laid before him endured the cross, having despised the shame, and sat down on the right hand of the throne of God.
{12:3} For reckon over him having endured such contradiction of the sinful against himself, lest being harassed, ye labor in your souls.
{12:4} Ye have not yet resisted until blood, fighting against sin.
{12:5} And ye have totally forgotten the entreaty which is spoken to you as to sons, My son, neglect not the instruction of the Lord, nor be enervated being rebuked by him:
{12:6} For whom the Lord loves he corrects, and he chastises every son which he receives.
{12:7} If ye endure correction, God treats you as sons; for who is the son which the father corrects not?
{12:8} And if ye are without correction, of which all are partakers, then are ye spurious, not sons.
{12:9} Since we truly have fathers of our flesh instructors, and we were influenced: shall we not rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and we shall live?
{12:10} For they truly for a few days, according as it seemed to them, corrected; but he for profit, in order to partake in his holiness.
{12:11} And truly every correction for the present seems not to be for joy, but grief: and later it returns the peaceful fruit of justice to them being exercised by it.
{12:12} Wherefore set upright the relaxed hands, and palsied knees;
{12:13} And make straight wheel-ruts to your feet, lest the lame thing turned aside; and it should rather be healed.
{12:14} Follow peace with all, and consecration, without which none shall see the Lord:
{12:15} Observing narrowly lest any be failing of the grace of God: lest any root of bitterness springing forth aloft give trouble, and by this many be defiled;
{12:16} Lest any fornicator, or profane, as Esau, who for one act of eating sold his primogeniture.
{12:17} For ye know also afterwards, wishing to inherit the praise, he was disapproved of: for he found no place for a change of mind, although having sought it with tears.
{12:18} For ye have not come to the mount being handled, and burned with fire, and to duskiness, and to darkness, and to a violent storm,
{12:19} And to the sound of the trumpet, and the voice of words; which they, having heard, implored that the word be not put before them:
{12:20} (For they did not bear that being assigned, And if a beast should touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or shall be pierced with a missile weapon:
{12:21} And so dreadful was that being made to appear, Moses said, I am terrified and trembling:)
{12:22} But ye have come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,
{12:23} To the assembly of people, and church of the firstborn, transcribed in the heavens, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the just perfected,
{12:24} And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, speaking better things than Abel.
{12:25} See that ye refuse not him speaking. For if they escaped not, having refused him giving an intimation of the divine will on earth, much more we, who having turned back from him from the heavens:
{12:26} Whose voice then shook the earth: and now he has proclaimed, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also the heaven.
{12:27} And the Yet once more, makes manifest the transferring the things shaken, as of things made, that the things not being shaken might remain.
{12:28} Wherefore we receiving a kingdom unmoved; we should have grace by which we might serve God acceptably, with reverence and circumspection:
{12:29} For also our God is a consuming fire.
{13:1} Let brotherly love remain.
{13:2} Forget not hospitality: for by this some knew not having treated angels with friendship.
{13:3} Remember them in bonds as bound together with them; them treated ill, as the same being in the body.
{13:4} Marriage honoured in all, and the bed unpolluted: but fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
{13:5} The disposition exempt from avarice; being contented with present circumstances: for he has said, I will not send thee back, nor forsake thee.
{13:6} So that being confident, we say, The Lord aiding me, and I will not fear what man will do to me.
{13:7} Remember them guiding you, who spake to you the word of God: of whom, observing narrowly the issue of the mode of life, imitate the faith:
{13:8} Jesus Christ, yesterday, and to day the same, and for ever.
{13:9} With various and strange teachings be not carried about. For good the heart be rendered firm by grace; not by food, in which they having walked about were not profited.
{13:10} We have an altar, of which they serving the tent have no power to eat.
{13:11} For of whom the blood of the living ones is brought for sin into the holies by the chief priest, the bodies of these are burned without the camp.
{13:12} Wherefore also Jesus, that he might consecrate the people by his own blood, suffered without the camp.
{13:13} Therefore we should come to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
{13:14} For here have we no abiding city, but we seek that about to be.
{13:15} By him therefore we should always bring up the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of the lips assenting to his name.
{13:16} And the doing good and mutual participation forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
{13:17} Believe them guiding you, and yield: (for they watch vigilantly for your souls, as going to return the word.) that with joy they might do this, and not lamenting: for this unprofitable for you.
{13:18} Pray for us: for we have trusted that we have a good consciousness, in all things wishing to be well occupied.
{13:19} And I beseech the more abundantly to do this, that I might the more speedily be restored to you.
{13:20} And the God of peace, having brought up from the dead, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of the eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus Christ,
{13:21} Put you in proper order in every good work for doing his will, doing in you the thing pleasing before him, by Jesus Christ; to whom glory for the time of times. Amen.
{13:22} And I beseech you, brethren, hold up the word of entreaty: for I also sent to you in a few words.
{13:23} Ye know the brother Timothy having been set at liberty; with whom, if he come more speedily, I shall see you.
{13:24} Greet all them guiding you, and all the holy.
{13:25} They from Italy greet you. Grace with you all. Amen.
