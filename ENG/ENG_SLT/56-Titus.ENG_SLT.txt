{1:1} Paul, servant of God, and sent of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the chosen of God, and the acknowledgment of the truth according to devotion;
{1:2} In hope of eternal life, (which God, not false, promised before eternal times;
{1:3} And manifested his word in his own times, in the proclamation, which I was entrusted with according to the command of the Saviour our God;)
{1:4} To Titus, genuine child according to the common faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
{1:5} For this I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest rectify things left behind, and set elders in the city, as I directed thee:
{1:6} If any be irreproachable, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not in accusation of licentiousness, or disorderly.
{1:7} For a bishop must be irreproachable, as steward of God; not self-sufficient, not prone to anger, not intemperate, not a striker, not occupied in sordid gain.
{1:8} But hospitable, a lover of good, of sound mind, just, holy, holding firm;
{1:9} Holding firmly the faithful word according to instruction, that he may be able also to beseech in sound doctrine, and to refute those opposing.
{1:10} For many also are disorderly, vain talkers and infatuates, especially they of the circumcision:
{1:11} Who must be restrained, who subvert whole houses, teaching what they ought not, for the sake of sordid gain.
{1:12} A certain of them said, their own prophet, The Cretians always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies.
{1:13} This testimony is true. For this cause reprove them severely, that they may be sound in the faith;
{1:14} Not holding to Jewish fictions, and commands of men, having turned away from the truth.
{1:15} All things truly pure to the pure: and to the defiled and unbelieving nothing pure; but also their mind and consciousness are defiled.
{1:16} They confess to know God; and in works they deny, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work not tried.
{2:1} And do thou speak what becomes sound doctrine:
{2:2} The aged men to be sober, grave, of sound mind, sound in the faith, in love, in patience.
{2:3} The aged women likewise, becoming holy in a serene state of mind, not accusers, not slaves to much wine, teachers of good;
{2:4} That they render the young women discreet, to be lovers of the husband, lovers of the children,
{2:5} Of sound mind chaste, remaining at home, good subordinates to their own husbands, that the word of God be not defamed.
{2:6} The younger men likewise beseech to be of sound mind.
{2:7} Concerning all things hold thyself a type of good works: in doctrine, integrity, gravity, incorruptibility,
{2:8} The word sound, not to be condemned; that he from the opposite may be changed, having nothing bad to say of you.
{2:9} Servants to be subordinate to their own masters, to be pleasing in all things; not contradicting;
{2:10} Not purloining, but showing all good faith; that they may adorn the doctrine of the Saviour our God in all things.
{2:11} For the grace of God who saves, was manifested to all men,
{2:12} Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and eager worldly desires, we should live discreetly, and justly, and religiously, in the time now;
{2:13} Expecting the blessed hope, and appearance of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
{2:14} Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a distinguished people, zealous of good works.
{2:15} These things speak, and beseech, and reprove with all order. Let none despise thee.
{3:1} Remind them to be subordinate to beginnings and powers, to yield obedience to authority, to be prepared for every good work,
{3:2} To slander none, to be without fighting, equitable, showing all meekness to all men.
{3:3} For once we also were unwise disobedient, deceived, being slaves to eager desires and various pleasures, living in vexation and envy, hated, and hating one another.
{3:4} And when the kindness and philanthropy of our Saviour God was made evident,
{3:5} Not of works in justice which we did; but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and the renovation of the Holy Spirit;
{3:6} Which he poured out upon us richly by Jesus Christ our Saviour;
{3:7} That justified by his grace, we might be heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
{3:8} Faithful the word, and I wish for thee to be assured of these things, that they having believed God might turn their thoughts to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable to men.
{3:9} And foolish questions, and genealogies, and strifes, and conflicts pertaining to the law, avoid; for they are unprofitable and vain.
{3:10} A man, a heretic after one and the second admonition, reject;
{3:11} Knowing such to be turned back, and he sins, being self-condemned.
{3:12} When I shall send Artemas to thee, or Tychicus, be earnest to come to me at Nicopolis: for there have I chosen to pass the winter.
{3:13} Send forward zealously Zenas pertaining to the law, and Apollos, that nothing fail them.
{3:14} And let ours also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
{3:15} All they with me greet thee. Greet them loving us in the faith. Grace with you all. Amen.
