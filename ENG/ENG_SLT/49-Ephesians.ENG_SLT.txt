{1:1} Paul, sent of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the holy ones being in Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
{1:2} Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ,
{1:3} Praised be God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, he having praised us in every spiritual praise in heavenly things in Christ:
{1:4} As he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, for us to be holy and blameless before him in love:
{1:5} Having determined us beforehand for adoption as a son by Jesus Christ to him, according to benevolence of his will,
{1:6} To the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he rendered us acceptable in the beloved.
{1:7} In whom we have redemption by his blood, the letting go of faults, according to the riches of his grace;
{1:8} In which he abounded to us in all wisdom and intelligence;
{1:9} Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his benevolence which he purposed in himself:
{1:10} For the arrangement of the completion of the times, to unite in a whole all things in Christ, both the things in the heavens, and the things upon earth; in him:
{1:11} In whom also we were cast by lot, determined beforehand according to the purpose of him performing all things according to the counsel of his will:
{1:12} For us to be to the praise of his glory, who before hoped in Christ.
{1:13} In whom ye also, having heard the word of truth, the good news of your salvation: in whom also having believed, ye were sealed by the holy Spirit of solemn promise,
{1:14} Which is the pledge of our inheritance for the redemption of the acquisition, to the praise of his glory.
{1:15} For this, I also, having heard the faith among you in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the holy,
{1:16} Cease not returning thanks for you, making remembrance of you in my prayers;
{1:17} That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, might give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in his knowledge:
{1:18} The eyes of your understanding enlightened; for you to know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the holy ones,
{1:19} And what the surpassing greatness of his power to us believing, according to the action of the might of his strength,
{1:20} Which he performed in Christ, having raised him from the dead, and he sat on his right hand in the heavenlies,
{1:21} Above every beginning, and authority, and power, and property, and every name named, not only in this life, but in that about to be:
{1:22} And placed all things under his, feet, and gave him head over all things to the church,
{1:23} Which is his body, the completion of him completing all things in all.
{2:1} And ye being dead in faults and in sins;
{2:2} In which when ye walked according to the life of this world, according to the ruler of the power of the air, of the spirit now energetic in the sons of disobedience:
{2:3} Among whom also we then all occupied ourselves in the eager desire? of our flesh, doing the wills of the flesh and the thoughts; and were by nature children of wrath, as also the rest.
{2:4} But God, being rich in mercy, by his much love which he loved us,
{2:5} And we being dead in faults, he made alive together with Christ, (by grace are ye saved;)
{2:6} And raised together, and seated together in heavenlies in Christ Jesus:
{2:7} That he might show in times coming the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
{2:8} For by grace are ye saved through faith; and this not of you: the gift of God:
{2:9} Not of works, lest any one should boast.
{2:10} For we are his work, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.
{2:11} Wherefore remember, that ye then the nations in the flesh, being reckoned Uncircumcision by the Circumcision in the flesh reckoned made by hands;
{2:12} That ye were in that time without Christ alienated from the citizenship of Israel, and foreigners from the covenants of solemn promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:
{2:13} And now in Christ Jesus ye who then being far off have become near in the blood of Christ.
{2:14} For he is our peace, having made both one, and having loosed the middle partition wall of the enclosure;
{2:15} The enmity in his flesh, the law of commands in enactments, having left unemployed; that he might create in himself one new man, making peace;
{2:16} And that he might reconcile anew both in one body to God by the cross, having slain the enmity in it:
{2:17} And having come, he announced good news, peace to you afar off, and to those near.
{2:18} For by him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.
{2:19} Wherefore then are ye no more foreigners and sojourners, but fellow citizens of the holy, and the household of God;
{2:20} Built upon the foundation of the sent, and of the prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the corner stone;
{2:21} In whom all the building fitted together increases into a holy temple in the Lord:
{2:22} In whom also ye are builded together for the dwelling of God in the Spirit.
{3:1} For this, I Paul, the imprisoned of Christ Jesus for you the nations,
{3:2} If ye have heard of the distribution of the grace of God given to me for you:
{3:3} That by revelation he made Known to me the mystery; (as I before wrote briefly,
{3:4} By which ye, reading, can perceive My understanding in the mystery of Christ,)
{3:5} Which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as now has been revealed to his holy sent and to the prophets by the Spirit:
{3:6} For the nations to be co-heirs, and united in one body, and, participators of his solemn promise in Christ by the good news:
{3:7} Of which I Became a servant, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me according to the energy of his power.
{3:8} To me, the least of all the holy ones, was this grace given, to announce the good news in the nations, the untraceable riches of Christ.
{3:9} And to enlighten all what the distribution of the mystery, concealed from times immemorial in God, having created all things by Jesus Christ:
{3:10} That it might now be made known to beginnings and powers in the heavenlies by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
{3:11} According to the purpose of times immemorial which he made in Christ Jesus our Lord:
{3:12} In whom we have freedom of speech and access with confidence by his faith.
{3:13} Wherefore I desire not to lose courage in my pressures for you, which is your glory.
{3:14} For this I bend my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
{3:15} Of whom all the family in the heavens and upon earth is named,
{3:16} That he might give to you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the interior man;
{3:17} For Christ to dwell by faith in your hearts; in love being rendered firm, and the foundation laid,
{3:18} That ye might be fully able to comprehend with all the holy what the length, and breadth, and depth, and height;
{3:19} To know also the love of Christ, surpassing knowledge, that ye might be filled in all the fulness of God.
{3:20} And to him being able to do above all things more abundantly above what we ask or think, according to the power being energetic in us,
{3:21} To him the glory in the church in Christ Jesus to all generations of the times of times. Amen.
{4:1} Therefore I, the imprisoned in the Lord, beseech you to walk Worthy of the calling which ye were called,
{4:2} With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing one another in love;
{4:3} Striving earnestly to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
{4:4} One body, and one Spirit, as also ye were called in one hope of your calling;
{4:5} One Lord, one faith, one immersion,
{4:6} One God and Father of all, who over all, and through all, and in you all.
{4:7} And to each one of us was grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
{4:8} Wherefore he says, Having ascended into height, he made captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.
{4:9} (And so having ascended, what is it except that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
{4:10} He having descended is the same having ascended above all the heavens, that he might fill up all things.)
{4:11} And truly he gave the sent; and the prophets; and the bearers of good tidings; and the shepherds, and the teachers;
{4:12} For the adjusting of the holy, for the work of the service, for the building up of the body of Christ:
{4:13} Until we all arrive to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to the perfect man, to the measure of age of the filling up of Christ.
{4:14} That we be no more babes, tossed about, and carried around by every wind of doctrine, in the playing at dice of men, in craft, with the artifice of deceit;
{4:15} And speaking the truth in love, let us grow up into him in all things, who is the head, Christ:
{4:16} From whom all the body fitted together and joined together by every touch of the expenditure, according to the energy in measure of one of each part, makes the increase of the body to the building up of itself in love.
{4:17} Therefore this I say, and testify in the Lord, that ye no more walk as also the rest of the nations, in the vanity of their mind,
{4:18} Being darkened in understanding, alienated from the life of God by ignorance being in them, by the hardness of their heart;
{4:19} Who no longer having had feeling delivered themselves to licentiousness, to the work of all uncleanness in overreaching.
{4:20} And ye have not so learned Christ;
{4:21} If ye heard him, and were taught in him, as is the truth in Jesus:
{4:22} For you to put away according to the former mode of life the old man, corrupted according to the eager desires of deceit;
{4:23} And to be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
{4:24} And to put on the new man, created according to God in justice and sanctity of truth.
{4:25} Wherefore falsehood ye having put away, speak the truth each with his neighbor: for ye are members one of another.
{4:26} Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your fit of anger:
{4:27} Neither give place to the accuser.
{4:28} He stealing let him steal no more: and rather let him be wearied from fatigue, working good with the hands, that he have to impart to him having need.
{4:29} Let not any foul word go out of your mouth, but if any good to the building of necessity, that it might give grace to them hearing.
{4:30} And grieve ye not the Holy Spirit of God in which ye were sealed to the day of redemption.
{4:31} Let all harshness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and slander, be put away from you, with all badness:
{4:32} And be ye kind one to another, having good bowels, favoring each other, as also God in Christ Jesus favored you.
{5:1} Be ye therefore imitators of God, as dearly beloved children;
{5:2} And walk ye in love, as also Christ loved us, and gave himself for us a gift and sacrifice to God for a smell of sweet odor.
{5:3} And fornication, and all uncleanness, or overreaching, let it not be named with you, as becomes the holy;
{5:4} And obscenity, and silly discourse, or wit, which things concern not; but rather thankfulness.
{5:5} For this ye are knowing, that every fornicator, or unclean, or covetous person, who is an idolater, has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
{5:6} Let none lead you astray with vain words: for by these things comes the anger of God upon the sons of disobedience.
{5:7} Be ye not therefore partakers with them.
{5:8} For ye were then darkness, and now light in the Lord: walk ye as children of light:
{5:9} (For the fruit of the Spirit in all goodness and justice and truth;)
{5:10} Trying what is pleasing to the Lord.
{5:11} And participate not with the unfruitful works of darkness, and rather also confute.
{5:12} For the things done secretly by them it is also shameful to speak.
{5:13} And all things refuted, by light are made manifest: for everything made manifest is light.
{5:14} Wherefore he says, Awake, who sleeping, and arise from the dead, and Christ will enlighten thee.
{5:15} See therefore how ye walk accurately, not as unwise, but as wise,
{5:16} Making purchase of time, for the days are evil.
{5:17} For this be not foolish, but understanding what the will of the Lord.
{5:18} And be not drunk with wine, in which is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit;
{5:19} Speaking to yourselves on harps, and songs, and spiritual odes, singing and playing on the harp in your heart to the Lord;
{5:20} Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father;
{5:21} Yielding obedience to one another in the fear of God.
{5:22} Women, yield ye obedience to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
{5:23} For the husband is the head of the wife, as also Christ the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.
{5:24} But as the church is subjected to Christ, so also wives to their own husbands in everything.
{5:25} Husbands, love your own wives, as also Christ loved the church, and delivered himself up for it;
{5:26} That he might consecrate it, having cleansed by the washing of water in the word,
{5:27} That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing: but that it be holy and blameless.
{5:28} So ought men to love their own wives as their own bodies. He loving his wife, loves himself.
{5:29} For none at any time hates his own flesh; but brings it up and cherishes it, as also the Lord the church:
{5:30} For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
{5:31} For this a man shall leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
{5:32} This is a great mystery: but I speak to Christ and to the church.
{5:33} But ye also altogether, let each so love his own wife as himself: and the wife that she fear her husband.
{6:1} Children, listen to your parents in the Lord: for this is just.
{6:2} Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first command with solemn promise;)
{6:3} That it may be well to thee, and thou mayest be long time upon earth.
{6:4} And, fathers, be not angry with your children: but bring them up in the instruction and reminding of the Lord.
{6:5} Servants, listen to lords according to the flesh, with fear and tremor, in simplicity of your heart, as to Christ;
{6:6} Not with eye-service, as menpleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul:
{6:7} With affection serving the Lord, and not men.
{6:8} Knowing that whatever good each might do, this he shall receive from the Lord, whether a servant or free.
{6:9} And, lords, do ye the same things to them, letting go threatening: knowing that also your own Lord is in the heavens; and distinction of persons is not with him.
{6:10} As to the rest, my brethren, be strengthened in the Lord, and in the strength of his power.
{6:11} Put on the complete armor of God, for you to be able to stand against the artifices of the accuser.
{6:12} For the wrestling is not to us against blood and flesh, but against beginnings, against powers, against the chiefs of the world of darkness of this life, against spiritual things of wickedness in heavenly things.
{6:13} For this take up the complete armor of God, that ye might be able to withstand in the evil day, and having effected all things, to stand.
{6:14} Stand therefore, having girded your loins around with truth, and put on the armor of justice;
{6:15} And fastened under the feet in preparation of the good news of peace;
{6:16} Over all, having taken the shield of faith, in which ye shall be able to quench all the inflamed darts of evil.
{6:17} And take ye the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
{6:18} By all prayer and supplication praying in all time in Spirit, and for this same watching vigilantly in all perseverance and supplication for the holy:
{6:19} And for me, that the word might be given me, in the opening of my mouth in freedom of speech, to make known the mystery of the good news,
{6:20} For which I am an ambassador in perplexity: that in it I might speak freely, as I ought to speak.
{6:21} And that ye also might know the things concerning me, what I do, Tychicus will make all things known to you, the dearly beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord:
{6:22} Whom I sent to you for this same, that ye might know the things concerning us, and he might comfort your hearts.
{6:23} Peace to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
{6:24} Grace with all loving our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibleness. Amen.
