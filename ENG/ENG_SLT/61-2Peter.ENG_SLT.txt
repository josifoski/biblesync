{1:1} Simon Peter, servant and sent of Jesus Christ, to them having received by inheritance equally honoured faith with us in the justice of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:
{1:2} May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
{1:3} As his divine power having bestowed upon us all things which for life and devotion, by the knowledge of him having called us by glory and fitness:
{1:4} (By which the greatest and precious promises are bestowed upon us: that by these ye might be having escaped from the corruption in the world through eager desires.)
{1:5} And also this same, having brought in at the side all earnestness, furnish in addition in your faith fitness; and In fitness knowledge;
{1:6} And in knowledge self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience devotion;
{1:7} And in devotion brotherly love; and in brotherly love, love.
{1:8} For these being to you, and abounding, they establish you not without effort, neither unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
{1:9} For in whom these are not present, he is blind, being affected with shortness of sight, having taken forgetfulness of the cleansing formerly of his sins.
{1:10} Wherefore rather, brethren, be earnest to have your calling and selection made firm: for doing these, ye should not once stumble:
{1:11} For so shall an entrance be furnished richly to you in addition into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
{1:12} Wherefore I will not neglect to remind you always of these things, though having known, and being supported in the present truth.
{1:13} And I deem just, in as far as I am in this tent, to arouse you by putting in mind;
{1:14} Knowing that the laying aside of my tent is swift; as also our Lord Jesus Christ manifested to me.
{1:15} And I shall also be earnest for you always to have, after my exit, this putting in mind to be done.
{1:16} For not having followed ingeniously contrived fictions, we made known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but having been spectators of his majesty.
{1:17} For having received from God the Father honour and glory, and such a voice brought to him from the magnificent glory, This is my dearly beloved Son, in whom I was contented.
{1:18} And this voice brought from heaven we heard, being with him in the holy mountain.
{1:19} And we have the prophetic word more firm; which holding to, ye do well, as to a light shining in a dusty place, even till the day shine through, and the morning star spring up in your hearts:
{1:20} Knowing this first, that every prophecy of the writing is not of private solution.
{1:21} For prophecy was not once brought by the will of man: but holy men of God spake, being moved by the Holy Spirit.
{2:1} And also were there false prophets among the people, as also among you shall be false teachers, who shall privately bring in doctrines of perdition, and denying the master having purchased them, having brought upon themselves swift destruction.
{2:2} (And many shall follow their licentiousness; by whom the way of truth shall be defamed.)
{2:3} And by covetousness with feigned words shall trade in you: to whom judgment since a long while is not inactive, and their perdition sleeps not.
{2:4} For if God spared not the angels having sinned, but delivered up, hurled into Tartarus, to cords of darkness, having been kept for judgment;
{2:5} And spared not the old world, but Noah the eighth, a herald of justice, he watched, having brought an inundation upon the world of the irreligious;
{2:6} And the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha having reduced to ashes, condemned with a catastrophe, a pattern set to them about to act irreligiously;
{2:7} And just Lot, being harassed by the licentiousness of the lawless for the turning back, he delivered:
{2:8} (For the just one in seeing and hearing, dwelling among them, from day to day tried the just soul with lawless works;)
{2:9} The Lord knows to deliver the religious out of temptation, and to keep the unjust restrained for the day of judgment;
{2:10} And chiefly them going after the flesh in eager desire of defilement, and despising dominion. Self-sufficient, rash men, they tremble not, defaming glories.
{2:11} Where angels, being greater in strength and power, bring not defaming judgment against them to the Lord.
{2:12} But these, as natural irrational living creatures, having been for catching and destroying, defaming in what things they are ignorant of; and shall be destroyed in their corruption;
{2:13} Receiving the reward of injustice, deeming luxurious indulgence pleasure in the day. Spots and blemishes, rioting in their deceits, feasting together with you.
{2:14} Having eyes full of an adulteress, not ceasing from sin; decoying unstable souls: having a heart exercised with covetousness; children of a curse:
{2:15} Having forsaken the straight way, they were led astray, having followed in the way of Balaam son of Bosor, who loved the reward of injustice;
{2:16} And he had reprehension for his own iniquity: the dumb ass speaking in man's voice impeded the insanity of the prophet.
{2:17} These are fountains wanting water, clouds impelled by a hurricane; for whom the obscurity of darkness has been kept forever.
{2:18} For speaking excessive things of vanity, they decoy with the eager desires of the flesh, for licentiousness, them having truly escaped from those turned back in error.
{2:19} Promising them liberty, they being servants of corruption: for by whom any is conquered, by him has he been made to serve.
{2:20} For if having escaped the pollutions of the world by the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and again entangling with these, they be conquered, the last things have been to them worse than the first.
{2:21} For it was better for them not to have known the way of justice, than, having known, to turn back from the holy command delivered to them.
{2:22} And that of the true proverb has happened to them, The dog having turned back to his own vomit; and the sow having been washed to the rolling of the mire.
{3:1} Now this, dearly beloved, the second epistle I write to you; in which I awaken your pure mind by putting in remembrance:
{3:2} To remember the words spoken before by the holy prophets, and the command of us the sent of the Lord and Saviour:
{3:3} Knowing this first, that in the last of the days shall mockers come for deceiving, going according to their own eager desires,
{3:4} And saying, Where is the solemn promise of his presence? for from the time the fathers were set to sleep, so continue all things from the beginning of creation.
{3:5} For being willing this is unknown to them, that the heavens were a long while ago, and the earth having stood out of water and by water, by the word of God:
{3:6} By which then the world, overflowed with water, perished:
{3:7} And now the heavens and the earth, by the same word are stored up, being kept for fire to the day of judgment and of the perdition of irreligious men.
{3:8} And let not this one thing be unknown to you, dearly beloved, that one day with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
{3:9} The Lord puts not off the solemn promise, as some deem slowness; but is longsuffering to us, not willing any to perish, but all should have room for repentance.
{3:10} And the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens shall pass away with a loud noise, and the elements, suffering from excessive heat, shall be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it shall be burned down.
{3:11} Therefore all these being dissolved, of what race ought ye to be in holy turning round and devotion,
{3:12} Expecting and seeking earnestly the presence of the day of God, during which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements going to be burned are melted away?
{3:13} But we expect new heavens and a new earth, according to promise, in which dwells justice.
{3:14} Wherefore, dearly beloved, expecting these, be earnest, spotless and blameless, to be found by him in peace.
{3:15} And the longsuffering of our Lord deem ye salvation; as also our dearly beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you;
{3:16} As also in all the epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things difficult to understand, which the unlearned and unstable pervert, as also the rest of the writings, to their own perdition.
{3:17} You therefore, dearly beloved, knowing beforehand, watch, lest, led away by the error of the lawless, ye fall from your own stability.
{3:18} And grow ye in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him the glory now and to the day of eternity. Amen.
