{1:1} And king David was old, going in days; and they will cover him with garments, and he will not be warm.
{1:2} And his servants will say to him, They shall seek for my lord the king a girl, a virgin, and she standing before the king, and she shall be to him an associate, and lying in thy bosom, and it shall be warm to my lord the king.
{1:3} And they will seek a fair girl in all the bound of Israel, and they will find Abishag the Shunamite, and they will bring her to the king.
{1:4} And the girl fair, even exceedingly, and she will be to the king an associate, and she will serve him: and the king knew her not.
{1:5} And Adonijah, son of Haggith being lifted up, saying, I will reign; and he will make to himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
{1:6} And his father grieved him not from his days, saying, Wherefore didst thou thus? and he good of form, exceedingly; and she bare him after Absalom.
{1:7} And his words will be with Joab, son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest; and they will help after Adonijah.
{1:8} And Zadok the priest, and Benaiah, son of Jehoida, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty which were to David, were not with Adonijah.
{1:9} And Adonijah will sacrifice sheep and oxen and the fatling, by the stone of Zoheleth, which is next the fountain of the fuller, and he will call all his brethren the king's sons, and for all the men of Judah the king's servants:
{1:10} And Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
{1:11} And Nathan will say to Bathsheba, saying, Didst thou not hear that Adonijah son of Haggith reigned, and David our lord knew not?
{1:12} Come now, advising, I will now advise thee, and save thou thy soul and the soul of thy son Solomon.
{1:13} Come, go in to king David, and say to him, My lord the king, didst thou not swear to thy servant, saying, That Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? and wherefore did Adonijah reign?
{1:14} Behold thee yet speaking with the king, and I will come in after thee and complete thy words.
{1:15} And Bath-sheba will go in to the king to the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunamite serving the king.
{1:16} And Bath-sheba will bow and worship to the king, and the king will say, What to thee?
{1:17} And she will say to him, My lord, thou didst swear by Jehovah thy God to thy servant that Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
{1:18} And now, behold, Adonijah reigning; and now my lord the king knew not:
{1:19} And he will sacrifice oxen and the fatling, and sheep for multitude, and he will call to all the sons of the king, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab, chief of the army: and Solomon thy servant he called not.
{1:20} And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee to announce to them who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him.
{1:21} And being when my lord the king lies down with his fathers, I and my son Solomon being the sinful.
{1:22} And behold her yet speaking with the king, and Nathan the prophet came in.
{1:23} And they will announce to the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And he will come in before the king, and he will worship to the king upon his face to the earth.
{1:24} And Nathan will say, My lord the king, saidst thou Adonijah shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne?
{1:25} For he went down this day, and he will sacrifice oxen and the fatling, and sheep for multitude, and he will call to all the king's sons, and for the chief of the army, and for Abiathar the priest, and behold them eating and drinking before him, and they will say, King Adonijah shall live.
{1:26} And for me, me thy servant, and for Zadok the priest, and for Benaiah son of Jehoida, and for Solomon thy servant, he called not.
{1:27} If from my lord the king was this word, and thou madest not known to thy servant who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him?
{1:28} And king David will answer and say, Call to me for Bath-sheba. And she will come in before the king and stand before the king.
{1:29} And the king will swear, and say, Jehovah lives who redeemed my soul from all straits.
{1:30} For us I swear to thee by Jehovah the God of Israel, saying that Solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne instead of me; for so I will do this day.
{1:31} And Bath-sheba will bow the face to the earth and worship to the king, and say, My lord king David shall live forever,
{1:32} And king David will say, Call to me for Zadok the priest, and for Nathan the prophet, and for Benaiah the son of Jehoida. And they will come in before the king.
{1:33} And the king will say to them, Take with you the servants of your lord and cause Solomon my son to ride upon the mule which is to me, and bring down to Gihon:
{1:34} And Zadok the priest anointed him there, and Nathan the prophet, for king over Israel: and strike ye upon the trumpet and say, King Solomon shall live.
{1:35} And come up after him, and he coming, and he shall sit upon my throne, and he shall reign instead of me: and I commanded him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
{1:36} And Benaiah, son of Jehoida, will answer the king and say, Verily: so will Jehovah say, the God of my lord the king.
{1:37} As Jehovah was with my lord the king, so will he be with Solomon, and he will magnify his throne above the throne of my lord, king David.
{1:38} And Zadok the priest will go down, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoida, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and they will cause Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and they will cause him to go to Gihon.
{1:39} And Zadok the priest will take a horn of oil from the tent and will anoint Solomon; and they will strike upon the trumpet, and all the people will say, King Solomon shall live.
{1:40} And all the people will go up after him, and the people piping with pipes and rejoicing with great joy, and the earth will break forth with their voice.
{1:41} And Adonijah will hear, and all being called with him, and they finished eating. And Joab will hear the voice of the trumpet, and say, Wherefore the voice of the city put in motion?
{1:42} He yet speaking, and behold, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest came in; and Adonijah will say, Come in, for thou a man of strength, and thou wilt announce good news.
{1:43} And Jonathan will answer and say to Adonijah, Truly our lord king David made Solomon king.
{1:44} And the king will send with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoida, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and they will cause him to ride upon the kings mule:
{1:45} And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet will anoint him for king in Gihon: and they will go up from thence rejoicing, and the city will be put in motion: this the voice which ye heard.
{1:46} And also Solomon will sit upon the throne of the kingdom.
{1:47} And also the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying. Thy God will do good to the name of Solomon above thy name, and he will magnify his throne above thy throne. And the king will worship upon the bed.
{1:48} And also thus will the king say, Blessed Jehovah the God of Israel who gave this day him sitting upon my throne, and mine eyes seeing.
{1:49} And all the called that were to Adonijah will tremble, and will rise and go, a man to his way.
{1:50} And Adonijah will, be afraid of the face of Solomon, and he will rise and go, and lay hold upon the horns of the altar.
{1:51} And it will be announced to Solomon, saving, Behold, Adonijah was afraid of king Solomon, and behold, he seized upon the horns of the altar, saying, Will king Solomon swear to me according to the day if he will kill his servant with the sword?
{1:52} And Solomon will say, If he will be for a son of strength there shall not fall of his hairs to the earth: and if evil shall be found in him and he shall die.
{1:53} And king Solomon will send and they will bring him down from the altar. And he will come and worship to king Solomon: and Solomon will say to him, Go to thy house.
{2:1} And the days of David will draw near to die; and he will command Solomon his son, saying,
{2:2} I go in the way of all the earth: and be thou strong, and be for a man;
{2:3} And watch the watches of Jehovah thy God, to go in his ways, to watch his laws, his commands and his judgments, and his testimonies, as written in the law of Moses, so that thou shalt consider all that thou shalt do and all Where thou shalt turn there:
{2:4} So that Jehovah shall raise up his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy sons shall watch their way to go before me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul, saying, There shall not be cut off to thee a man from the throne of Israel.
{2:5} And also thou knewest what Joab on of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two chiefs of the armies of Israel, to Abner son of Ner, and to Amasa son of Jether; and he will kill them and put the bloods of war in peace, and give the bloods of war upon his girdle which was upon his loins, and in his shoe upon his feet.
{2:6} And do according to thy wisdom, and thou wilt not bring down his gray hairs in peace to hades.
{2:7} And to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite thou shalt do mercy, and they shall be of those eating at thy table: for so they came near to me in my fleeing from the face of Absalom thy brother.
{2:8} And behold, with thee Shimei, son of Gera, a Benjamite, of Bahurim; and he cursed me a strong curse in the day I went to the two camps and he came down to my meeting at Jordan, and I will swear to him by Jehovah, saying, If I shall kill thee with the sword.
{2:9} And now thou shalt not let him go unpunished; for thou a wise man, and thou knowest what thou wilt do to him; and bring down his gray hairs with blood to hades.
{2:10} And David will lie down with his fathers, and be buried in the city of David.
{2:11} And the days that David reigned over Israel, forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years.
{2:12} And Solomon will sit upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom will be protected greatly.
{2:13} And Adonijah son of Haggith, will come to Bath-sheba, Solomon's mother: and she will say, Thy coming peace? And he will say, Peace.
{2:14} And he will say, A word to me for thee. And she will say, Speak.
{2:15} And he will say, Thou knewest that to me was the kingdom, and upon me all Israel set their faces for king: and the kingdom will turn about and be for my brother, for from Jehovah it was to him.
{2:16} And now I ask one asking from thee, thou wilt not turn away my face. And she will say to him, Speak.
{2:17} And he will say, Speak now to Solomon the king, for he will not turn away thy face, and he will give to me Abishag the Shunamite for wife.
{2:18} And Bathsheba will say, Well I will speak for thee to the king.
{2:19} And Bathsheba will go to king Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king will rise up to her meeting, and worship to her, and he sat upon his throne, and a throne will be set for the king's mother; and she will sit at his right hand.
{2:20} And she will say, One small asking I ask from thee; thou wilt not turn away my face. And the king will say to her, Ask, my mother, for I will not turn away thy face.
{2:21} And she will say, Give Abishag the Shunamite to Adonijah thy brother for wife.
{2:22} And king Solomon will answer, and say to his mother, And wherefore didst thou ask Abishag the Shunamite for Adonijah? And ask for him the kingdom, for he my brother, the great above me; and for him Abiathar the priest, and Joab son of Zeruiah.
{2:23} And king Solomon will swear by Jehovah, saying, Thus will God do to me, and thus will he add, for Adonijah spoke this word against his soul.
{2:24} And now Jehovah lives who prepared me, and he will set me upon the throne of David my father, and who made for me a house as he spake, for this day Adonijah shall die.
{2:25} And king Solomon will send by the hand of Benaiah, son of Jehoida, and he will strike upon him and he will die.
{2:26} And to Abiathar the priest the king said, Go to Anathoth upon thy field: for thou a man of death: and in this day will not kill thee, for thou didst lift up the ark of the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou wert afflicted in all which my father was afflicted.
{2:27} And Solomon will drive out Abiathar from being priest to Jehovah, to complete the word of Jehovah which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
{2:28} And the report came even to Joab: (for Joab turned after Adonijah, and after Absalom he turned not;) and Joab will flee to the tent of Jehovah and will lay hold upon the horns of the altar.
{2:29} And it will be announced to king Solomon that Joab fled to the tent of Jehovah; and behold, by the altar. And Solomon will send Benaiah son of Jehoida, saying, Go strike upon him.
{2:30} And Benaiah will go to the tent of Jehovah, and say to him, Thus said the king, Come forth. And he will say, Nay; for here will I die. And Benaiah will turn back the king word, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
{2:31} And the king will say to him, Do as he said, and strike upon him, and bury him; and take away the bloods which Joab shed gratuitously, from me and from my father's house.
{2:32} And Jehovah turned back his blood upon his head, who struck upon two just men and good above him, and he will kill them with the sword, and my father David knew not, Abner son of Ner, chief of the army of Israel, and Amasa, son of Jether, chief of the army of Judah.
{2:33} And their bloods shall turn back upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his seed forever: and to David and to his seed and to his house and to his throne shall be peace even forever, from Jehovah.
{2:34} And Benaiah son of Jehoida will go up, and will strike upon him and will kill him: and he will be buried in his house in the desert.
{2:35} And the king will give Benaiah son of Jehoida instead of him over the army: and Zadok the priest, the king gave instead of Abiathar.
{2:36} And the king will send and call for Shimei, and say to him, Build for thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and thou shalt not go forth from thence, whither and whither.
{2:37} For being in the day of thy going forth, and thou didst pass the torrent Kidron, knowing, thou shalt know that dying, thou shalt die: thy blood shall be upon thy head.
{2:38} And Shimei will say, Good the word: according to what my lord the king spake, thus will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
{2:39} And it will be from the end of three years, and two servants to Shimei, will flee to Achish, son of Maachah, king of Gath: and they will announce to Shimci, saying, Behold, thy servants in Gath.
{2:40} And Shimei will rise and saddle his ass, and go to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei will go and bring his servants from Gath.
{2:41} And it will be announced to Solomon that Shimei went from Jerusalem to Gath, and he will turn back.
{2:42} And the king will send and call for Shimei, and say to him, Did not I cause thee to swear by Jehovah, and attest to thee, saying, In the day of thy going forth, and thou wentest whither and whither, knowing, thou shalt know that dying, thou shalt die? and thou wilt say to me, Good the word I heard.
{2:43} And wherefore didst thou not watch the oath of Jehovah, and the command which I commanded upon thee?
{2:44} And the king will say to Shimei, Thou knewest all the evil which thy heart knew, which thou didst to David my father: and Jehovah turned back thy evil upon thy head.
{2:45} And blessed be kind Solomon, and the throne of David shall be prepared before Jehovah, even forever.
{2:46} And the king will command Benaiah son of Jehoida, and he will go forth and will strike upon him, and he will die. And the kingdom was prepared in the hand of Solomon.
{3:1} And Solomon will contract marriage with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he will take Pharaoh's daughter and bring her to the city of David till he finished building his house, and the house of Jehovah and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
{3:2} Only the people sacrificing in heights, for there was not a house, built to the name of Jehovah even to these days.
{3:3} And Solomon will love Jehovah, going in the laws of David his father: only he was sacrificing and burning incense upon the heights.
{3:4} And the king will go to the hill to sacrifice there; for it was the great height: a thousand burnt-offerings will Solomon bring up upon that altar.
{3:5} In the hill Jehovah was seen to Solomon in a dream at night: and God will say, Ask what I shall give to thee.
{3:6} And Solomon will say, Thou didst with thy servant David, my father, great mercy, according as he went before thee in the truth and in justice and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou wilt watch for him this great mercy, and thou wilt give to him a son sitting upon his throne as this day.
{3:7} And now, Jehovah my God, thou madest thy servant king instead of David my father and I a little boy, shall not know to go out and come in.
{3:8} And thy servant in the midst of thy people which thou didst choose, many people which shall not be numbered and counted for multitude.
{3:9} And give to thy servant a heart to hear to judge thy people to discern between good to evil: for who shall be able to judge this thy weighty people?
{3:10} And the word will be good in the eyes of God that Solomon asked this word.
{3:11} And God will say to him, Because thou didst ask this word, and didst not ask for thyself many days; and didst not ask for thyself riches, and didst not ask the soul of thine enemies: and didst ask for thyself to have understanding to hear judgment;
{3:12} Behold, I did according to thy word, I gave to thee a wise and understanding heart; that there was not as thou before thee, and after thee there shall not arise like thee.
{3:13} And also that thou askedst not I gave to thee, also riches, also honor, that there was not a man like thee among kings all thy days.
{3:14} And if thou wilt go in my way to watch my law and my commands, as David thy father went, I prolonged thy days.
{3:15} And Solomon will awake; and behold, a dream. And he will go to Jerusalem and stand before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and bring up burnt-offerings, and he will do peace, and make a drinking to all his servants.
{3:16} Then will come two women, harlots, to the king, and they will stand before him.
{3:17} And the one woman will say, With leave, my lord, I and this woman are dwelling in one house; and I shall bring forth with her in the house.
{3:18} And it will be in the third day after I brought forth, and also this woman will bring forth: and we together, and no stranger with us in the house besides we two in the house.
{3:19} And the son of this woman will die in the night when she lay upon him.
{3:20} And she will rise in the middle of the night and take my son from beside me, and thy servant sleeping; and she will lay him in her bosom and her dead son she laid in my bosom.
{3:21} And I shall rise in the morning to suckle my son, and behold, he was dead: and I shall attend to him in the morning, and behold, it was not my son that I brought forth.
{3:22} And the other woman will say, Nay; for my son the living, and thy son the dead. And this said, No; for thy son the dead, and my son the living. And they spake before the king.
{3:23} And the king will say, This says, My son the living, and thy son the dead; and this says, Nay; for thy son the dead, and my son the living.
{3:24} And the king will say, Take to me a sword. And they will bring the sword before the king.
{3:25} And the king will say, Divide the living child in two, and ye shall give the half to the one, and the half to the other.
{3:26} And the woman to whom the living son, will say to the king, for her bowels were warm upon her son, and she will say, With leave, my lord, ye shall give to her the living child, and slaying, ye shall not slay him. And this said, It shall not be even to me, even to thee; divide it.
{3:27} And the king will answer and say, Ye shall give to her the living child, and slaying, ye shall not slay it: she is his mother.
{3:28} And all Israel will hear the judgment which the king judged, and they will be afraid of the face of the king, for they saw that the wisdom of Jehovah was in the midst of him to do judgment.
{4:1} And Solomon will be reigning, king over all Israel.
{4:2} And these the chiefs which were to him: Azariah, son of Zadok the priest;
{4:3} Elihoreph and Ahiah, sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud, remembering.
{4:4} And Benaiah, son of Jehoida, over the army: and Zadok and Abiathar, priests:
{4:5} And Azariah son of Nathan, over the stations: and Zabud, son of Nathan the priest, the king's friend:
{4:6} And Ahishar over the house: and Adoniram son of Abda over the tribute.
{4:7} And to Solomon, twelve, set over all Israel, and they furnished the king and his house: a month in the year will be for one to furnish.
{4:8} And these their names: the son of Hur in mount Ephraim:
{4:9} The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and the House of the Sun, and the oak of the House of Mercy.
{4:10} The son of Hesed in Araboth; to him Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:
{4:11} The son of Abinadab, all the height of Dor: Taphath the daughter of Solomon was to him for wife.
{4:12} Baana son of Ahilud; Taanach and Megiddo, and all the House of Rest, which is by Zartanah from beneath Jezreel, from the House of Rest even to the Meadow of Dancing, even to the other side of Jokneam.
{4:13} The son of Geber in Ramoth-Gilead; to him Havoth-Jair son of Manasseh, which was in Gilead; to him a portion of Ergab which is in Bashan, sixty great cities, with a wall and bars of brass.
{4:14} Ahinadab, son of Iddo, the two camps.
{4:15} Ahimaaz in Naphtali; also he took Basmath daughter of Solomon for wife.
{4:16} Baana, son of Hushai in Asher and in Aloth:

{4:18} Shimei, son of Elah, in Benjamin.
{4:19} Geber, son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan; and one king set which was in the land.
{4:20} Judah and Israel many as the sand which is by the sea for multitude, eating and drinking and rejoicing.
{4:21} And Solomon was ruling over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the rovers, and even to the bound of Egypt: they were bringing a gift and serving Solomon all the days of his life.
{4:22} And the bread of Solomon for one day will be thirty cors of fine flour, and sixty cors of meal,
{4:23} Ten fatted oxen, and twenty oxen of the shepherd, and a hundred sheep, besides from the stag and the roe and the fallow deer, and fowls fattened.
{4:24} For he ruled over all beyond the river, from Tiphsah and even to Azzah, over all the kings beyond the river: and there was peace to him from all his servants from round about.
{4:25} And Judah dwelt, and Israel, with confidence, a man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan and even to the Well of the Oath, all the days of Solomon.
{4:26} And there will be to Solomon forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
{4:27} And these being set, furnished king Solomon, and all coming near king Solomon's table, each his month: a word will not be wanting.
{4:28} And the barley and the straw for horses, and for coursers, they will bring to the place where a man will be there according to his judgment.
{4:29} And God will give wisdom to Solomon, and understanding exceeding much, and breadth of heart as the sand which is upon the lip of the sea.
{4:30} And the wisdom of Solomon will be multiplied above the wisdom of all the sons of the east, and above all the wisdom of Egypt.
{4:31} And he will be wise above all men; above Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman and Chalcol and Darda, sons of Mahol: and his name will be in all the nations round about.
{4:32} And he will speak three thousand parables: and his songs will be five and a thousand.
{4:33} And he will speak concerning the woods, from the cedar which is in Lebanon, even to the hyssop which went forth on the wall: and he will speak upon the cattle, and upon the birds, and upon the creeping things, and upon the fishes.
{4:34} And there will come from all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who heard his wisdom.
{5:1} And Hiram king of Tyre will send his servants to Solomon for he heard that they anointed him for king instead of his father: for Hiram was loving to David all the days.
{5:2} And Solomon will send to Hiram, saying,
{5:3} Thou knewest David my father, that he was not able to build a house for the name of Jehovah his God from the face of wars which surrounded him, until Jehovah will give them under the soles of his feet.
{5:4} And now Jehovah my God caused rest to me from round about; not an adversary and not an evil event.
{5:5} And behold me saying to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, as Jehovah spake to David my father, saying, Thy son which I will give upon thy throne instead of thee, he shall build the house to my name.
{5:6} And now command and they shall cut for me cedars from Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and the hire of thy servants will I give to thee according to all which thou shalt say: for thou knewest that not among us a man knowing to cut wood as the Sidonians.
{5:7} And it will be when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, and he will rejoice greatly, and say, Blessed Jehovah this day who gave to David a wise son over this great people.
{5:8} And Hiram will send to Solomon, saying, I heard what thou sentest to me: I will do all thy pleasure in woods of cedars and in woods of cypress.
{5:9} My servants shall bring from Lebanon to the sea, and I will put them on rafts upon the sea, even to the place where thou wilt send to me; and I dispersed them there, and thou shalt lift up and thou shalt do my pleasure to give bread to my house.
{5:10} And Hiram will be giving to Solomon woods of cedar and woods of cypress, all his desire.
{5:11} And Solomon gave to Hiram twenty thousand cons of wheat food for his house, and twenty cors of beaten oil: thus Solomon will give to Hiram year by year.
{5:12} And Jehovah gave wisdom to Solomon, as he spake to him: and peace will be between Hiram and between Solomon; and they two will cut out a covenant.
{5:13} And king Solomon will bring up a tribute from all Israel; and the tribute will be thirty thousand men.
{5:14} And he will send them to Lebanon, ten thousand by the month; being changed, a month they shall be in Lebanon and two months in his house. And Adoniram over the tribute.
{5:15} And there will be to Solomon seventy thousand lifting up a burden, and eighty thousand hewing in the mountain.
{5:16} Besides from the chiefs set to Solomon which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred ruling over the people doing in the work.
{5:17} The king will command and they will remove great stones, precious stones; to set the house, cut stones.
{5:18} And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders, and those setting, will cut: and they will prepare the woods and stones to build the house.
{6:1} And it will be in the eightieth year and four hundredth year after the going out of the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, in the fourth year, in the month of brightness, it the second month to king Solomon over Israel, and he will build the house to Jehovah.
{6:2} And the house which king Solomon built to Jehovah, sixty cubits its length, and twenty its breadth, and thirty cubits its height.
{6:3} And the porch upon the face of the temple of the house, twenty cubits its length, upon the face of the breadth of the house; ten by the cubit its breadth upon the face of the house.
{6:4} And he will make for the house windows of closed bars.
{6:5} And he will build upon the wall of the house a floor round about the walls of the house round about for the temple, for the oracle: and he will make ribs round about.
{6:6} The floor the lower part, five by the cubit its breadth, and the middle, six by the cubit its breadth, and the third, seven by the cubit its breadth: for he gave offsets to the house round about without, so that it laid not hold upon the walls of the house.
{6:7} And the house in its building was built of stone completed from the quarry: and hammers and the axe, every instrument of iron was not heard in the house in its building.
{6:8} The door of the middle rib to the right shoulder of the house: and they will go up with windings upon the middle, and from the middle to the third.
{6:9} And he will build the house, and he will finish it; and cover the house with arches and rows with cedars.
{6:10} He will build the floor upon all the house, five cubits its height: and it will hold to the house with woods of cedars.
{6:11} And the word of Jehovah will be to Solomon, saying,
{6:12} This house which thou didst build, if thou shalt go in my laws, and my judgment thou wilt do, and watch all my commands to go in them; and I lifted up my word with thee which I spake to David thy father.
{6:13} And I dwelt in the midst of the sons of Israel, and I will not forsake my people Israel.
{6:14} And Solomon will build the house and finish it.
{6:15} And he will build the walls of the house from within it with ribs of cedars; from the bottom of the house even to the walls of the covering he overlaid with wood from within, and he will overlay the bottom of the house with ribs of cypresses.
{6:16} And he will build twenty cubits from the thighs of the house with ribs of cedars, from the bottom even to the walls: and he will build for it from within for the oracle to the holy of holies.
{6:17} And forty by the cubit was the house; it the temple before.
{6:18} And cedar to the house within carved work with ornaments and opening flower-buds; all cedar: no stone was seen.
{6:19} And the oracle in the midst of the house from within he prepared to give there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.
{6:20} And to the face of the oracle twenty cubits the length, and twenty cubits the breadth, and twenty cubits its height: and he will overlay it with gold shut up, and he will overlay the altar with cedar.
{6:21} And Solomon will overlay the house from the inside with gold shut up: and he will close up with chains of gold to the face of the oracle; and he will overlay it with gold.
{6:22} And all the house he overlaid with gold even till he completed all the house: and all the altar which was to the oracle he overlaid with gold.
{6:23} And he will make in the oracle two cherubims of woods of oil, ten cubits its height.
{6:24} And five cubits the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the second wing of the cherub: ten cubits from the extremities of its wings and even to the extremities of its wings.
{6:25} And ten by the cubit of the second cherub: one measure and one form to the two cherubs.
{6:26} The height of the one cherub ten by the cubit, and this to the second cherub.
{6:27} And he will give the cherubims in the midst of the house within: and the cherubims will expand the wings, and the wing of the one will touch upon the wall, and the wing of the second cherub touched upon the second wall; and their wings touched wing to wing to the middle of the house.
{6:28} And he will overlay the cherubims with gold.
{6:29} And all the walls of the house round about he carved with engravings of cherubims and palm trees and opening flower-buds from within and to without.
{6:30} And the bottom of the house he overlaid with gold from within and to without.
{6:31} And the openings of the oracle he made doors of the woods of oil: the projection of door-posts the fifth.
{6:32} And two doors of woods of oil; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims, and palm-trees, and opening flower-buds, and he overlaid with gold, and he brought down gold upon the cherubims and upon the palm-trees.
{6:33} And thus be made for the door of the temple, door-posts of woods of oil from the fourth.
{6:34} And two doors of the woods of cypresses: two ribs of the one door rolling, and two ribs of the second door rolling.
{6:35} And he carved cherubims and palm-trees, and opening flower-buds; and he overlaid with gold made even upon the carving.
{6:36} And he will build the enclosure of the insides three rows of cuttings, and a row of cuttings of cedars.
{6:37} In the fourth year was the house of Jehovah founded, in the month of brightness.
{6:38} And in the eleventh year in the month of rain (this the eighth month) was the house finished to all its words and according to all its judgment And he will build it seven years.
{7:1} And Solomon built his house thirteen years, and he will finish his house.
{7:2} And he will build the house of the forest of Lebanon; a hundred cubits its length, and fifty cubits its breadth, and and thirty cubits its height, upon four rows of pillars of cedars, and cuttings of cedars upon the pillars.
{7:3} And it was covered with cedar from above upon the ribs which were upon the forty and five pillars, fifteen to the row.
{7:4} And bars, three rows, and window against window, three steps.
{7:5} And all the doors and door-posts, quadrated with the bar: and the front of the window against the window, three steps.
{7:6} And he made a porch of pillars, fifty cubits its length, and thirty cubits its breadth: and the porch upon the face of them: and the pillars and the threshold upon the face of them.
{7:7} And a porch of the throne upon which he will judge there, a porch of judgment he made: and it was covered with cedar from the bottom even to the bottom.
{7:8} And his house where he dwelt there, another enclosure, from the house to the porch was according to this work And he will make a house for Pharaoh's daughter which Solomon took, according to this porch.
{7:9} All these precious stones according to the measures of cuttings, sawings with a saw, from within and from without, and from the foundation even to the expansions, and from without even to the great enclosure.
{7:10} And the foundation precious stones, great stones; stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits.
{7:11} And from above precious stones according to the measure of the cuttings and the cedars.
{7:12} And the great enclosure round about, three rows of cuttings, and a row of cuttings of cedars, and for the enclosure of the house of Jehovah within, and for the porch of the house.
{7:13} And king Solomon will send and take Hiram out of Tyre.
{7:14} Son of a widow woman from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father a Tyrian man, an artificer of brass; and he will be filled with wisdom and understanding, and knowledge to do all the work in brass. And he will come to king Solomon and do all his works.
{7:15} And he formed two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits the height of the one pillar: and a thread of twelve cubits will surround the two pillars.
{7:16} And he made two crowns upon the heads of the pillars, of molten brass: five cubits the height of the one crown, and five cubits the height of the second crown.
{7:17} Lattices of net work, festoons of chain work for the crown which was upon the head of the pillars; seven for the one crown and seven for the second crown.
{7:18} And he will make the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one net for covering the crowns which were upon	 the head, with pomegranates: and thus he made for the second crown.
{7:19} And the crowns which were upon the head of the, pillars of lily-work in the porch, four cubits.
{7:20} And the crowns upon the two pillars also from above from over against the belly which was beyond the net: the pomegranates two hundred in rows round about upon the second crown.
{7:21} And he will raise up the pillars for the porch of the temple: and he will raise up the right pillar and call its name Jachin: and he will raise up the left pillar and call its name Boaz.
{7:22} And upon the head of the pillars the work of the lily: and the work of the pillars will be completed.
{7:23} And he will make the sea molten, ten by the cubit, from its lip even to its lip, round, round about; and five by the cubit its height; and a rope thirty by the cubit will surround it round about.
{7:24} And ornaments from beneath to its lip round about surrounding it, ten by the cubit, folding round the sea round about: two rows of ornaments being cast in its casting.
{7:25} It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking to the north, and three looking to the sea, and three looking to the south, and three looking to the sunrising: and the sea upon them from above, and all their behinds inside:
{7:26} And its thickness a hand breadth, and its lip as the work of the lip of a cup the flower of the lily: it will hold two thousand baths.
{7:27} And he will make ten bases of brass, four by the cubit the length of the one base, and four by the cubit its breadth, and three by the cubit its height.
{7:28} And this the work of the base: borders to them, and borders between the joinings:
{7:29} And upon the borders which were between the joinings, lions, oxen, and cherubs: and upon the joinings thus from above: and from beneath to the lions and to the oxen, wreaths, a work of descent.
{7:30} And four wheels of brass to the one base, and axles of brass: and its four steps, shoulders to them: from under to the wash basin the shoulders molten from beyond each of the wreaths.
{7:31} And its mouth from within to the crown and from above, by the cubit: and the mouth, round; the work thus a cubit and half a cubit: and also upon the mouth engravings and their borders, quadrated, not round.
{7:32} And four wheels beneath to the borders; and hands of the wheels in the base: and the height of the one wheel a cubit and half of the cubit.
{7:33} And the work of the wheels as the work of a wheel of the chariot: their hands and their backs and their joinings and their gatherings all cast.
{7:34} And four shoulders to four corners of the one base: from the base its shoulder.
{7:35} And in the head of the base its height, half a cubit rounded round about: and upon the head of the base its hands and its borders from out of it.
{7:36} And he will open, upon the cheeks of its hands and upon its borders, cherubs, lions, and palm-trees, according to the nakedness of each, and wreaths round about.
{7:37} According to this he made the ten bases, one casting, one measure, one form to all of them.
{7:38} And he will make ten wash-basins of brass: the one wash-basin will hold forty baths, four by the cubit the one wash-basin, the one wash-basin upon the one base to the ten bases.
{7:39} And he will give five bases upon the shoulder of the house from the right, and five upon the shoulder of the house from its left: and he gave the sea from the shoulder of the house to the right to the east over against the south.
{7:40} And Hiram will make the washbasins and the shovels and the vases: and Hiram will finish doing all the work which he made for king Solomon in the house of Jehovah.
{7:41} The two pillars and the globes of the crowns which were upon the head of the two pillars and the two nets to cover the two globes of the crowns which were upon the head of the pillars;
{7:42} And four hundred pomegranates to the two nets, two rows of pomegranates to the one net, to cover the two globes of the crowns which were upon the face of the pillars;
{7:43} And the ten bases and the ten wash-basins upon the bases;
{7:44} And the one sea and the twelve oxen under the sea;
{7:45} And the pots and the shovels and the vases: and all these vessels which Hiram made for king Solomon of the house of Jehovah, of polished brass.
{7:46} In the circuit of Jordan the king cast them, in the density of the earth between Succoth and between Zarthan.
{7:47} And Solomon will leave all the vessels, an exceeding great multitude: and the weight of the brass was not searched out.
{7:48} And Solomon will make all the vessels which are for the house of Jehovah: the altar of gold, and the table which was upon it the bread of the face, of gold.
{7:49} And the chandeliers, five from the right, and five from the left, before the oracle, of gold shut up; and the flower, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold.
{7:50} And the thresholds, and the snuffers, and the vases, and the pans, and the fire-pans, of gold shut up; and the openings to the doors of the house within to the holy of holies, to the doors of the house to the temple, of gold.
{7:51} And all the work will be completed which king Solomon made for the house of Jehovah. And Solomon will bring in the holy things of David his father: the silver and the gold and the vessels he gave into the treasures of the house of Jehovah.
{8:1} Then Solomon will convoke together the old men of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, chiefs of the fathers to the sons of Israel, to king Solomon at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the city of David: this is Zion.
{8:2} And every man of Israel will be convoked to king Solomon in the month Ethanim in the festival: this the seventh month.
{8:3} And all the old men of Israel will come, and the priests will lift up the ark.
{8:4} And they will bring up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of appointment, and all the holy vessels which were in the tent, and the priests and the Levites will bring them up.
{8:5} And king Solomon and all the assembly of Israel assembled together to him, with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen which shall not be counted and shall not be numbered for multitude.
{8:6} And the priests will bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place to the oracle of the house to the holy of holies, to beneath the wings of the cherubims.
{8:7} For the cherubims spreading out their wings to the place of the ark, and the cherubims will cover over the ark and over the parts from above.
{8:8} And they will prolong the bars and the heads of the bars will be seen from the holies upon the face of the oracle, and they will not be seen without; and they will be there till this day.
{8:9} Nothing in the ark only the two tables of stones that Moses set down there in Horeb which Jehovah cut out with the sons of Israel in their coming out of the land of Egypt.
{8:10} And it will be in the priests coming out of the holy place, and the cloud filled the house of Jehovah.
{8:11} And the priests will not be able to stand to serve from the face of the cloud for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.
{8:12} Then said Solomon, Jehovah spake to dwell in thick clouds.
{8:13} Building, I built a house for thee to dwell, a place for thy resting forever.
{8:14} And thy king will turn his face round and bless all the convocation of Israel; and all the convocation of Israel stood;
{8:15} And he will say, Blessed Jehovah the God of Israel, who spake by his mouth to David my father, and by his hand filled up, saying,
{8:16} From the day which I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt I chose not a city from all the tribes of Israel to build a house for my name to be there; and I will choose upon David to be over my people Israel.
{8:17} And it will be with the heart of David my father to build a house for name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
{8:18} And Jehovah will say to David my father, Because it was with thy heart to build a house for my name, it was good it was with thy heart.
{8:19} But thou shalt not build a house, but thy son coming forth from thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
{8:20} And Jehovah will raise up his word which he spake; and I shall rise instead of David my father, and sit upon the throne of Israel, as Jehovah spake; and I will build the house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
{8:21} And I will set there a place for the ark, where is there the covenant of Jehovah which he cut out with our fathers in his bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
{8:22} And Solomon will stand at the face of the altar of Jehovah before all the convocation of Israel, and he will spread forth his hands to the heavens:
{8:23} And he will say, Jehovah the God of Israel, none like thee, the God in the heavens from above and upon the earth from beneath, watching the covenant and the mercy to thy servants going before thee with all their heart:
{8:24} Which thou didst watch to thy servant David my father what thou spakest to him: and thou wilt speak with thy mouth, and with thy hand thou didst complete as this day.
{8:25} And now Jehovah God of Israel watch to thy servant David my father what thou spakest to him, saying, There shall not be cut off to thee a man from my face sitting upon the throne of Israel; only if thy sons shall watch their way to go before me as thou didst go before me.
{8:26} And now, O God of Israel, thy word now shall be firm which thou spakest to thy servant David my father.
{8:27} For truly shall God dwell upon the earth? Behold the heavens and the heavens of the heavens shall not contain thee; much less this house which I built.
{8:28} And look to the supplication of thy servant, and to his prayer, O Jehovah my God, to hear to the cry and to the supplication which thy servant prays before thee this day:
{8:29} For thine eye to be opened to this house night and day, to the place of which thou saidst, My name shall be there; to hear to the supplication which thy servant shall pray to this place.
{8:30} And wilt thou hear to the prayer of thy servant and of thy people Israel which they shall pray to this place? and wilt thou hear to the place of thy dwelling to the heavens? and hear and forgive?
{8:31} Whatever man shall sin against his neighbor, and an oath lifted up upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house,
{8:32} And thou wilt hear in the heavens, and do, and judge thy servants to condemn the unjust, to give his way upon his head, and to acquit the just, to give to him according to his justice.
{8:33} In thy people Israel being struck before the enemy because they will sin against thee, and they turned back to thee, and they confessed thy name and prayed, and made supplication to thee in this house.
{8:34} And wilt thou hear in the heavens and forgive to the sin of thy people Israel, and turn them back to the land which thou gavest to their fathers?
{8:35} In the heavens being shut up and there will be no rain when they shall sin against thee; and they pray to this place and profess thy name, and they turn back from their sin when thou shalt humble them:
{8:36} And wilt thou hear in the heavens and forgive to the sin of thy servants and of thy people Israel? for thou wilt teach them the good way which they shall go in it, and give rain upon thy land which thou gavest to thy people for an inheritance.
{8:37} If famine shall be in the land, if there shall be death, blasting, yellowness, the locust devouring; if his enemy shall press upon him in the land of his gates, every blow, every sickness;
{8:38} Every prayer, every supplication which shall be to every man to all thy people Israel which shall know a man the blow to his heart and spread forth his hands to this house:
{8:39} Wilt thou hear in the heavens thy prepared dwelling, and forgive and do, and give to a man according to all his ways? for thou wilt know his heart; for thou wilt know alone the heart of all the sons of men:
{8:40} So that they will fear thee all the days which they live upon the face of the earth which thou gavest to our fathers.
{8:41} And also for the strangers which are not of thy people Israel, he shall come from a land afar off for sake of thy name;
{8:42} (For they will hear of thy great name and thy strong hand, and thy stretched out arm;) and coming and praying to this house;
{8:43} Wilt thou hear in the heavens thy prepared dwelling, and do according to all the stranger shall call upon thee? so that all the people of the earth shall know thy name to fear thee as thy people Israel; and to know that thy name was called upon this house which I built.
{8:44} If thy people shall go forth to war against his enemy in the way which thou shalt send them, and pray to Jehovah the way of the city which thou didst choose in it, and the house which I built for thy name:
{8:45} And hear thou in the heavens their supplication and their prayer, and do their judgment.
{8:46} For they will sin against thee (for no man which will not sin) and thou wert angry with them and gave them before the enemy, and they carried them away their captives to the land of the enemy, far off or near;
{8:47} And they turned back to their heart in the land which they were carried captive there, and they turned back and supplicated to thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We sinned and acted perversely, and did evil;
{8:48} And they turned back to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who carried them captive, and prayed to thee the way of their land which thou gavest to their fathers, the city which thou didst choose, and the house which I built to thy name:
{8:49} And hear in the heavens thy prepared dwelling, their supplication and their prayer, and do their judgment,
{8:50} And forgive to thy people who sinned against thee, and all their transgressions which they transgressed against thee, and give them for compassion before those carrying them captive, and they compassionated them:
{8:51} For they thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron:
{8:52} For thine eyes to be opened to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy people Israel, to hear to them in all their calling to thee.
{8:53} For thou didst separate them to thyself for an inheritance from all the people of the earth as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, in thy bringing our fathers out of the land of Egypt, O Lord Jehovah.
{8:54} And it will be as Solomon finished praying to Jehovah all this supplication and prayer, he rose from the face of the altar of Jehovah, from bending upon his knees and his hands spread forth to the heavens.
{8:55} And he will stand and bless all the convocation of Israel with a great voice, saying,
{8:56} Blessed Jehovah who gave rest to his people Israel, according to all which he spake: there fell not one word from all his good word which he spake by the hand of Moses his servant.
{8:57} Jehovah our God will be with us as he was with our fathers: he will not forsake us, and he will not cast us off.
{8:58} To incline our heart to him, to go in all his ways, and to watch his commands and his laws and his judgments which he commanded our fathers.
{8:59} And these words which I supplicated before Jehovah shall be drawing near to Jehovah our God day and night, to do the judgment of his servant and the judgment of his people Israel, the word of a day in its day.
{8:60} For all the people of the earth to know that Jehovah he is God, none besides.
{8:61} And your hearts be perfect with Jehovah our God to go in his laws, and to watch his commands as this day.
{8:62} And the king and all Israel with him sacrificed a sacrifice before Jehovah.
{8:63} And Solomon will sacrifice a sacrifice of peace which he sacrificed to Jehovah, twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. And the king and all the sons of Israel will consecrate the house of Jehovah.
{8:64} In that day the king consecrated the middle of the enclosure which was before the house of Jehovah: for he did there the burnt-offering and the gifts and the fat of the peace: for the altar of brass which was before Jehovah was little for containing the burnt-offering and the gifts and the fat of the peace.
{8:65} And Solomon will make the festival in that day, and all Israel with him, a great convocation from the going in of Hamath even to the torrent of Egypt, before Jehovah our God seven days and seven days, fourteen days.
{8:66} In the eighth day he sent away the people, and they will bless the king and go to their tents rejoicing and good of heart for all the good which Jehovah did for David his servant and for Israel his people.
{9:1} And it will be when Solomon finished building the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king, and all the pleasure of Solomon which he desired to do,
{9:2} And Jehovah will be seen to Solomon the second time as he was seen to him in the hill.
{9:3} And Jehovah will say to him, I heard thy supplication and thy prayer which thou didst supplicate before me: I consecrated this house which thou didst build to put my name there even to forever; and mine eyes and my heart were there all the days.
{9:4} And thou, if thou shalt go before me as David thy father went with integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that I commanded thee, my law and my judgment thou shalt watch:
{9:5} And I raised up the throne of thy kingdom over Israel forever, as spake to David thy father, saying, There shall not be cut off to thee a man from the throne of Israel.
{9:6} If turning back, ye shall turn back, ye and your sons from after me, and shall not watch my commands, my laws which I gave before you, and ye went and served other gods and worshiped to them:
{9:7} And I cut off Israel from the face of the earth which I gave to them and the house which I consecrated to my name I will cast out from my face; and Israel was for a parable and for a derision among all peoples.
{9:8} And this house shall be high, every one passing by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss: and they said, For what did Jehovah thus to this land and to this house?
{9:9} And they said, Because they forsook Jehovah their God who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and they will lay hold upon other gods and worship to them, and serve them: for this, Jehovah brought, upon them all this evil.
{9:10} And it will be from the end of twenty years, when Solomon built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the house of the king,
{9:11} (Hiram, king of Tyre, aided Solomon in woods of cedars and in woods of cypresses, and in gold to all his desire) then king Solomon will give Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
{9:12} And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon gave to him, and they were not right in his eyes.
{9:13} And he will say, What these cities which thou gavest to me, my brother? And he will call them the land Cabul even to this day.
{9:14} And Hiram will send to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold.
{9:15} And this the word of tribute which king Solomon brought up to build the house of Jehovah, and his house, and the fortress, and the walls of Jerusalem, and the enclosure, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
{9:16} Pharaoh king of Egypt came up, and he will take Gezer and burn it in fire, and he killed the Canaanite dwelling in the city, and he will give it a sending to his daughter, Solomon's.
{9:17} And Solomon will build Gezer, and the house of the hollow below,
{9:18} And Baalath and Tadmor in the desert, in the land.
{9:19} And all the cities of stores which were to Solomon, and the cities of chariots, and the cities of horsemen, and the pleasure of Solomon which he pleased to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon; and in all the land of his ruling.
{9:20} All the people remaining of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, which were not of the sons of Israel;
{9:21} Their sons which were left after them in the land, which the sons of Israel will not be able to destroy them, and Solomon will bring them up for tribute of work even to this day.
{9:22} And of the sons of Israel, Solomon gave not to serve, for they were men of war, and his servants and his chiefs, and his warriors, and chiefs of chariots, and his horsemen.
{9:23} These the chiefs being stationed which were over the work to Solomon, fifty and five hundred going down among the people working in the work.
{9:24} But Pharaoh's daughter went up from the city of David to her house which he built for her: then he built the fortress.
{9:25} And Solomon brought up three times in a year burnt-offerings and peace upon the altar which he built to Jehovah, and he burnt incense upon it that was before Jehovah: and he completed the house.
{9:26} And Solomon made a ship in Ezion-Geber, which is with Eloth, upon the lip of the sea of sedge in the land of Edom.
{9:27} And Hiram will send in the ships his servants, men of ships, knowing the sea with Solomon's servants.
{9:28} And they will come to Ophir, and take gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and bring to king Solomon.
{10:1} And queen Sheba heard the report of Solomon for the name of Jehovah, and she will come to try him in enigmas.
{10:2} And she will come to Jerusalem with very weighty strength, camels lifting up spices, and exceeding much gold and precious stone: and she will come to Solomon and will speak to him all which was in her heart.
{10:3} And Solomon will announce to her all her words: there was not a word hid from the king which he announced not to her.
{10:4} And queen Sheba will see all Solomon's wisdom, and the house which he built,
{10:5} And the food of his table, and the seats of his servants, and the standing of his attendants, and their vestments, and his cup-bearers, and his burnt-offerings which he will bring up to the house of Jehovah; and no more spirit was in her.
{10:6} And she will say to the king, The word was truth which I heard in my land concerning thy words, and concerning thy wisdom.
{10:7} And I believed not the words until I came, and mine eyes will see it: and behold, the half was not announced to me: thou didst add wisdom and good to the report which I heard.
{10:8} Happy thy men, happy these thy servants, standing before thee continually, hearing thy wisdom.
{10:9} Jehovah thy God will be blessed, who delighted in thee to give thee upon the throne of Israel: in Jehovah's loving Israel forever, and he will set thee up for king to do judgment and justice.
{10:10} And she will give to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices very many, and precious stone; there came no more as this spice for multitude which queen Sheba gave to king Solomon.
{10:11} And also the ship of Hiram which lifted up gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir woods of almugs very many, and precious stone.
{10:12} And the king will make of the almug trees a support for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, harps and lyres for songs; there came not such woods of almugs, and were not seen even to this day.
{10:13} And king Solomon gave to queen Sheba all her desire which she asked, besides what he gave to her according to the hand of king Solomon. And she will turn and go to her land, she and her servants.
{10:14} And the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year will be six hundred sixty and six talents of gold,
{10:15} Besides from the men traveling about and from the traffic of the merchants, and all the kings of Arabia and all the prefects of the earth.
{10:16} And king Solomon will make two hundred shields of beaten gold; six hundred of gold will come up upon the one shield.
{10:17} And three hundred shields of beaten gold; three parts of gold will come up upon the one shield: and the king will give them to the house of the forest of Lebanon.
{10:18} And the king will make a great ivory throne, and overlaid it with pure gold.
{10:19} Six steps to the throne, and the head rounded to the throne from its back parts: and hands hence and thence upon the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the hands.
{10:20} And twelve lions standing there upon the six steps, hence and thence: there was not made thus to all the kingdoms.
{10:21} And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon, gold, and every vessel of the house of the forest of Lebanon, gold shut up; nothing silver: it was not reckoned in the days of Solomon for any thin
{10:22} For a ship of Tharshish to the king in the sea with the ship of Hiram: one for three years will come, a ship of Tharshish lifting up gold and silver and ivory and apes and peacocks.
{10:23} And king Solomon will be magnified above all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
{10:24} And all the earth are seeking the face of Solomon to hear his wisdom which God gave in his heart.
{10:25} And they were bringing each his gifts, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and garments and weapons and spices, horses, and mules, the word of a year in a year.
{10:26} And Solomon will gather together chariots and horsemen: and there will be to him a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he will set them down in the cities of chariots and with the king in Jerusalem.
{10:27} And the king will give silver in Jerusalem, as stones, and cedars he gave as sycamores which are in the plain for multitude.
{10:28} And a going forth of horses out of Egypt to Solomon, and a caravan of the king's merchants will take the caravan at a price.
{10:29} And a chariot will go up and come forth out of Egypt with six hundred of silver, and a horse at fifty and a hundred: and thus for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Aram, by their hand they will bring forth.
{11:1} And king Solomon loved many strange women, and the daughter of Pharaoh, Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, Hittites;
{11:2} From the nations which Jehovah said to the sons of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, and they shall not come in to you: surely they will turn your heart after their gods: to these Solomon joined to love.
{11:3} And there will be to him seven hundred chief wives, and three hundred concubines: and his wives will turn his heart.
{11:4} And it will be at the time of the old age of Solomon his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God as the heart of David his father.
{11:5} And Solomon will go after Ashtaroth the god of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
{11:6} And Solomon will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and he will not fill up after Jehovah as David his father.
{11:7} Then Solomon will build a height for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the mountain which is upon the face of Jerusalem, and for the king, the abomination of the sons of Ammon.
{11:8} And thus he did for all his strange wives, they burning incense and sacrificing to their gods.
{11:9} And Jehovah will be angry with Solomon, for his heart was turned from Jehovah the God of Israel, being seen to him twice.
{11:10} And he commanded him concerning this word not to go after other gods: and he watched not what Jehovah commanded.
{11:11} And Jehovah will say to Solomon, Because this was with thee, and thou didst not watch my covenant and my laws which I commanded upon thee, rending, I will rend the kingdom from thee and give it to thy servant.
{11:12} But in thy days I will not do it for sake of David thy father; out of the hand of thy son will I rend it.
{11:13} But I will not rend all the kingdom; one tribe I will give to thy son for sake of David my servant, and for sake of Jerusalem which I chose.
{11:14} And Jehovah will raise up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he from the king's seed in Edom.
{11:15} And it will be in David's being in Edom, and in Joab the chief of the army going up, he came to bury the slain, and he will strike every male in Edom;
{11:16} (For six months Joab dwelt there and all Israel, till he cut off every male in Edom.)
{11:17} And Hadad will flee, he and the men, Edomites, his father's servants, with him to go to Egypt; and Hadad a small boy.
{11:18} And they will rise from Midian and come to Paran: and they will take men with them from Paran, and they will go to Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he will give to him a house and spake bread for him, and gave to him land.
{11:19} And Hadad will find favor in the eyes of Pharaoh greatly, and he will give to him a wife, sister of his wife, sister of Tahpenes the mistress.
{11:20} And the sister of Tahpenes will bare to him Genubath his son, and Tahpenes will wean him in the midst of Pharaoh's house: and Genubath will be in Pharaoh's house in the midst of Pharaoh's sons.
{11:21} And Hadad heard in Egypt that David lay down with his fathers, and that Joab chief of the army died, and Hadad will say to Pharaoh, Send me away, and I will go to my land.
{11:22} And Pharaoh will say to him, For what lackest thou with me, and behold thee seeking to go to thy land? and he will say, Naught: but sending, thou shalt send me away.
{11:23} And God will raise up to him an adversary, Rezon, son of Eliadah, who lied from Hadadezer king of Zobah his lord.
{11:24} And he will gather to himself men, and he will be chief of a troop in David's killing them; and they will go to Damascus and dwell in it and reign in Damascus.
{11:25} And he will be an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, and the evil which Hadad did: and he will abhor against Israel and he will reign over Aram.
{11:26} And Jeroboam son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, and his mother's name Zeruah, a widow woman, servant to Solomon, and he will lift up the hand against the king.
{11:27} And this the word for which he lifted up the hand against the king: Solomon built the fortress and shut up the breaches of the city of David his father.
{11:28} And the man Jeroboam mighty of strength: and Solomon will see the boy that he did work, and he will appoint him for the burden of the house of Joseph.
{11:29} And it will be in that time, and Jeroboam went forth from Jerusalem, and Ahijah the Shilonite will find him going in the way; and he being covered with a new garment; and they two alone in the field.
{11:30} And Ahijah will lay hold upon the new garment which was upon him and will rend it in twelve rents:
{11:31} And he will say to Jeroboam, Take to thee ten rents: for thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Behold me rending the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and I gave to thee ten tribes:
{11:32} (And the one tribe shall be to him, for sake of my servant David, and for sake of Jerusalem the city which I chose in it from all the tribes of Israel:)
{11:33} Because they forsook me and worshiped to Ashtaroth the god of Zidon, and to Chemosh, god of Moab, and to Milcom, god of the sons of Ammon, and they went not in my way to do the straight in mine eyes, and my laws and my judgments as David his father.
{11:34} And I will not take all the kingdom from his hand, for I will set him chief all the days of his life for sake of David my servant whom I chose him, because he watched my commands and my laws.
{11:35} And I took the kingdom from the hand of his son and gave it to thee, the ten tribes.
{11:36} And to his son I will give one tribe on account of there being a light to David my servant all the days before me in Jerusalem the city which I chose to me to put my name there.
{11:37} And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all which thy soul shall desire, and be king over Israel.
{11:38} And being if thou shalt hear all that I shall command thee, and go in my way and do the straight in mine eyes to watch my laws and my commands as David my servant did, and I was with thee and built to thee a faithful house as I built to David, and I gave Israel to thee.
{11:39} And I will humble the seed of David for this, but not all the days.
{11:40} And Solomon will seek to kill Jeroboam, and Jeroboam will rise and flee to Egypt to Shishak, king of Egypt, and he will be in Egypt till the death of Solomon.
{11:41} And the remainder of the words of Solomon and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written upon the book of the words of Solomon?
{11:42} And the days which Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel were forty years.
{11:43} And Solomon will lie down with his fathers and be buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son will reign instead of him.
{12:1} And Rehoboam will go to Shechem, for to Shechem came all Israel to make him king.
{12:2} And it will be when Jeroboam son of Nebat heard and he yet in Egypt where he fled from the face of Solomon the king, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;
{12:3} And they will send and call for him: and Jeroboam and all the convocation of Israel will come and speak to Rehoboam, saying,
{12:4} Thy father made our yoke hard and now do thou lighten from the hard service of thy father, and from the heavy yoke which he gave upon us, and we will serve thee.
{12:5} And he will say to them, Go ye, until three days, and turn back to me. And the people will go.
{12:6} And king Rehoboam will consult the old men which were standing before Solomon his father in his being alive saying, How advise ye to turn back this people word?
{12:7} And they will speak to him, saying, If this day thou wilt be a servant to this people and serve them, and answer them, and speak to them good words, and they were servants to thee all the days.
{12:8} And he will forsake the counsel of the old men which they counseled him, and he will consult with the children which grew up with him which were standing before him.
{12:9} And he will say to them, What do ye advise? and we will turn back word to this people who spake to me, saying, Lighten from the yoke which thy father gave upon us.
{12:10} And the children which grew up with him will speak to him, saying, Thus shalt thou say to this people who spake to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, do thou lighten from upon us; thus shalt thou speak to them, My littleness thick above my father's loins.
{12:11} And now my father loaded upon you a heavy yoke, and I will add upon your yoke: my father chastised you with whips and I will chastise you with scorpions.
{12:12} And Jeroboam and all the people will come to Rehoboam in the third day, as the king spake, saying, Turn back to me in the third day.
{12:13} And the king will answer the people hard, and he will forsake the counsel of the old men which they counseled him;
{12:14} And he will speak to them according to the counsel of the children, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add upon your yoke: my father chastised you with whips and I will chastise you with scorpions.
{12:15} And the king heard not to the people, for the turn was from Jehovah for sake of lifting up his word which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
{12:16} And all Israel will see that the king heard not to them, and the people will turn back the king word, saying, What part to us in David? and no inheritance in the son of Jesse: to thy tents, O Israel: now see to thy house, David. And Israel will go to their tents.
{12:17} And the sons of Israel dwelling in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam will reign over them.
{12:18} And king Rehoboam will send Adoram who was over the tribute, and all Israel will stone upon him with stone, and he will die. And king Rehoboam strengthened himself to go up into the chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
{12:19} And Israel will break with the house of David even to this day.
{12:20} And it will be when all Israel heard that Jeroboam turned back, and they will send and call him to the assembly, and they will make him king over all Israel, and there was none after the house of David except the tribe of Judah alone.
{12:21} And Rehoboam will come to Jerusalem, and he will convoke together all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen to make war to fight with the house of Israel to turn back the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon.
{12:22} And the word of God will be to Shemaiah, a man of God, saying,
{12:23} Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and the remainder of the people, saying,
{12:24} Thus said Jehovah, Ye shall not go up and ye shall not fight with your brethren, sons of Israel: turn back each to his house, for this word was from me. And they will hear the word of Jehovah and turn back to go according to the word of Jehovah.
{12:25} And Jeroboam will build Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwell in it; and he will go forth from there and build Penuel.
{12:26} And Jeroboam will say in his heart, Now will the kingdom turn back to the house of David.
{12:27} If this people shall go up to do sacrifices in the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, and the heart of this people turned back to their lord, to Rehoboam king of Judah, and killing me, and they turned back to Rehoboam king of Judah.
{12:28} And the king will consult and make two calves of gold, and he will say to them, Much for you going up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
{12:29} And he will set up the one in the house of God, and the one he gave in Dan.
{12:30} And this word will be for sin: and the people will go before the one, even to Dan.
{12:31} And he will make a house of heights, and be will make priests from the ends of the people who were not of the sons of Levi.
{12:32} And Jeroboam will make a festival in the eighth month, in the fifteenth day of the month, according to the festival that is in Judah, and he will go up upon the altar. Thus he did in the house of God to sacrifice to the calves which he made: and he placed in the house of God priests of the heights which he made.
{12:33} And he brought up upon the altar which he made m the house of God, in the fifteenth day, in the eighth month, in the month which he devised of himself; and he will make a festival to the sons of Israel: and he will go up upon the altar to burn incense.
{13:1} And behold a man of God came out of Judah in the word of Jehovah to the house of God; and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
{13:2} And be will call upon the altar in the word of Jehovah, and he will say, O altar, altar! thus said Jehovah, Behold, a son was born to the house of David, Josiah his name; and he sacrificed upon thee, the priests of the heights burning incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.
{13:3} And, he will give in that day a sign, saying, This the sign which Jehovah spake: Behold, the altar rent and the fat which was upon it, poured out.
{13:4} And it will be when the king heard the word of the man of God which he called upon the altar in the house of God; and Jeroboam will stretch forth his hand from above the altar, saving, Seize him. And his hand which he stretched forth upon him will be dried up, and he will not be able to turn it back to him.
{13:5} And the altar was rent, and the fat will be poured out from the altar according to the sign that the man of God gave by the word of Jehovah.
{13:6} And the king will answer and say to the man of God, Supplicate the face of Jehovah thy God, and pray for me, and my hand shall be turned back to me And the man of God will supplicate the face of Jehovah, and the king's hand will turn back to him and be as in the beginning.
{13:7} And the king will speak to the man of God, Come with me to the house, and be strengthened, and I will give to thee a gift.
{13:8} And the man of God will say to the king, If thou wilt give to me half thy house I will not go with thee, and I will not eat bread and I will not drink water in this place:
{13:9} For thus it was commanded me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Thou shalt not eat bread, and thou shalt not drink water, and thou shalt not turn back in the way which thou camest.
{13:10} And he will go in another way, and he turned not back in the way which he came in it to the house of God.
{13:11} And one prophet, an old man, dwelt in the house of God; and his sons will come and relate to him all the work which the man of God did that day in the house of God: the words which he spake to the king, and they will relate them to their father.
{13:12} And their father will speak to them, What way went he? and his sons will see the way that the man of God went who came from Judah.
{13:13} And he will say to his sons, Saddle for me the ass: and they will saddle for him the ass and he will ride upon it.
{13:14} And he will go after the man of God, and he will find him sitting under an oak: and he will say to him, Thou the man of God who came from Judah? And he will say, I.
{13:15} And he will say to him, Go with me to the house and eat bread.
{13:16} And he will say, I shall not be able to turn back with thee and to go with thee: and I will not eat bread and I will not drink water with thee in this place:
{13:17} For it was spoken to me by the word of Jehovah, Thou shalt not eat bread and thou shalt not drink water there, thou shalt not turn back to go in the way which thou wentest in it.
{13:18} And he will say to him, I also a prophet as thou; and a messenger spake to me in the word of Jehovah, saying, Turn him back with thee to thy house; and he shall eat bread and drink water. Lying to him.
{13:19} And he will turn back with him and eat bread in his house, and drink water.
{13:20} And it will be, they sitting at the table, and the word of Jehovah will be to the prophet who turned him back:
{13:21} And he will call to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Because thou didst imbitter the mouth of Jehovah and didst not watch the command, which Jehovah thy God commanded thee,
{13:22} And thou wilt turn back and eat bread and drink water in the place which he spake to thee, Thou shalt not eat bread and thou shalt not drink water; thy corpse shall not come to the grave of thy fathers.
{13:23} And it will be after his eating bread and after his drinking, and he will saddle for him the ass for the prophet which he turned back.
{13:24} And he will go, and a lion will find him in the way and kill him: and his corpse will be cast in the way, and the ass standing by it, and the lion standing by the corpse.
{13:25} And behold, men passing by, and they will see the corpse cast in the way, and the lion standing by the corpse: and they will come and speak in he city where the prophet, the old man, dwelt in it.
{13:26} And the prophet that brought him back from the way will hear, and say, It is the man of God who resisted the mouth of Jehovah, and Jehovah will give him to the lion, and he will break him, and he will kill him according to the word of Jehovah which he spake to him.
{13:27} And he will speak to his sons, saying, Saddle for me the ass. And they will saddle him.
{13:28} And he will go and find his corpse cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the corpse: the lion ate not the carcass and brake not the ass.
{13:29} And the prophet will lift up the corpse of the man of God and place it upon the ass, and he will turn him back: and the prophet, the old man, came to the city, and he will mourn and he will bury him.
{13:30} And he will lay it down in his grave, and they will mourn over him, Alas, my brother!
{13:31} And it will be after they buried him, he will say to his sons, saying, In my dying and ye shall bury me in the grave which the man of God was buried in it; by his bones place my bones.
{13:32} For being, the word shall be which he cried by the word of Jehovah upon the altar which is in the house of God, and upon all the houses of the heights which are in the cities of Shomeron.
{13:33} After this word Jeroboam turned not back from his evil way, and he will turn back and make from the ends of the people, priests of the heights: him desiring he will fill his hand, and he will be priest of the heights.
{13:34} And in this word it will be for sin to the house of Jeroboam, and to cut off and to destroy from the face of the earth.
{14:1} In that time Abijah son of Jeroboam was sick.
{14:2} And Jeroboam will say to his wife, Arise, now, and change thyself, and they will not know that thou art the wife of Jeroboam; and go to Shiloh: behold there Ahijah the prophet; he spake concerning me for king over this people.
{14:3} And take in thy hand ten of bread and crumb cakes, and a bottle of honey, and go to him: he will announce to thee what will be to the boy.
{14:4} And Jeroboam's wife will do so, and she will rise and go to Shiloh, and she will come into the house of Ahijah. And Ahijah will not be able to see; for his eyes stood from his old age.
{14:5} And Jehovah said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam coming to seek word from thee for her son, for he was sick: according this and according to this shalt thou speak to her: and it will be as she comes, and she dissembles.
{14:6} And it will be when Ahijah heard the voice of her feet coming into the door, and he will say, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; wherefore this thou dissemblest? and I send to thee hard things.
{14:7} Go say to Jeroboam, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Because I raised thee up from the midst of the people, and I will give thee chief over my people Israel,
{14:8} And I will rend the kingdom from the house of David, and I will give it to thee: and thou wert not as my servant David who watched my commands and who went after me with all his heart to do only the straight in mine eyes;
{14:9} And thou wilt be evil doing above all who were before thee: and thou wilt go and make to thee other gods, and molten things to irritate me, and didst cast me behind thy back.
{14:10} For this, behold me bringing evil to the house of Jeroboam, and I cut off to Jeroboam him pissing against the wall, the shut up and the forsaken in Israel, and I took away after the house of Jeroboam as dung shall be taken away till its finishing.
{14:11} Him dying to Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him dying in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat: for Jehovah spake.
{14:12} And arise, thou, go to thy house: in the coming of thy feet to the city and the child died.
{14:13} And all Israel mourned for him, and they buried him: for this alone to Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because there was found in him a good word to Jehovah God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
{14:14} And Jehovah raised up to him a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: and what? also now.
{14:15} And Jehovah smote Israel as a reed will be shaken in the water, and he plucked up Israel from this good land which he gave to their fathers, and he scattered them from beyond the river, because they made their images, irritating Jehovah.
{14:16} And he will give up Israel on account of the sins of Jeroboam who sinned, and who caused Israel to sin.
{14:17} And Jeroboam's wife will arise and go, and come to Tirzah: she came upon the threshold of the house, and the boy died.
{14:18} And they will bury him; and all Israel will mourn for him according to the word of Jehovah which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.
{14:19} And the remainder of the words of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold them written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Israel.
{14:20} And the days which Jeroboam reigned, twenty and two years, and he will lie down with his fathers; and Nadab his son will reign in his stead.
{14:21} And Rehoboam son of Solomon reigned in Judah. The son of forty and one years was Rehoboam in his reigning; and seventeen years he reigned in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah chose to put his name there from all the tribes of Israel: and the name of his mother Naamah, the Ammonitess.
{14:22} And Judah will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and they will provoke him to jealousy above all which their fathers did in the sins which they sinned.
{14:23} And they will also build to them heights and statues, and pillars, upon every high hill, and, under every green tree.
{14:24} And also there was a holy place in the land; and they did according to all the abominations of the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from the face of the sons of Israel.
{14:25} And it will be in the fifth year to king Rehoboam, Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem.
{14:26} And he will take the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king's house; and he took all: and he took all the shields of gold which Solomon made.
{14:27} And king Rehoboam will make in their stead shields of brass, and appointed upon the hand of the chief of the runners watching the door of the house of the king.
{14:28} And it will be whenever the king went to the house of Jehovah, the runners will lift them up and they turned them back to the runner's chamber.
{14:29} And the remainder of the words of Rehoboam, and all which he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?
{14:30} And war was between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days.
{14:31} And Rehoboam will lie down with his fathers and be buried with his fathers in the city of David. And the name of his mother, Naamah, the Ammonitess. And Abijam will reign in his stead.
{15:1} And in the eighteenth year to Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijam reigned over Judah.
{15:2} Three years he reigned in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother Maachah, daughter of Abishalom.
{15:3} And he went in all the sins of his father which he did before him: and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah as the heart of David his father.
{15:4} For on account of David, Jehovah his God gave to him a light in Jerusalem, to raise up a son after him, to cause Jerusalem to stand:
{15:5} Because David did the right in the eyes of Jehovah, and turned not aside from all which he commanded all the days of his life, only in the word of Uriah the Hittite.
{15:6} And war was between Rehoboam and between Jeroboam all the days of his life.
{15:7} And the remainder of the words of Abijam, and all which he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah? and war was between Abijam and Jeroboam.
{15:8} And Abijam will lie down with his fathers; and they will bury him in the city of David; and Asa his son will reign in his stead.
{15:9} And in the twentieth year to Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa reigned over Judah.
{15:10} Forty and one years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Maachah, daughter of Abishalom.
{15:11} And Asa will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah, as David his father.
{15:12} And he will take away the holy places from the land, and he will turn aside all the blocks which his fathers made.
{15:13} And also Maachah, his mother, he will turn aside from being mistress, because she made terror to a statue; and Asa will cut off her terror, and burn by the torrent Kidron.
{15:14} And the heights were not turned aside: but Asa's heart was perfect with Jehovah all his days.
{15:15} And he will bring in the holy things of his fathers, and his holy things to the house of Jehovah, silver and gold and vessels.
{15:16} And war was between Asa and between Baasha, king of Israel, all their days.
{15:17} And Baasha, king of Israel, will come up against Judah, and he will build Ramah, so that he will not give to go out or to come in to Asa king of Judah.
{15:18} And Asa will take all the silver and the gold being left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house, and he will give them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa will send them to the son of Hadad, son of Tabrimon, son of Hezion, king of Aram, dwelling in Damascus, saying,
{15:19} A covenant between me and between thee, between my father and between thy father: behold, I sent to thee a gift of silver and gold; go break thy covenant with Baasha king of Israel, and he will go up from me.
{15:20} And the son of Hadad will hear to king Asa, and he will send the chiefs of the forces which were to him against the cities of Israel, and he will strike Ijon and Dan, and the meadow of the House of Oppression, and all Cinneroth with all the land of Naphtali.
{15:21} And it will be when Baasha heard, and he will leave off building Ramah, and he will dwell in Tirzah.
{15:22} And king Asa caused all Judah to hear; none free: and they will lift up the stones of Ramah and its woods which Baasha built, and king Asa will build with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpeh.
{15:23} And the remainder of all the words of Asa and all his power and all which he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah? only at the time of his old age, he hurt his feet.
{15:24} And Asa will lie down with his fathers, and be buried with his fathers, in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son will reign in his stead.
{15:25} And Nadab son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in the second year to Asa king of Judah; and he will reign over Israel two years.
{15:26} And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and he will go in the way of his father, and in his sins which he caused Israel to sin.
{15:27} And Baasha son of Ahijah, to the house of Issachar, will conspire against him; and Baasha will strike him in Gibbethon, which is to the rovers; for Nadab and all Israel pressed upon Gibbethon.
{15:28} And Baasha will kill him in the third year to Asa king of Judah, and he will reign in his stead.
{15:29} And it will be when he reigned, he struck all the house of Jeroboam; he left not any breathing to Jeroboam, till he destroyed him according to the word of Jehovah which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:
{15:30} For the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he caused Israel to sin, in his irritation which he irritated Jehovah the God of Israel.
{15:31} And the remainder of the words of Nadab and all which he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Israel?
{15:32} And war was between Asa and between Baasha king of Israel, all their days.
{15:33} In the third year to Asa king of Judah, reigned Baasha son of Ahijah, over all Israel in Tirzah twenty and four years.
{15:34} And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and he will go in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sins which he caused Israel to sin.
{16:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to Jehu, son of Hanani, against Baasha, saying,
{16:2} Because I raised thee up from the dust, and I will give thee chief over my people Israel, and thou wilt go in the way of Jeroboam, and cause my people Israel to sin, to irritate me in their sins.
{16:3} Behold me taking away after Baasha, and after his house; and I gave thy house as the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat.
{16:4} Him dying to Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him dying to him in the field, shall the birds of the heavens eat.
{16:5} And the rest of the words of Baasha, and what he did, and his strength, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Israel?
{16:6} And Baasha will lie down with his fathers, and will be buried in Tirzah and his son Elah will reign in his stead.
{16:7} And also by the hand of Jehu son of Hanani the prophet, the word of Jehovah was against Baasha and against his house, and for all the evil which he did in the eyes of Jehovah to irritate him in the work of his hands to be as the house of Jeroboam, and because he smote him.
{16:8} In the twentieth and sixth year, the year to Asa king of Judah, Elah, son of Baasha reigned over Israel in Tirzah, two years.
{16:9} And Zimri, captain of half his chariots will conspire against him, and he in Tirzah drinking strong drink in the house of Arza, who was over his house in Tirzah.
{16:10} And Zimri will come in and strike him and will kill him in the twentieth and seventh year to Asa king of Judah, and he will reign in his stead.
{16:11} And it will be in his reigning, in his sitting upon the throne, he struck all the house of Baasha; he left not to him, him pissing against the wall, and his near relatives and his friends.
{16:12} And Zimri will destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of Jehovah which he spake against Baasha by the hand of Jehu the prophet.
{16:13} For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and which they caused Israel to sin, to irritate Jehovah the God of Israel by their vanities.
{16:14} And the rest of the words of Elah and what he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Israel?
{16:15} In the twenty and seventh year, the year to Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. And the people encamping in Gibbethon, which was to the rovers.
{16:16} And the people encamping will hear, saying, Zimri conspired and also struck the king; and all Israel will make Omri chief of the army, king over Israel in that day in the camp.
{16:17} And Omri will go up, and all Israel with him, from Gibbethon, and they will press upon Tirzah.
{16:18} And it will be when Zimri saw that the city was taken, and he will come to the fortress of the king's house, and he will burn over him the king's house with fire, and he will die,
{16:19} For his sins which he sinned to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to go in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sins which he did to cause Israel to sin.
{16:20} And the rest of the words of Zimri and his conspiracy which he conspired, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Israel?
{16:21} Then the people of Israel will be divided to half: half of the people were after Tibni, son of Ginath, to make him king; and half, after Omri.
{16:22} And the people will be strengthened which were after Omri over the people which were after Tibni son of Ginath: and Tibni will die, and Omri will reign.
{16:23} In the thirty and one year, the year to Asa king of Judah, Omri reigned over Israel, twelve years; in Tirzah he reigned six years.
{16:24} And he will buy the mountain Shomeron of Shomer with two talents of silver, and he will build the mountain, and call the name of the city which he built after the name of Shomer, lord of the mountain Shomeron.
{16:25} And Omri will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and he will be evil above all who were before him.
{16:26} And he will go in all the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and in his sins which he caused Israel to sin, to irritate Jehovah the God of Israel with their vanities.
{16:27} And the rest of the words of Omri which he did, and his strength which he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Israel?
{16:28} And Omri will lie down with his fathers, and will be buried in Shomeron, and Ahab his son will reign in his stead.
{16:29} And Ahab son of Omri, reigned over Israel in the year the thirty and eighth year to Asa king of Judah: and Ahab son of Omri will reign over Israel in Shomeron twenty and two years.
{16:30} And Ahab son of Omri will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah above all which were before him.
{16:31} And it will be light for him to go in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and he will take a wife, Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Zidonians, and he will go and serve Baal and worship to him.
{16:32} And he will raise up an altar to Baal in the house of Baal which he built in Shomeron.
{16:33} And Ahab will make a statue; and Ahab will add to do to irritate Jehovah the God of Israel above all the kings of Israel which were before him.
{16:34} In his days Hiel of the house of God, built Jericho: in Abiram his first born he will found it, and in Segub his younger he set up its gates, according to the word of Jehovah which he spake by the hand of Joshua son of Nun.
{17:1} And Elijah the Tishbite from the Tishbites of Gilead, will say to Ahab, Jehovah the God of Israel lives whom I stood before him if there shall be dew and rain but according to the mouth of my word.
{17:2} And the word of Jehovah will be to him, saying,
{17:3} Go from hence and turn to thyself east, and hide by the torrent Cherith which is before Jordan.
{17:4} And being thou shalt drink from the torrent; and I commanded the ravens to nourish thee there.
{17:5} And he will go and do according to the word of Jehovah: and he will go and dwell by the torrent Cherith which is upon the face of Jordan.
{17:6} And the ravens bringing to him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he will drink from the torrent.
{17:7} And it will be from the end of days, and the torrent will dry up, for there was no rain upon the earth.
{17:8} And the word of Jehovah will be to him, saying,
{17:9} Arise, go to Zarephath which is to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I commanded a widow woman to nourish thee there.
{17:10} And he will rise and go to Zarephath, and will come to the entrance of the city, and behold there a widow woman gathering wood: and he will call to her, and say, Take now to me a little water in a vessel, and I will drink.
{17:11} And she will go to take, and he will call to her and say, Take now to me a bit of bread in thy hand.
{17:12} And she will say, Jehovah thy God lives, if there is to me a cake, but a handful of flour in a bucket, and a little oil in a cruse: and behold me gathering two woods, and I went to do it for me and for my son, and we shall eat and die.
{17:13} And Elijah will say to her, Thou shalt not fear; go and do according to thy word: but make to me from thence a little cake at first, and bring forth to me, and for thee and for thy son thou shalt make at last.
{17:14} For thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, The bucket of flour shall not be spent, and the cruse of oil shall not fail until the day Jehovah shall give rain upon the face of the earth.
{17:15} And she will go and do according to the word of Elijah: and she will eat, she and he, and her house, days.
{17:16} The bucket of flour was not spent, and the cruse of oil failed no; according to the word of Jehovah which he spake by the hand of Elijah.
{17:17} And it will be after these words, the son of the woman, the lady of the house, was sick, and his sickness was very strong till that breath was not left in him.
{17:18} And she will say to Elijah, What to me and to thee, thou man of God? camest thou to me to bring to remembrance mine iniquity, and to kill my son?
{17:19} And he will say to her, Give to me thy son. And he will take him from her bosom and bring him up into an upper chamber where he sat there, and he will lay him upon his bed.
{17:20} And he will call to Jehovah, and say, Jehovah my God, didst thou also do evil upon the widow which I dwelt with her to kill her son?
{17:21} And he will measure upon the child three times, and he will call to Jehovah, and say, Jehovah my God wilt thou turn back now the soul of this child within his inner part?
{17:22} And Jehovah will hear to the voice of Elijah, and he will turn back the soul of the child within his inner part, and he will live.
{17:23} And Elijah will take the child and bring him down from the upper chamber of the house, and give him to his mother: and Elijah will say, See, thy son lives.
{17:24} And the woman will say to Elijah, Now this I know that thou a man of God, and the word of Jehovah in thy mouth, truth.
{18:1} And it will be many days, and the word of Jehovah was to Elijah in the third year, saying. Go, be seen to Ahab; and I will give rain upon the face of the earth.
{18:2} And Elijah will go to be seen to Ahab. And the famine strong in Shomeron.
{18:3} And Ahab will call for Obadiaha who was over the house. (And Obadiaha was fearing Jehovah greatly:
{18:4} And it will be in Jezebel's cutting off the prophets of Jehovah, and Obadiaha will take a hundred prophets, and hide fifty men in a cave, and he nourished them with bread and water.)
{18:5} And Ahab will say to Obadiaha, Go into the land to all the fountains of waters, and to all the torrents; perhaps we shall find grass and preserve alive the horse and the mule, and we shall not be cut off from the cattle.
{18:6} And they will divide the land to them to pass over in it: Ahab went in one way by himself, and Obadiaha went went in one way by himself.
{18:7} And Obadiaha will be in the way, and behold, Elijah to his meeting: and he will behold him and fall upon his face, and say, Art thou this my lord Elijah?
{18:8} And he will say to him, I. go say to thy lord, Behold, Elijah.
{18:9} And he will say, What did I sin that thou gavest thy servant into the hand of Ahab to kill me?
{18:10} Jehovah thy god lives if there is a nation and kingdom where my lord did not send there to seek thee: and they said, No; and he caused the kingdom and nation to swear that they shall not find.
{18:11} And now thou sayest, Go, say to thy lord, Behold Elijah.
{18:12} And being I shall go from thee and the spirit of Jehovah will lift thee up where I shall not know; and I went to announce to Ahab, and he will not find thee, and he will kill me: and thy servant feared Jehovah from my youth.
{18:13} Was it not announced to my lord what I did in Jezebel's killing the prophets of Jehovah, and I shall hide of the prophets of Jehovah a hundred men, fifty, fifty men in a cave, and I shall nourish them with bread and water?
{18:14} And now thou sayest, Go, say to thy lord, Behold, Elijah; and he will kill me.
{18:15} And Elijah will say to him, Jehovah of armies lives whom I stand before him that this day, I will be seen to him.
{18:16} And Obadiaha will go to meet Ahab, and he will announce to him: and Ahab will go to meet Elijah.
{18:17} And it will be when Ahab saw Elijah, and Ahab will say to him, This thou, troubling Israel?
{18:18} And he will say, I troubled not Israel? but thou and thy father's house in your forsaking the commands of Jehovah, and thou wilt go after the Baals.
{18:19} And now send, gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the pillar, four hundred, eating at the table of Jezebel.
{18:20} And Ahab will send to all the sons of Israel and gather the prophets to mount Carmel.
{18:21} And Elijah will draw near to all the people and say, How long halt ye upon two opinions? if Jehovah is God, go ye after him: and if Baal, go ye after him. And the people answered him not a word.
{18:22} And Elijah will say to the people, I was left alone a prophet to Jehovah; and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty men.
{18:23} And they shall give to us two bullocks; and they shall choose for themselves the one bullock, and cut it in pieces and put upon woods, and put no fire: and I will do the other bullock and give upon woods, and put no fire:
{18:24} And call ye upon the name of your god, and I will call upon the name of Jehovah, and the God who shall answer by fire, he shall be God. And all the people will answer and say, Good the word.
{18:25} And Elijah will say to the prophets of Baal, Choose for yourselves the one bullock, and do first, for ye are many; and call upon the name of your god, and ye shall not put fire.
{18:26} And they will take the bullock which was given to them, and do, and they will call upon the name of Baal, from morning even to noon, saying, O Baal, answer us. And no voice, and none answered. And they will leap upon the altar which was made.
{18:27} And it will be at noon, and Elijah will deride upon them, and he will say, Call with a great voice, for he a god: for he is talking, and because a withdrawing to him, and because a way to him, perhaps he is sleeping, and he will awake.
{18:28} And they will call with a great voice, and they will cut themselves according to their judgment, with swords and with spears, even to the pouring out of blood upon them.
{18:29} And it will be as the noon passed by, and they will prophesy even to the going up of the gift, and no voice, and none answered, and no attention.
{18:30} And Elijah will say to all the people, Draw near to me. And all the people will draw near to him. And he will repair the altar of Jehovah, having been torn down.
{18:31} And Elijah will take twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, whom was the word of Jehovah to him, saying, Israel shall be thy name:
{18:32} And he will build with the stones an altar in the name of Jehovah: and he will make a channel, rolling up two measures of seed, round about the altar.
{18:33} And he will put in order the woods, and he will cut the bullock in pieces and put upon the woods,
{18:34} And he will say, Fill four buckets of water and pour upon the burnt-offering and upon the woods. And he will say, Do a second time. And they will do a second time. And he will say, Do a third time. And they will do a third time.
{18:35} And the waters will go round about the altar; and he also filled the channel with water.
{18:36} And it will be in the going up of the gift, and Elijah the prophet will draw near and say, Jehovah God of Abraham, Isaak, and Israel, this day it shall be known that thou art God in Israel, and I thy servant, and by thy words I did all these words.
{18:37} Answer me, O Jehovah, answer me, and this people shall know that thou art Jehovah God, and thou didst turn their heart backwards.
{18:38} And the fire of Jehovah will fall and will consume the burnt-offering and the woods, and the stones, and the dust, and it licked up the waters which were in the channel.
{18:39} And all the people will see and fall upon their face, and say, Jehovah, he is God; Jehovah he is God.
{18:40} And Elijah will say to them, Seize the prophets of Baal; a man shall not escape from them. And they will seize them, and Elijah will bring them down to the torrent Kishon, and they will slaughter them there.
{18:41} And Elijah will say to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink; for a voice of a multitude of rain.
{18:42} And Ahab will go up to eat and to drink. And Elijah will go up to the head of Carmel and prostrate himself upon the earth, and put his face between his knees.
{18:43} And he will say to his boy, Go up now, look the way of the sea. And he will go up and look, and say, Not any thing. And he will say, Turn back seven times.
{18:44} And it will be in the seventh, and he will say, Behold, a little cloud as the hand of a man, coming up from the sea. And he will say, Go up; say to Ahab, Harness; go down, and the rain shall not hinder thee.
{18:45} And it will be even thus and even thus, and the heavens were darkened with clouds and wind, and there will be a great rain. And Ahab will ride and go to Jezreel.
{18:46} And the hand of Jehovah was to Elijah; and he will bind up his loins, and he will run before Ahab, even to thy Coming to Jezreel.
{19:1} And Ahab will announce to Jezebel all that Elijah did, and all how he killed all the prophets with the sword.
{19:2} And Jezebel will send a messenger to Elijah, saying, Thus will God do and thus will he add that according to the time to-morrow I will set thy soul as the soul of one of them.
{19:3} And he will see and arise, and go for his soul, and he will come to the Well of the Oath which was to Judah, and he will leave his boy there.
{19:4} And he went into the desert the way of a day, and he will come and sit under one broom-tree: and he will ask for his soul to die: and he will say, Much now, O Jehovah, Take my soul, for I am not good above my fathers.
{19:5} And he will lie down and sleep under one broom-tree, and behold, then a messenger touched upon him, and he will say to him, Arise, eat.
{19:6} And he will look, and behold, from his head cakes baked on hot stones, and a cruse of water: and he will eat and drink, and turn back and lie down.
{19:7} And the messenger of Jehovah will turn back the second time, and he will touch upon him, and say, Arise, eat, for much for thee the way.
{19:8} And he will rise and eat and drink, and go in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights, even to the mountain of God, Horeb.
{19:9} And he will go there into a cave and lodge there; and behold, the word of Jehovah to him, and he will say to him, What to thee here Elijah?
{19:10} And he will say, Being zealous I was zealous for Jehovah the God of armies: for the sons of Israel forsook thy covenant; they tore down thine altars, and thy prophets they killed with the sword, and I alone shall be left; and they will seek my soul to take it.
{19:11} And he will say, Go forth and stand upon the mountain before Jehovah And behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind weakening the mountains, and breaking the rocks before Jehovah; Jehovah not in the wind: and after the wind, a shaking; Jehovah not in the shaking:
{19:12} And after the shaking, a fire; Jehovah not in the fire: and after the fire, a voice of light stillness.
{19:13} And it will be when Elijah heard, he will cover his face in his large cloak, and he will go forth and stand at the opening of the cave; and behold, to him a voice, and it will say, What to thee here, Elijah?
{19:14} And he will say, Being zealous, I was zealous for Jehovah the God of armies, for the sons of Israel forsook thy covenant; thine altars they tore down, and thy prophets they killed with the sword, and I alone shall be left; and they will seek my soul to take it.
{19:15} And Jehovah will say to him, Go, turn back to thy way of the desert of Damascus: and come and anoint Hazael for king over Aram:
{19:16} And Jehu, son of Nimshi, shalt thou anoint for king over Israel: and Elisha son of Shaphat, from Abel-Meholah, It thou anoint for prophet in thy stead.
{19:17} And it was him escaping from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu kill: and him escaping from the sword of Jehu, shall Elisha.
{19:18} And I left in Israel seven thousand, all the knees which bowed not to Baal, and every mouth which kissed him not.
{19:19} And he will go from thence and find Elisha son of Shaphat, and he ploughed with twelve yoke before him, and he with the twelve: and Elijah will pass away by him, and he will cast his wide cloak to him.
{19:20} And he will forsake the oxen and run after Elijah, and say, I will kiss now to my father and to my mother, and I will go after thee. And he will say to him, Go, turn back; for what did I to thee?
{19:21} And he will turn back from after him and take a yoke of oxen and sacrifice them, and with the instruments of the oxen he boiled them the flesh, and he will give to the people, and they will eat. And he will rise and go after Elijah and serve him.
{20:1} And the son of Hadad, king of Aram, gathered all his strength; and thirty and two kings with him, and horses and chariots: and he will go up and press upon Shomeron and war against her.
{20:2} And he will send messengers to Ahab, king of Israel, to the city,
{20:3} And he will say to him, Thus said the son of Hadad, Thy silver and thy gold it is to me; and thy wives and thy sons, the good, they are to me.
{20:4} And the king of Israel will answer and say, According to thy word, my lord the king, to thee am I and all which is to me.
{20:5} And the messengers will turn back and say, Thus said Ben-hadad, saying, That I sent to thee, saying, Thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy sons thou shalt give to me,
{20:6} But about the time to-morrow I will send my servants to thee, and they searched thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it was all the delight of thine eyes they shall put in their hand and take.
{20:7} And the king of Israel will call for all the old men of the land, and he will say, Know now, and see that this seeks evil, for he sent to me for my wives and for my sons, and for my silver, and for my gold, and I withheld not from him.
{20:8} And all the old men and all the people will say to him, Thou shalt not hear, and thou shalt not be willing.
{20:9} And he will say to the messengers of Ben-hadad, Say to my lord the king, All which thou sentest to thy servant at first, I will do: and this word I shall not be able to do. And the messengers will go and turn back word.
{20:10} And Ben-hadad will send to him and say, Thus will the gods do to me, and thus will they add, if the dust of Shomeron shall suffice for handfuls for all the people which are at my feet.
{20:11} And the king of Israel will answer and say, Speak ye. He binding shall not boast as he loosening.
{20:12} And it will be when he heard this word he was drinking, and the kings in the booths; and he will say to his servants, Set ye. And they will set against the city.
{20:13} And behold, one prophet drew near to Ahab king of Israel, and he will say, Thus said Jehovah, Sawest thou all this great multitude? Behold me giving it into thy hand this day and thou knewest that I am Jehovah.
{20:14} And Ahab will say, By whom? And he will say, Thus said Jehovah, By the boys of the chiefs of the provinces. And he will say, Who shall bind the war? And he will say, Thou.
{20:15} And he will review the boys of the chiefs of the provinces, and they will be two hundred and thirty: and after them he reviewed all the people, all the sons of Israel, seven thousand.
{20:16} And they will go forth at noon. And Ben-hadad was drinking strong drink in the booths, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings helping him.
{20:17} And the boys of the chiefs of the provinces will go forth at the first; and Ben-hadad will send and they will announce to him, saying, Men came forth from Shomeron.
{20:18} And he will say, If for peace they came forth, seize them living; and if for war they came forth, seize them living.
{20:19} And these came forth from the city, the boys of the chiefs of the provinces, and the strength which was after them.
{20:20} And they will strike a man his man: and Aram will flee, and Israel will pursue them: and Ben-hadad king of Aram, will escape upon a horse, and the horsemen.
{20:21} And the king of Israel will go forth and strike the horse and the chariot, and he struck upon Aram a great blow.
{20:22} And the prophet will draw near to the king of Israel, and say to him, Go, be strengthened, and know, and see what thou wilt do: for at the return of the year the king of Aram will come up against thee.
{20:23} And the servants of the king of Aram said to him, A god of the mountains is their God; for this they were strong above us; and on the contrary, we will war with them in a plain; surely, shall we not be strong above them?
{20:24} And do this word, Remove the kings a man from his place, and put prefects in their stead.
{20:25} And thou shalt divide out to thee an army, as the army having fallen from thee, and horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will war with them in the plain; surely, shall we not be strong above them? And he will hear to their voice and do so.
{20:26} And it will be at the return of the year, and Ben-hadad will review Aram, and he will go up to Aphek to the war with the king of Israel.
{20:27} And the sons of Israel were reviewed, and were nourished, and they will go up to their meeting: and the sons of Israel will encamp over against them as two flocks of she goats; and Aram filled the land.
{20:28} And a man of God will come near and say to the king of Israel, and he will say, Thus said Jehovah, Because Aram said, A God of the mountains is Jehovah, and he is not the God of the valleys, and I gave all this great multitude into thy hand; and know ye that I am Jehovah.
{20:29} And these will encamp over against those seven days. And it will be in the seventh day, and the battle will draw near: and the sons of Israel will strike Aram a hundred thousand footmen in one day.
{20:30} And the rest will flee to Aphek, to the city; and the wall will fall upon twenty and seven thousand men being left And Ben-hadad fled, and he will come to the city, to a chamber in a chamber.
{20:31} And his servants will say to him, Behold now, we heard that the kings of the house of Israel that they are kings of mercy; we will now put sackcloth upon our loins and ropes upon our heads, and we will go forth to the king of Israel; perhaps he will save alive thy soul.
{20:32} And they will bind sackcloth upon their loins, and ropes upon their heads, and they will come to the king of Israel, and say, Thy servant Ben-hadad said, Now wilt thou save alive my soul? And he will say, Is he yet living? he is my brother.
{20:33} And the men will prognosticate, and hasten, and urge whether it was from him, and they will say, Thy brother Benhadad. And he will say, Go take him. And Benhadad will come forth to him, and he will bring him up upon his chariot.
{20:34} And he will say to him, The cities which my father took from thy father, I will turn back; and thou shalt set streets for thee in Damascus, according as my father set in Shomeron. And I will send thee away with a covenant. And he will cut out to him a covenant and send him away.
{20:35} And a man, one of the sons of the prophets, said to his neighbor in the word of Jehovah, Strike me now. And the man refused to strike him.
{20:36} And he will say to him, Because thou heardst not to the voice of Jehovah, behold thee going from me, and the lion striking thee. And he will go from beside him, and the lion will find him and strike him.
{20:37} And he will find another man, and he will say, Strike me now. And the man will strike him, striking and wounding.
{20:38} And the prophet will go and stand by the king by the way; and he will be disguised with a bandage over his eyes.
{20:39} And it will be the king passing by, and he cried to the king, and he will say, Thy servant went forth into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside, and he will bring a man to me, and say, Watch this man: if missing, he shall be missed, and thy soul being instead of his soul, or thou shalt weigh a talent of silver.
{20:40} And it will be thy servant doing here and there, and he was not. And the king of Israel will say to him, Thus thy judgment; thou didst decide.
{20:41} And he will hasten and remove the bandage from his eyes; and the king of Israel will know him that he is from the prophets.
{20:42} And he will say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Because thou sentest away a man I devoted to destruction from thy hand, and thy soul being instead of his soul, and thy people instead of his people.
{20:43} And the king of Israel will go to his house, rebellious and angry; and he will come to Shomeron.
{21:1} And it will be after these words, and a vineyard was to Naboth the Jezreelite which was in Jezreel, by the palace of Ahab king of Shomeron.
{21:2} And Ahab will speak to Naboth, saying, Wilt thou give to me thy vineyard? and it shall be to me for a garden of herbs, for it is near by my house: and I will give to thee in its stead a vineyard good above it; if good in thine eyes I will give thee silver the price of this.
{21:3} And Naboth will say to Ahab, Far be it to me from Jehovah, my giving the inheritance of my fathers to thee.
{21:4} And Ahab will come to his house rebellious and angry for the word that Naboth the Jezreelite spake to him: and he will say, I will not give to thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he will lie down upon his bed and turn away his face, and not eat bread.
{21:5} And Jezebel his wife will come to him, and she will speak to him, What this thy spirit rebellious, and thou not eating bread?
{21:6} And he will speak to her, Because I shall speak to Naboth the Jezreelite and say to him, Thou shalt give to me thy vineyard for silver; or if thou art willing, I will give to thee a vineyard in its stead. And he will say, I will not give to thee my vineyard.
{21:7} And Jezebel his wife will say to him, Thou now wilt do the kingdom over Israel: arise, eat bread, and do thy heart good: I will give to thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
{21:8} And she will write letters in the name of Ahab, and seal with his seal; and she will send the letters to the old men, and to the nobles who were in his city dwelling with Naboth.
{21:9} And she will write in the letters, Saying, Call a fast; set Naboth in the head of the people:
{21:10} And set two men, sons of Belial, over against him, and they shall bear witness, saying, Thou didst praise God and the king. And they shall bring him forth and stone him, and he shall die.
{21:11} And the men of his city, the old men and the nobles, who were dwelling in his city, will do as Jezebel sent to them, according to what was written in the letters which she sent to them.
{21:12} They called a fast; they will set Naboth upon the head of the people.
{21:13} And two men will come, sons of Belial, and they will set before him: and the men of Belial will testify against Naboth before the people, saying, Naboth praised Jehovah and the king. And they will bring him without the city, and stone him with stones, and he will die.
{21:14} And they will send to Jezebel, saying, Naboth was stoned, and he will die.
{21:15} And it will be when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned and he will die, and Jezebel will say to Ahab, Arise, inherit the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give to thee for silver: for Naboth is not living, but dead.
{21:16} And it will be when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, and Ahab will rise to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, and to possess it.
{21:17} And the word of Jehovah will be to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
{21:18} Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Shomeron: behold, in the vineyard of Naboth where he went down there to possess it.
{21:19} And speak to him, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Didst thou kill and also possess? And speak to him, saying, said Jehovah, In the place which the dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs shall lick thy blood, also thine.
{21:20} And Ahab will say to Elijah, Didst thou find me, O mine enemy? And he will say I found: because thou didst sell thyself to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah,
{21:21} Behold me bringing evil to thee, and I took away after thee, and I cut off to Ahab him pissing against a wall and him shut up and left in Israel;
{21:22} And I gave thy house as the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and as the house of Baasha, son of Ahijah, for the irritation which thou didst irritate, and thou wilt cause Israel to sin.
{21:23} And also to Jezebel spake Jehovah, saying, Dogs shall eat Jezebel in the fortification of Jezebel.
{21:24} Him dying to Ahab in the city shall dogs eat; and him dying in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.
{21:25} Only there was not as Ahab who was sold to do evil in the eves of Jehovah, whom Jezebel stimulated him.
{21:26} And he will cause abhorrence exceeding to go after blocks, according to all which the Amorites did whom Jehovah dispossessed from the face of the sons of Israel.
{21:27} And it will be when Ahab heard these words, and he will rend his garments, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and he will fast and lie down in sackcloth, and go softly.
{21:28} And the word of Jehovah will be to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
{21:29} Thou sawest that Ahab humbled himself from before me. Because that he humbled himself from before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: in the days of his sons I will bring the evil upon his house.
{22:1} And they will dwell three years, no war between Aram and between Israel.
{22:2} And it will be in the third year, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to the king of Israel.
{22:3} And the king of Israel will say to his servants, Ye knew that to us Ramoth-Gilead, and we being inactive taking it from the hand of the king of Aram.
{22:4} And he will say to Jehoshaphat, Go with me to battle to Ramoth-Gilead. And Jehoshaphat will say to the king of Israel, As me, as thee; as my people, as thy people; as my horses, as thy horses.
{22:5} And Jehoshaphat will say to the king of Israel, Seek now, according to the day, the word of Jehovah.
{22:6} And the king of Israel will gather together the prophets, about four hundred men, and he will say to them. Shall I go to Ramoth-Gilead to war, or shall I desist? and they will say, Go up; and Jehovah will give into the hand of the king.
{22:7} And Jehoshaphat will say, Is there not here yet a prophet to Jehovah, and we will seek from him?
{22:8} And the king of Israel will say to Jehoshaphat, Yet one man to seek Jehovah from him, and I hated him, for he will not prophesy good concerning me, but evil, Micaiah, son of Imlah And Jehoshaphat will say, The king shall not say thus.
{22:9} And the king of Israel will call for one eunuch, and say, Hasten, Micaiah, son of Imlah.
{22:10} And the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, sitting each upon his throne, putting on their garments in the area of the opening of the gate of Shomeron; and all the prophets prophesying before them.
{22:11} And Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, will make to him horns of iron: and he will say, Thus said Jehovah, With these shalt thou push Aram till thou finished them.
{22:12} And all the prophets prophesying thus, saying, Go up to Ramoth-Gilead and prosper: and Jehovah gave into the hand of the king.
{22:13} And the messenger who went to call Micaiah, spake to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets of one mouth good to the king: will thy words now be according to the word of one of them, and speak thou good?
{22:14} And Micaiah will say, Jehovah lives, for what Jehovah shall say to me I will speak it.
{22:15} And he will come to the king, and the king will say to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-Gilead to war, or shall we desist? And he will say to him, Go up, and prosper: and Jehovah gave into the hand of the king.
{22:16} And the king will say to him, Till how many times do I cause thee to swear that thou wilt not speak to me only truth in the name of Jehovah?
{22:17} And he will say, I saw all Israel scattered to the mountains as sheep which not to them a shepherd: and Jehovah will say, No lords to these; they shall turn back a man to his house in peace.
{22:18} And the king of Israel will say to Jehoshaphat, Did I not say to thee he will not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
{22:19} And he will say, For this, hear the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the army of the heavens standing by him from his right hand and from his left.
{22:20} And Jehovah will say, Who will deceive Ahab, and he shall go up and fall in Ramoth-Gilead? and this will say according to this, and this said according to this.
{22:21} And the spirit will go forth and stand before Jehovah, and he will say, I will deceive him. And Jehovah will say, By what?
{22:22} And he will say, I will go forth and be to him a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he will say, Thou shalt deceive, and thou shalt be able: go forth and do thus.
{22:23} And now behold, Jehovah gave a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and Jehovah spake evil concerning thee.
{22:24} And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah will come near, and strike Micaiah upon the cheek, saying, Where passed the spirit of Jehovah from me to speak to thee?
{22:25} And Micaiah will say, Behold thee seeing in that day when thou shalt go into a chamber, in a chamber to hide thyself.
{22:26} And the king of Israel will say, Take Micaiah and turn him back to Amon, chief of the city, and to Joash son of the king.
{22:27} And say, Thus said the king, Put this in the house of shutting up, and cause him to eat the bread of oppression and the waters of oppression till my coming in peace.
{22:28} And Micaiah will say, If turning back, thou shalt turn back in peace, Jehovah spake not in me. And he will say, Hear, ye peoples, all of them.
{22:29} And the king of Israel will go up, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, to Ramoth-Gilead.
{22:30} And the king of Israel will say to Jehoshaphat, Disguising myself and going into the war; and thou put on thy garments. And the king of Israel will see himself, and will go into the war.
{22:31} And the king of Aram commanded the chiefs of the chariots which were to him, thirty and two, saying, Ye shall not fight with little and with great, but with the king of Israel alone.
{22:32} And it will be when the chiefs of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, and they said, Surely he is the king of Israel. And they will turn aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat will cry out.
{22:33} And it will be when the chiefs of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, and they will turn back from after him.
{22:34} And a man drew with a bow in his simplicity, and he will strike the king of Israel between the joinings and between the coat of mail; and he will say to his driver, Turn thy hand, and bring me forth from the war, for I was wounded.
{22:35} And the battle will go up in that day: and the king was fixed in the chariot over against Aram, and he will die in the evening: and the blood of the wound will flow into the bosom of the chariot.
{22:36} And a shout of joy will pass through in the camp as the sun went down, saying, A man to his city, and a man to his land.
{22:37} And the king will die, and he will be brought to Shomeron; and they will bury the king in Shomeron.
{22:38} And one will inundate the chariot in the pool of Shomeron; and the dogs will lick his blood; and the harlots washed, according to the word of Jehovah which he spake.
{22:39} And the rest of the words of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house, which he built, and all the cities which he built, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Israel?
{22:40} And Ahab will lie down with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son will reign in his stead.
{22:41} And Jehoshaphat son of Asa, reigned over Judah in the fourth year to Ahab king of Israel.
{22:42} Jehoshaphat the son of thirty and five years in his reigning; and twenty and five years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Azubah, daughter of Shilhi.
{22:43} And he went in all the way of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it to do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah: But the heights were not removed; the people yet sacrificing and burning incense upon the heights.
{22:44} And Jehoshaphat will make peace with the king of Israel.
{22:45} And the rest of the words of Jehoshaphat, and his strength that he did, and how he warred, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?
{22:46} And the remainder of the holy place which was left in the days of Asa his father, he took away from the land.
{22:47} And a king not in Edom: a director reigned.
{22:48} Jehoshaphat built ships of Tharshish to go to Ophrah for gold: and it went not, for the ships were broken in Ezion-Geber.
{22:49} Then said Ahaziah son of Ahab, to Jehoshaphat, My servants shall go with thy servants in the ships. And Jehoshaphat would not.
{22:50} And Jehoshaphat will lie down with his fathers, and be buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son will reign in his stead.
{22:51} And Ahaziah son of Ahab reigned over Israel in Shomeron in the seventeenth year to Jehoshaphat king of Judah; and he will reign over Israel two years.
{22:52} And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah and go in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin:
{22:53} For he will serve Baal and worship to him, and he will irritate Jehovah the God of Israel according to all which his father did.
