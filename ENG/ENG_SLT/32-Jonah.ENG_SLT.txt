{1:1} And the word of Jehovah shall be to Jonah, son of Amittai, saying,
{1:2} Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and call against it; for their evil came up before me.
{1:3} And Jonah will rise up to flee to Tarshish from the face of Jehovah, and he will go down to Joppa; and he will find a ship going to Tarshish, and be will give his hire, and he will go down in it to go with them to Tarshish from the face of Jehovah.
{1:4} And Jehovah cast down a great wind upon the sea, and there will be a great storm upon the sea, and the ship was thought to be broken.
{1:5} And the seamen will fear, and they will cry each to his God, and they cast down the vessels which were in the ship into the sea to lighten from them. And Jonah went down to the sides of the ship, and he will lie down and snore.
{1:6} And the chief sailor will draw near to him and say to him, What to thee, thou snoring? Arise, and call to thy God; perhaps thy God will work for us and we shall not perish.
{1:7} And they will say each to his neighbor, Come, and we will cast the lot, and we shall know for the retributions of this evil to us. And they will cast lots, and the lot will fall upon Jonah.
{1:8} And they will say to him, Announce now to us, on account of whom is this evil to us? what thy work? and from whence wilt thou come? what thy land? and from what people art thou?
{1:9} And he will say to them, I an Hebrew; and I feared Jehovah God of the heavens, who made the sea and the dry land.
{1:10} And the men will fear a great fear, and they will say to him, What this thou didst? For the men knew that he fled from the face of Jehovah, for he announced to them.
{1:11} And they will say to him, What shall we do to thee and the sea shall subside from you? For the sea went and tossed about.
{1:12} And he will say to them, Lift me up and cast me down to the sea, and the sea will subside from you: For I shall know on my account this great storm is upon you.
{1:13} And the men will break through to turn back to the dry land, and they will not be able, for the sea went and tossed about against them.
{1:14} And they will call to Jehovah, and say, Ah, now, O Jehovah, not now shall we perish for the soul of this man, and thou wilt not give upon us innocent blood: for thou Jehovah didst as thou pleased.
{1:15} And they will lift up Jonah and cast him down into the sea: and the sea will stand from its foam.
{1:16} And the men feared Jehovah with great fear, and they will sacrifice a sacrifice to Jehovah, and they will vow vows.
{1:17} And Jehovah will prepare a great fish to swallow down Jonah: and Jonah will be in the bowels of the fish three days and three nights.
{2:1} And Jonah will pray to Jehovah his God from the bowels of the fish,
{2:2} And he will say, I called out of straits to me to Jehovah, and he will answer me; from the belly of hades I cried for help, thou heardest my voice.
{2:3} And thou wilt cast me into the depth, into the heart of the seas; and the river will surround me: all thy breakers and thy waves passed over me.
{2:4} And I said, I was driven from before thine eyes; yet I shall add to look to thy holy temple.
{2:5} The waters encompassed me even to the soul: the deep will surround me, the sedge was bound to my head.
{2:6} I shall go down to the cuttings off of the mountains; the earth, her bars about me forever: and thou wilt bring up my life from corruption, O Jehovah my God.
{2:7} In my soul fainting upon me I remembered Jehovah: and my prayers will come in to thee to thy holy temple.
{2:8} They watching the vanities of falsehood will forsake their kindness.
{2:9} And I will sacrifice to thee with the voice of praise; what I vowed I will requite. Salvation is to Jehovah.
{2:10} And Jehovah will say to the fish, and he will vomit forth Jonah upon the dry land.
{3:1} And the word of Jehovah will be to Jonah the second time, saying,
{3:2} Arise, go to Nineveh the great city, and call to it the calling which I speak to thee.
{3:3} And Jonah will rise and go to Nineveh according to the word of Jehovah. And Nineveh was a great city to God, the going of three days.
{3:4} And Jonah will begin to go in to the city the going of one day, and he will call, and say, Yet forty days and Nineveh being overthrown.
{3:5} And the men of Nineveh will believe in God, and they will call a fast, and put on sackcloth, from great and even to small.
{3:6} And the word will reach to the king of Nineveh, and he will rise from his throne, and he will take away his wide cloak from off him, and he will cover with sackcloth, and he will sit upon ashes.
{3:7} And he will cry out and say in Nineveh from the edict of the king and of his great ones, saying, The man and beast, the herd and flock shall not taste of anything; they shall not feed and they shall not drink water.
{3:8} And man and beast shall be covered with sackcloth, and they shall cry with strength to Jehovah: and they shall turn back each from his evil way, and the violence which is in their hands.
{3:9} Who shall know God will turn back and lament, and turning back from the burning of his anger and we shall not perish?
{3:10} And God will see their works that they turned back from their evil way, and God will lament for the evil which he spake to do to them: and he did it not.
{4:1} And it will be evil to Jonah, a great evil, and it will kindle to him.
{4:2} And he will pray to Jehovah and say, Ah, now, O Jehovah, was not this my word while I was upon my land? For this I anticipated to flee to Tarshish, for I knew that thou art merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and of much kindness, and lamenting for evil.
{4:3} And now, O Jehovah, take now my soul from me, for it is good for me to die rather than for me to live.
{4:4} And Jehovah will say, Didst thou well for thee to be angry?
{4:5} And Jonah will go out of the city, and sit from the east to the city, and he make to him there a tent, and he will sit under it in the shadow, even till he shall see what will be upon the city.
{4:6} And Jehovah God will appoint a gourd, and it will come up from above to Jonah to be a shadow over his head to deliver to him from his evil. And Jonah will rejoice over the gourd with great joy.
{4:7} And God will appoint a worm in the going up of the morning for the morrow, and it will strike the gourd, and it will dry up.
{4:8} And it will be as the sun rose, and God will appoint a sultry east wind; and the sun struck upon the head of Jonah, and he will faint, and he will ask his soul to die, and say, It is good for me to die rather than live.
{4:9} And God will say to Jonah, Was it well to kindle to thee for the gourd? And he will say, It was well to kindle to me, even to death.
{4:10} And Jehovah will say, Thou didst spare for the gourd, which thou didst not labor for it, and thou didst not cause it to grow; it was the youth of a night, and the son of a night perished.
{4:11} And shall I not spare for Nineveh the great city which there is in it more than one hundred and twenty thousand men which knew not between his right hand to his left, and many cattle?
