{1:1} In the eighth month, in the second year to Darius, was the word of Jehovah to Zechariah son of Barachiah, son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
{1:2} Jehovah was angry with our fathers with anger.
{1:3} And thou saidst to them, Thus said Jehovah of armies: Turn back to me, says Jehovah of armies, and I will turn back to you, said Jehovah of armies.
{1:4} Ye shall not be as your fathers which the former prophets called to them, saying, Thus, said Jehovah of armies: Turn back now from your evil ways and your evil doings: and they heard not, and they attended not to me, says Jehovah.
{1:5} Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, shall they live forever?
{1:6} But the words and the laws which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not reach your fathers? and they will turn back and say, As Jehovah of armies purposed to do to us according to our ways and according to our doings, so he did with us.
{1:7} In the twenty and fourth day to the eleventh month, this the month Sabat, in the second year to Darius, was the word of Jehovah to Zechariah, son of Barachiah, son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
{1:8} I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood between the myrtles which were in shady place; and after him red horses, bay, and white.
{1:9} And saying, What these, my lord? And the messenger speaking with me, will say to me, I will cause thee to see what these are?
{1:10} And the man standing between the myrtles will answer and say, These which Jehovah sent to go about in the earth.
{1:11} And they will answer the messenger of Jehovah standing between the myrtles, and they will say, We walked about in the earth, and behold, all the earth sat and rested.
{1:12} And the messenger of Jehovah will answer and say, O Jehovah of armies, how long wilt thou not compassionate Jerusalem and the cities of Judah with whom thou wert very angry this seventy years?
{1:13} And Jehovah will answer the messenger speaking with me good words, consoling words.
{1:14} And the messenger speaking with me, will say to me, Call thou, saying, Thus said Jehovah of armies; I was jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with great jealousy.
{1:15} And I am angry with great anger against the nations living in quiet: for I was angry a little and they helped for evil.
{1:16} For this, thus said Jehovah: I turned back to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, says Jehovah of armies, and a cord shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.
{1:17} Yet call, say, Thus said Jehovah of armies: My cities shall be spread abroad for good; and Jehovah yet comforted Zion and yet chose Jerusalem.
{1:18} And I shall lift up mine eyes, and see, and behold, four horns.
{1:19} And saying to the messenger speaking with me, What these? And he will say to me, These the horns which scattered Judah, and Israel, and Jerusalem.
{1:20} And Jehovah caused me to see four artificers.
{1:21} And saying, What came these to do? And he will say, saying, These the horns which scattered Judah, so that a man lifted not up his head: and these will come to terrify them, to cast out the horns of the nations lifting up the horn to the land of Judah to scatter it.
{2:1} I shall lift up mine eyes and see, and behold, a man, and in his hand a cord of measure.
{2:2} And saying, Whither goest thou? And he will say to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see according to what its breadth, and according to what its length.
{2:3} And behold, the messenger speaking with me went forth, and another messenger went forth to meet him:
{2:4} And he will say to him, Run, speak to this youth, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited an open country from the multitude of men and cattle in the midst of her.
{2:5} And I will be to her, says Jehovah, a wall of fire round about, and I will be for glory in the midst of her.
{2:6} Alas! alas! and flee ye from the land of the north, says Jehovah: for as the four winds of the heavens I spread you abroad, says Jehovah.
{2:7} Alas, O Zion, deliver thyself inhabiting the daughter of Babel.
{2:8} For thus said Jehovah of armies: After glory he sent me to the nations spoiling you: for he touching upon you touched the gate of his eye.
{2:9} For behold me waving my hand upon them, and they were a spoil to their servants: and ye knew that Jehovah of armies sent me.
{2:10} Shout for joy and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for behold me coming, and I dwelt in the midst of thee, says Jehovah.
{2:11} And many nations joined themselves to Jehovah in that day, and they were to me for a people: and I dwelt in the midst of thee, and thou knewest that Jehovah of armies sent me to thee.
{2:12} And Jehovah inherited Judah his portion upon the holy land, and he yet chose Jerusalem.
{2:13} Be silent, all flesh, from the face of Jehovah: for he was raised from the habitation of his holiness.
{3:1} And he will cause me to see Joshua the great priest standing before the messenger of Jehovah, and the adversary standing upon his right hand for his adversary.
{3:2} And Jehovah will say to the adversary, And Jehovah will rebuke in thee, thou adversary: and Jehovah having chosen in Jerusalem will rebuke in thee: is not this a fire-brand snatched from the fire?
{3:3} And Joshua was clothed in filthy garments, and he stood before the messenger.
{3:4} And he will answer and say to them standing before him, saying, Remove the filthy garments from off him, And he will say to him, See, I caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and clothed thee with festive garments.
{3:5} And saying, They shall set a pure turban upon his head; and they will set the pure turban upon his head, and they will put on the garments. And the messenger of Jehovah stood.
{3:6} And the messenger of Jehovah will protest to Joshua, saying,
{3:7} Thus said Jehovah of armies: If thou wilt go in my way, and if thou shalt watch my watches, and thou also shalt judge my house, and also thou shalt watch my enclosure, and I gave to thee the goings between these standing by.
{3:8} Hear now, O Joshua the great priest, thou and thy friends sitting before thee, for they are men of wonder: for behold me bringing my servant the Sprout.
{3:9} For behold the stone which I gave before Joshua; upon one stone seven eyes: behold me engraving its engraving, says Jehovah of armies, and I removed the iniquity of that land in one day.
{3:10} In that day, says Jehovah of armies, ye shall call each his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.
{4:1} And the messenger speaking with me will turn back and rouse me up as a man that will be roused from his sleep.
{4:2} And he will say to me, What seest thou? And saying, I saw, and behold, a candlestick of gold, all of it, and a bowl upon its head, and its seven lights upon it, and seven tubes to the seven lights which were upon its head:
{4:3} And two olive trees upon it, one from the right of the bowl and one from its left.
{4:4} And I shall answer and say to the messenger speaking with me, saying, What are these, my lord?
{4:5} And the messenger speaking with me will answer and say to me, Knewest thou not what these are? And saying, No, my lord.
{4:6} And he will answer And say to me, saying, This the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by strength, not by power, but by my spirit, said Jehovah of armies.
{4:7} Who art thou, O great mountain? before the face of Zerubbabel for a level region. And he brought forth the stone of the head, a noise: Grace, grace to it.
{4:8} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{4:9} The hands of Zerubbabel founded this house, and his hands shall complete it; and thou knewest that Jehovah of armies sent me to you.
{4:10} For who despised the day of small things? and they rejoiced, and they saw the stone of tin in the hand of Zerubbabel, these seven; they the eyes of Jehovah running to and fro in all the earth.
{4:11} And I shall answer and say to him, What these two olive trees upon the right of the candlestick and upon its left?
{4:12} And I shall answer the second time, and say to him, What these two twigs of the olive trees which by the hand of the two tubes of gold emptying from them the gold?
{4:13} And he will say to me, saying, Knewest thou not what these are? And saying, No, my lord.
{4:14} And he will say, These the two sons of new oil standing by the Lord, of all the earth.
{5:1} And I shall turn back and lift up mine eyes and see, and behold, a roll flying.
{5:2} And he will say to me, What seest thou? And saying, I see a roll flying; its length twenty by the cubit, and its breadth, ten by the cubit.
{5:3} And he will say to me, This the curse going forth upon the face of all the earth: for every one stealing from thence was empty like it; and every one swearing from this was empty like it.
{5:4} I brought it forth, says Jehovah of armies, and it came into the house of the thief, and into the house of him swearing for falsehood in my name: and it lodged in the midst of his house, and it finished it and its wood and its stones.
{5:5} And the messenger speaking with me will go forth and say to me, Lift up now thine eyes and see what this going forth.
{5:6} And saying, What is it? And he will say to me, This the ephah going forth. And he will say, This their eye in all the earth.
{5:7} And behold, a talent of lead was lifted up: and this one woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.
{5:8} And he will say, This injustice. And he will cast her into the midst of the ephah; and he will cast a stone of lead upon its mouth.
{5:9} And I shall lift up mine eyes and see, and behold, two women will come forth, and the wind in their wings; and to them wings as the wings of the stork; and they shall lift up the ephah between the earth and between the heavens.
{5:10} And saying to the messenger speaking with me, Whither do they carry the ephah?
{5:11} And he will say to me, To build for it a house in the land of Shiner: and it was prepared, and set there upon her base.
{6:1} And I shall turn back and lift up mine eyes and see, and behold, four chariots going forth from between two mountains; and the mountains, mountains of brass.
{6:2} In the first chariot, red horses; and in the second chariot, black horses;
{6:3} And in the third chariot, white horses and in the fourth chariot, horses sprinkled with spots, and fleet.
{6:4} And I shall answer and say to the messenger speaking with me, What are these, my lord?
{6:5} And the messenger will answer and say to me, These the four spirits of the heavens going forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.
{6:6} The black horses which are in it, going forth into the land of the north; and the white went forth after them; and the sprinkled with spots went forth to the land of the south.
{6:7} And the fleet went forth and they will seek to go in order to go to and fro in the earth: and he will say, Go; go to and fro in the earth. And they will go to and fro in the earth.
{6:8} And he will cry out with me, and speak to me, saying, See them going forth to the land of the north; they caused my spirit to rest in the land of the north.
{6:9} And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
{6:10} Take from the captivity, from Heldai, from Tobijah, and from Jedaiah, which came from Babel, and come thou in that day and go into the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah;
{6:11} And take silver and gold and make crowns, and set upon the head of Joshua, son of Josedeck the great priest;
{6:12} And say to him, saying, Thus said Jehovah of armies, saying, Behold the man, The Sprout his name; and he shall spring forth from his place and build the temple of Jehovah.
{6:13} And he shall build the temple of Jehovah; and he shall lift up the majesty, and he sat and ruled upon his throne: and he was priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them two.
{6:14} And the crown shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen, son of Zephaniah, for a remembrance in the temple of Jehovah.
{6:15} And they being far off shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah; and ye knew that Jehovah of armies sent me to you. And it was if hearing, ye shall hear to the voice of Jehovah your God.
{7:1} And it will be in the fourth year to Darius the king, the word of Jehovah was to Zechariah in the fourth to the ninth month, in Chisleu;
{7:2} And he will send to the house of God, the chief of the treasure, and the friend of the king, and his men to beseech the face of Jehovah.
{7:3} To speak to the priests which were to the house of Jehovah of armies, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself according as I did, how many the years?
{7:4} And the word of Jehovah of armies was to me, saying,
{7:5} Say to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh, and this seventy years, fasting, fasted ye to me, me?
{7:6} And when ye shall eat, and when ye shall drink, are ye not eating, and are ye not drinking?
{7:7} Is it not the words which Jehovah called by the hand of the former prophets in Jerusalem being inhabited and in security, and its cities round about her, and inhabiting the south and the low country?
{7:8} And the word of Jehovah will be to Zechariah, saying,
{7:9} Thus said Jehovah of armies, saying. Judge ye the judgment of truth, and do mercy and compassions each to his brother.
{7:10} And the widow and the orphan, the stranger and the poor, ye shall not oppress; and ye shall not purpose evil in your heart a man to his brother.
{7:11} And they will refuse to attend, and they will give a stubborn shoulder, and their ears they made heavy from hearing.
{7:12} And their heart they set a diamond from hearing the instruction and the words which Jehovah of armies sent by his spirit by the hand of the former prophets: and there will be great wrath from Jehovah of armies.
{7:13} And it will be as he called and they heard not; so they shall call, and I will not hear, said Jehovah of armies:
{7:14} And I will toss them about among all the nations which they knew not: and the land was desolate after them from passing through and from turning back: and they shall set the land of desire for a desolation.
{8:1} And the word of Jehovah of armies will be, saying,
{8:2} Thus said Jehovah of armies: I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy and with great wrath was I jealous for her.
{8:3} Thus said Jehovah: I turned back to Zion, and I dwelt in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem was called, The city of truth; and the mountain of Jehovah of armies, The holy mountain.
{8:4} Thus said Jehovah of armies: Yet shall old men and old women sit in the broad places of Jerusalem, and a man his support in his hand from the multitude of days.
{8:5} And the broad places of the city shall be filled with boys and girls playing in her broad places.
{8:6} Thus said Jehovah of armies: If it shall be wonderful in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, also shall it be wonderful in mine eyes, says Jehovah of armies:
{8:7} Thus said Jehovah of armies: Behold me saving my people from the land of the sun rising, and from the land of the going down of the sun.
{8:8} And I brought them, and they dwelt in the midst of Jerusalem: and they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God, in truth and in justice.
{8:9} Thus said Jehovah of armies: Your hands shall be strong, ye bearing in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day the house of Jehovah of armies was founded for the temple to be built.
{8:10} For before these days there was no hire of man, and not any hire of cattle; and to him going out, and to him coming in, no peace from the straits: and I will send all the men each against his neighbor.
{8:11} And now not as the former days am I to the remnant of this people, says Jehovah of armies.
{8:12} For the seed of peace; the vine shall give her fruit and the earth shall give her produce, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I caused the remnant of this people to inherit all these.
{8:13} And it was as ye were a curse in the nations, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so I will save you, and ye were a praise: ye shall not fear; your hands shall be strengthened.
{8:14} For thus said Jehovah of armies; As I had in mind to do evil to you in your fathers provoking me to anger, said Jehovah of armies, and, I lamented not.
{8:15} So I turned back; I had in mind in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: ye shall not fear.
{8:16} These the words which ye shall do: speak the truth each with his neighbor; truth and the judgment of peace judge ye in your gates.
{8:17} And ye shall not purpose evil, a man to his neighbor, in your heart; and ye shall not love the oath of falsehood: for all these which I hated, says Jehovah.
{8:18} And the word of Jehovah of armies will be to me, saying,
{8:19} Thus said Jehovah of armies: The fast of the fourth, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah for joy and for gladness, and for good appointments; and love ye truth and peace.
{8:20} Thus said Jehovah of armies: Yet that peoples shall come, and the inhabitants of many cities:
{8:21} And the inhabitants of one went to one, saying, We will go, going to beseech the face of Jehovah, and to seek Jehovah of armies: I will go also.
{8:22} And many peoples and strong nations came to seek Jehovah of armies in Jerusalem, and to beseech the face of Jehovah.
{8:23} Thus said Jehovah of armies: In those days, that ten men shall take hold from all tongues of the nations, and they took hold of the wing of a man a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we heard God is with you.
{9:1} The lifting up of the word of Jehovah in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus its gift: when to Jehovah the eye of man and all the tribes of Israel.
{9:2} And also Hamath shall be the bound in it; Tyre and Zidon, for it was wise exceedingly.
{9:3} And Tyre will build for herself a fortress, and she will heap up silver as the dust, and gold as the mud of the streets.
{9:4} Behold, Jehovah will dispossess her, and he struck her strength in the sea; and she shall be devoured by fire.
{9:5} Ashkelon shall see and shall fear; and Gaza, and she shall be greatly pained, and Ekron; for her confidence was ashamed; and the king perished from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
{9:6} And a foreigner dwelt in Ashdod, and I cut off the pride of the rovers.
{9:7} And I took away his bloods from his mouth, and his abominable things from between his teeth: and being left he also to our God, and he was a thousand in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.
{9:8} And I encamped at my house a garrison from him passing by, and from him turning back: and he driving shall no more pass through against them: for now I saw with mine eyes.
{9:9} Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; make a loud noise, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy king shall come to thee: just, and saving; he is humble and riding upon an ass, and upon an ass's colt the son of asses.
{9:10} And I cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war was cut off: and he spake peace to the nations: and his dominion from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the end of the earth.
{9:11} Also thou by the blood of thy covenant I sent forth thy bound ones from the pit no water in it.
{9:12} Turn back to the fortress, ye captives of hope: also announcing this day I will turn back double to thee;
{9:13} For I tread out Judah to me, I filled the bow with Ephraim, and I raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and I set thee as the sword of the strong one.
{9:14} And Jehovah will be seen upon them, and his arrow shall go forth as lightning: and the Lord Jehovah will strike upon the trumpet, and he went with tempests of the south.
{9:15} Jehovah of armies shall protect over them; and they devoured and subdued with the stones of the sling; and they drank, they made a noise as from wine; and they filled as the vase, as the corners of the altar.
{9:16} And Jehovah their God saved them in that day as the sheep of his people: for the stones of consecration, lifting themselves up in his land.
{9:17} For what his good, and what his beauty! Grain shall cause the young men to increase, and new wine the virgins.
{10:1} Ask ye from Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain; Jehovah made lightnings, and he will give rain of heavy showers to them, to each the green herb in the field.
{10:2} For the family gods spake vanity, and the diviners saw falsehood, and they will speak dreams of falsehood they will comfort in vain: for this, they removed as a flock, they were afflicted for there was no shepherd.
{10:3} Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I will review upon the he goats: for Jehovah of armies reviewed upon his flock the house of Judah, as the house of his strength in the war.
{10:4} From him the chief, from him the nail, from him the bow of war, from him came forth every tyrant together.
{10:5} And they were as the strong treading down in the mud of the streets in the battle: and they waged war, for Jehovah was with them, and they riding horses were ashamed.
{10:6} And I strengthened the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I turned them back for I compassionated them, and they were as if I cast them not off: for I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them.
{10:7} And they were as the strong one of Ephraim, and their heart rejoiced as from wine: and their sons shall see, and rejoice; their heart shall exult in Jehovah.
{10:8} I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I redeemed them: and they multiplied as they multiplied.
{10:9} And I will sow them among the peoples, and in distant places shall they remember me: and they lived with their sons, and turned back.
{10:10} And I turned them back from the hind of Egypt, and from Assur will I gather them, and to the land of Gilead and Lebanon will I bring them; and it shall not be found for them.
{10:11} And he passed through the sea of straits, and he struck the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the river dried up; and the pride of Assur was brought down, and the rod of Egypt shall depart.
{10:12} And I strengthened them in Jehovah; and in his name shall they go about, says Jehovah.
{11:1} Open the doors, O Lebanon, and fire shall devour among thy cedars.
{11:2} Wail, O cypress, for the cedar fell; for the powerful ones were destroyed: wail, ye oaks of Bashan, for the forest of the vintage went down.
{11:3} A voice of wailing of the shepherds, for their greatness was destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions, for the pride of Jordan was destroyed.
{11:4} Thus said Jehovah my God: Feed the flock of slaughter;
{11:5} Which they possessing them will slaughter them, and they will not be punished: and they selling them will say, Blessed be Jehovah; and I shall be rich: and their shepherds had not pity upon them.
{11:6} For I will no more have pity upon the inhabitants of the land, says Jehovah: and behold, the men to be found each in the hand of his neighbor, and in the hand of his king: and they beat the land, and I will not deliver from their hand.
{11:7} And I will feed the flock of slaughter for you, and the poor of the sheep: And I will take to me two rods; to the one I called Beauty, and to the one, I called Cords; and I will feed the sheep.
{11:8} And I will conceal three shepherds in one month; and my soul will be shortened for them, and also their soul loathed for me.
{11:9} And saying, I will not feed you: the dying shall die, and the concealed shall be concealed; and they being left shall eat each the flesh of her neighbor.
{11:10} And I will take my rod Beauty, and I will cut it off, to break my covenant which I cut out with all the peoples.
{11:11} And it shall be broken in that day: and the poor of the flock watching me knew that it was the word of Jehovah.
{11:12} And saying to them, If good in your eyes, give ye my hire; and if not, desist. And they will weigh my hire, thirty of silver.
{11:13} And Jehovah will say to me, Cast it to the potter: a splendor of price which I was prized of them. And I shall take the thirty of silver and cast it in the house of Jehovah, to the potter.
{11:14} And I shall cut off my second rod, Cords, to break the brotherhood between Judah and between Israel.
{11:15} And Jehovah will say to me, Yet take to thee the vessels of a foolish shepherd.
{11:16} For behold, I raise up a shepherd in the land, he shall not review those being concealed; the youth he shall not seek, and he shall not heal the broken, and he shall not nourish the standing firmly: and he shall eat the flesh of the fading, and he shall break their hoofs.
{11:17} Wo! to the empty shepherd forsaking the sheep; the sword upon his arm, and upon his right eye: and his arm being dried up, shall be dried up, and his right eye being dim, shall be dim.
{12:1} The Lifting up of the word of Jehovah for Israel, says Jehovah, stretching forth the heavens and founding the earth, and forming the spirit of man in the midst of him.
{12:2} Behold, I set Jerusalem a dish of reeling to all peoples round about, and against Judah shall he be in the straitness against Jerusalem.
{12:3} And it was in that day I will set Jerusalem a stone of burden to all peoples: all loading her, being out; shall be cut; and all the nations of the earth were gathered together against her.
{12:4} In that day, says Jehovah, I will strike every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and upon the house of Judah I will open mine eyes, and every horse of the peoples I will strike with blindness.
{12:5} And the thousands of Judah said in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem strength to me in Jehovah of armies their God.
{12:6} In that day I will set the thousands of Judah as a fire-pan of fire among the woods, and as a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they devoured upon the right and upon the left all the peoples round about: and Jerusalem shall yet dwell in her place in Jerusalem.
{12:7} And Jehovah saved the tents of Judah first, so that the glorying of the house of David shall not be magnified, and the glorying of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, against Judah.
{12:8} In that day Jehovah shall protect about the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he being weak among them in that day was as David; and the house of David as God, as the messenger of Jehovah before them.
{12:9} And it was in that day I will seek to destroy all the nations coming against Jerusalem.
{12:10} And I poured out upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and supplications: and they looked to me whom they pierced, and they mourned for him as mourning for the only begotten, and being embittered for him as being embittered for the first-born.
{12:11} In that day the mourning shall be magnified as the mourning of Hadad-Rimmon in the valley of Megiddon.
{12:12} And the land mourned, families, families by themselves; the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of giving by itself, and their wives by themselves.
{12:13} The family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of hearing by itself, and their wives by themselves.
{12:14} All the families being left, families, families, by themselves, and their wives by themselves.
{13:1} In that day shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for putting away.
{13:2} And it was in that day, says Jehovah of armies, I will cut off the names of the images from the land, and they shall be remembered no more: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
{13:3} And it was if a man shall yet prophesy, and his father and his mother who begat him, said to him, Thou shalt not live, for thou spakest falsehood in the name of Jehovah: and his father and his mother begetting him thrust him through in his prophesying.
{13:4} And it was in that day the prophets shall be ashamed, each of his vision, in his prophesying; and they shall not put on a mantle of hair to speak lies:
{13:5} And saying, I am not a prophet; I a man working the land; for man sold me from my youth.
{13:6} And saying to him, What these wounds between thy hands? And he said, Which I was struck in the house of those loving me.
{13:7} O sword, be raised up against my shepherd, and against the man of my fellowship, says Jehovah of armies: strike the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered; and I turned back my hand upon the little ones.
{13:8} And it was in all the land, says Jehovah, two parts in it shall be cut off, they shall expire; and the third shall be left in it.
{13:9} And I brought the third through fire, and I purified them as purifying silver, and I tried them as trying gold: he shall call on my name and I will answer him: I said, He is my people; and he shall say, Jehovah my God.
{14:1} Behold, the day to Jehovah coming, and thy spoil was divided in the midst of thee.
{14:2} And I gathered all the nations against Jerusalem for war; and the city was taken, and the houses were plundered, and the women shall be ravished; and half the city shall go forth into captivity, and the people being left shall not be cut off from the city.
{14:3} And Jehovah went forth and waged war with these nations as the day of his warring in the day of encounter.
{14:4} And his feet stood in that day upon the mount of Olives which is upon the face of Jerusalem from the east; and the mount of Olives was cleft asunder from its half from the sunrising and the sea, and a very great valley; and half of the mountain removed to the north, and its half to the south.
{14:5} And ye fled to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to the side, and ye fled as ye fled from the face of the shaking in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah: and Jehovah my God came, all the holy ones with thee.
{14:6} And it was in that day the light shall not be; the splendors shall be drawn in:
{14:7} And it was one day it shall be known to Jehovah, not day, and not night: and it was at the time of evening it shall be light.
{14:8} And it was in that day living waters went forth from Jerusalem: half of them to the former sea, and half of them to the last sea: in summer and in autumn shall it be.
{14:9} And Jehovah was for king over all the earth: in that day Jehovah shall be one, and his name one.
{14:10} He shall surround all the land as the desert from the hill to the pomegranate south of Jerusalem: and it was high, and she dwelt in her place from the gate of Benjamin even to the place of the first gate, even to the gate of the corner, and the tower of Hananeel even to the wine-presses of the king.
{14:11} And they shall dwell in her and destruction shall be no more: and Jerusalem shall be confidently dwelt in.
{14:12} And this shall be the smiting which Jehovah will smite all the peoples who made war upon Jerusalem; and he caused his flesh to pine away, and he stood upon his feet, and his eyes shall pine away in their holes, and his tongue shall pine away in their mouth.
{14:13} And it was in that day there shall be great consternation of Jehovah among them; and they laid hold each upon the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall come up upon the hand of his neighbor.
{14:14} And also Judah shall wage war in Jerusalem; and he gathered the strength of all the nations round about, gold and silver and garments to an exceeding multitude.
{14:15} And thus shall be the smiting of the horse, the mule, the camel, and the ass, and all the cattle which shall be in those camps, as this smiting.
{14:16} And every one being left of all the nations coming against Jerusalem, and they went up from year to year to worship to the king, Jehovah of armies, to keep a festival, the festival of booths.
{14:17} And it was who will not come up of the families of the earth to Jerusalem to worship to the king, Jehovah of armies, and upon them shall not be rain.
{14:18} And if the family of Egypt shall not go up, and it not coming, and not upon them there shall be the smiting which Jehovah shall smite the nations which will not come up to keep the festival, the festival of booths.
{14:19} This shall be the sin of Egypt, and the sin of all the nations which will not come up to keep the festival, the festival of booths.
{14:20} In that day shall be upon the bells of the horse, Holiness to Jehovah; and it was the pots in the house of Jehovah as vases before the face of the altar.
{14:21} And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah was holiness to Jehovah of armies: and all sacrificing came and took of them, and boiled in them: and the Canaanite shall be no more in the house of Jehovah in that day.
