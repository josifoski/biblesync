{1:1} The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.
{1:2} Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob: and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;
{1:3} And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
{1:4} And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;
{1:5} And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Rath; and Obed begat Jesse;
{1:6} And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her of Urias.
{1:7} And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
{1:8} And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;
{1:9} And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz; begat Ezekias;
{1:10} And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;
{1:11} And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren upon the transferring of Babylon.
{1:12} And after the transferring of Babylon Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;
{1:13} And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
{1:14} And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim beget Elind;
{1:15} And Elind begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
{1:16} And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, being called Christ, the anointed.
{1:17} Therefore all the generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations; and from David to the transferring of Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the transferring of Babylon to Christ, fourteen generations.
{1:18} And the generation of Jesus Christ was thus: for Mary his mother having been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child by the Holy Ghost.
{1:19} And Joseph her husband being just, and not willing to expose her to disgrace, wished to let her go in secret.
{1:20} And reflecting upon these things, behold a messenger of the Lord appeared to him saying, Joseph, thou son of David, thou shouldest not fear to take to thyself Mary thy wife: for that begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.
{1:21} And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins,
{1:22} And the whole of this has been that it might be completed having been spoken by the prophet, saying,
{1:23} Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us.
{1:24} And Joseph having awaked from sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord commanded him:
{1:25} And he took to himself his wife, and knew her not till she brought forth her first born son: and be called his name Jesus.
{2:1} And Jesus born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold the magi from the sunrisings arrived in Jerusalem, saying:
{2:2} Where is he born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the sunrising, and have come to worship him.
{2:3} And Herod the king having heard, was stirred up, and all Jerusalem with him.
{2:4} And assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where Christ should be born.
{2:5} And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus has it been written by the prophet:
{2:6} And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, by no means art thou least among the leaders of Judah for out of thee shall come forth the leader, who shall feed my people.
{2:7} Then Herod having secretly called for the magi, searched thoroughly from them the time of the star appearing.
{2:8} And having sent them to Bethlehem, he said, Having gone, examine thoroughly concerning the child; and when ye should find, announce ye to me, so that I also, having gone, will worship him.
{2:9} And they having heard the king went forth; and, behold the star they saw in the sunrising, it led before them, till having come, it stood above where the young child was.
{2:10} And seeing the star, they rejoiced with great joy exceedingly.
{2:11} And having come into the house, they found the young child with Mary his mother, and having fallen, they worshipped him; and having opened their treasures they brought forward to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
{2:12} And having received intimation of the divine will in a dream not to turn back to Herod, by another way they went back to their own country.
{2:13} And they, having gone back, lo, the messenger of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph, saying, Having risen, take to thyself the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt, and be there till I speak to thee; for Herod is about to seek the young child to destroy him.
{2:14} And having risen, he took to himself the young child and his mother by night, and turned back in Egypt:
{2:15} And was there till the death of Herod: that it might be completed having been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
{2:16} Then Herod, seeing he was deluded by the magi, was very angry, and having sent, destroyed all the children which in Bethlehem, and in all its bounds, from two years and under, according to the time he examined thoroughly of the magi.
{2:17} Then was completed that spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
{2:18} A voice was heard in Rama, wailing, and weeping, and much lamentation; Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, for they are not.
{2:19} And Herod having died, behold a messenger of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,
{2:20} Having risen, take to thyself the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they seeking the soul of the young child have died.
{2:21} And having risen, he took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
{2:22} And having heard that Archelaus reigned over Judea, instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go there; and having received intimation of the divine will in a dream, he turned back into the parts of Galilee.
{2:23} And having come, he dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be completed spoken by the prophets, That he shall be called a Nazarite.
{3:1} In these days John the Baptist is present, proclaiming in the desert of Judea;
{3:2} And saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.
{3:3} For this is he spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, A voice of him crying in the desert, Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.
{3:4} And this John had his garment from camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
{3:5} Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all round about Jordan;
{3:6} And they were immersed in Jordan by him, acknowledging their sins.
{3:7} And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has indicated to you to flee from the wrath about to come?
{3:8} Do ye therefore fruit worthy of repentance.
{3:9} And think not to say in yourselves we have Abraham a father; for I say to you, that God can of these stones raise up children to Abraham.
{3:10} And now also the axe lies at the root of the trees; therefore every one not making good fruit is cut off and cast into fire.
{3:11} I truly immerse you in water to repentance; but he coming after me is stronger than I, whose shoes I am not fit to lift up; he shall immerse in the Holy Spirit, and fire.
{3:12} Whose winnowing fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and gather his wheat into the store; but he will burn down the chaff in inextinguishable fire.
{3:13} Then Jesus approaches from Galilee to Jordan, to John, to be immersed by him.
{3:14} And John hindered him, saying, I have need to be immersed by thee, and dost thou come to me?
{3:15} And Jesus having answered said to him, Permit now; for so it is suitable for us to complete all justice: then he permitted him.
{3:16} And Jesus, having been immersed, went up straight from the water, and, behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him.
{3:17} And behold a voice from the heavens, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son, in whom I was contented.
{4:1} Then was Jesus led up by the Spirit into the desert to be tried by the devil.
{4:2} And having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry.
{4:3} And the tempter having come to him, said, If thou art the Son of God, say that these stones should become bread.
{4:4} And he having answered, said, It has been written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word going forth through the mouth of God.
{4:5} Then the devil takes him into the holy city, and sets him upon the small wing of the temple;
{4:6} And says to him, If thou art the Son of God cast thyself down; for it has been written, That to his messengers he will command concerning thee; and in the hands shall they lift thee up, lest that perhaps thou strike thy foot against a stone.
{4:7} Jesus said to him, Again has it been written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
{4:8} Again, the devil takes him into a very high mount, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory;
{4:9} And he says to him, All these will I give to thee, if, falling down, thou wouldst worship me.
{4:10} Then says Jesus to him, Retire, Satan; for it has been written, The Lord thy God shalt thou worship, and him alone shalt thou serve.
{4:11} Then the devil lets him go, and behold, the messengers came up, and they served him.
{4:12} And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up, went back into Galilee.
{4:13} And having left Nazareth behind, having come, he dwelt in Capernaum, near the sea, in the boundaries of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
{4:14} That it might be completed having been spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying,
{4:15} The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, the way of the sea beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations:
{4:16} The people sitting in darkness saw a great light; and to them sitting in the room and shadow of death, light has sprung up to them.
{4:17} From then Jesus began to proclaim, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.
{4:18} And Jesus, walking about by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon being called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a sweep-net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
{4:19} And he says to them, Come after me, and I will make you the fishermen of men.
{4:20} And they instantly having let go their nets, followed him.
{4:21} And having proceeded thence, he saw other two brethren, James him of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the ship with Zebedee their father, adjusting their nets; and he called them.
{4:22} And they having instantly let go the ship and their father, followed him.
{4:23} And Jesus went about the whole of Galilee, teaching in their assemblies, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing disease, and every weakness in the people.
{4:24} And a report went forth of him into the whole of Syria: and they brought to him all those having injuries, being oppressed by various diseases, and trials, and being under the influence of a demon, and being lunatics, and paralytics, and he cured them.
{4:25} And many crowds followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond Jordan.
{5:1} And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain; and he having sat down, his disciples came to him.
{5:2} And having opened his mouth, he taught them, saying,
{5:3} Happy the poor in spirit: for their's is the kingdom of the heavens.
{5:4} Happy they suffering: for they shall be comforted.
{5:5} Happy the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
{5:6} Happy they hungering and thirsting for Justice: for they shall be filled.
{5:7} Happy the compassionate: for they shall be commiserated.
{5:8} Happy the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
{5:9} Happy they making peace: for they shall be called sons of God.
{5:10} Happy they driven out for justice: for their's is the kingdom of the heavens.
{5:11} Happy are ye, when they shall upbraid you, and drive you out, and say every evil word against you, lying, for my sake.
{5:12} Rejoice and be transported with joy; for much your reward in the heavens for so they drove out the prophets which before you.
{5:13} Ye are the salt of the earth: and if the salt be rendered insipid, with what shall it be salted? it is yet strong for nothing, except to be cast without, and to be trodden under foot of men.
{5:14} Ye are the light of the world. A city cannot be hid, set on a mountain.
{5:15} Neither do they burn a light, and set it under a basket, but upon a chandelier: and it shines to all in the house.
{5:16} So let your light shine before men, that they see your good works, and praise your Father, him in the heavens.
{5:17} Think not that I have come to abolish the law, or the prophets: for I have come not abolish, but to complete.
{5:18} For verily I say to you, Till heaven pass away, and earth, one iota, or one mark, should not pass away from the law, till all should be.
{5:19} Whoever therefore, should loose one of the least of these commands, and so teach men, he shall be called least in the kingdom of the heavens: but whoever should do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.
{5:20} For I say to you, That except your justice abound more than the scribes and Pharisees, ye should not come into the kingdom of the heavens.
{5:21} Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not kill: and whoever should kill shall be subject to judgment:
{5:22} But I say to you, That every one becoming angry with his brother, shall be subject to judgment: and whoever should say to his brother, Raca, should be, subject to the council: and whoever should say, O foolish, shall be subject to a hell of fire.
{5:23} If therefore, thou bring thy gift upon the altar, and there thou remember that thy brother has anything against thee,
{5:24} Let go there thy gift, before the altar, and retire; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then, having come, bring thy gift.
{5:25} Be kindly disposed to thy opponent quickly, while thou art in the way with him, lest thy opponent should deliver thee to the judge, and the judge should deliver thee to the assistant, and thou be cast into prison.
{5:26} Verily I say to thee, Thou shouldst not come out thence, even till, thou shouldst give back the last fourth.
{5:27} Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
{5:28} But I say to you, That every one seeing a woman, to eagerly desire her, has already committed adultery with her, in his heart.
{5:29} And if thine eye give thee cause of offence, take it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members be destroyed, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.
{5:30} And if thy right hand give thee cause of offence, cut it off, and cast from thee; for it is profitable to thee, that one of thy members should be destroyed; and not thy whole body should be cast into hell.
{5:31} And it was said, That whosoever should loose his wife, let him give her a repudiation.
{5:32} But I say to you, That whosoever shall let go his wife except for the reason of adultery, makes her to commit adultery; and whosoever should marry her having been loosed, commits adultery.
{5:33} Again, ye have heard, that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not swear a false oath, and thou shalt return to the Lord thine oaths.
{5:34} But I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven, it is the throne of God:
{5:35} Neither by the earth; for it is the footstool of his feet: neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great kings.
{5:36} Neither shouldst thou swear by thy head, for thou cant not make one hair white or black.
{5:37} But let your word be Yea, yea, and No, no: but that above this is of evil.
{5:38} Ye have heard, that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
{5:39} But I say to you, not to resist evil: but whosoever shall smite thee with a rod upon thy right cheek, turn to him also the other.
{5:40} And to him wishing to be judged with thee, and to take thy coat, let go to him also thy garment.
{5:41} And whoever shall compel thee to carry dispatches one mile, go forward with him two.
{5:42} To him asking thee, give thou, and him wishing to borrow from thee, thou shouldst not turn away.
{5:43} Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy.
{5:44} But I say to you, Love your enemies, praise them cursing you, do well to them hating you, and pray for them threatening you, and driving you out.
{5:45} So that ye might be sons of your Father, which in the heavens: for he makes his sun rise upon evil and good, and rains on the just and unjust.
{5:46} For if ye love them loving you, what reward have you? do not also the tax collectors the same?
{5:47} And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye above ordinary? and do not the tax collectors the same?
{5:48} Therefore, be ye perfected, as your Father which is in the heavens is perfected.
{6:1} Attend ye not to do your justice before men, to be seen to them; and if otherwise ye have no reward from your Father which in the heavens.
{6:2} When therefore thou doest alms, thou shouldst not sound the trumpet before thee, as hypocrites do in the assemblies, and in the streets, that they might be praised by men. Verily I say to you, They have their reward.
{6:3} But thou doing alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right does:
{6:4} That thine alms might be in secret; and thy Father, who seeing in secret, shall give back to thee openly.
{6:5} And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites; for they love in the assemblies, and in the corners of the broad ways to stand praying, so that they might appear to men. Verily I say to you, that they have their reward.
{6:6} But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy store-house, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father which in secret; and thy Father who seeing in secret shall give back to thee openly.
{6:7} And praying, talk ye not vainly as the nations; for they think that by their profaneness of speech they shall be listened to.
{6:8} Therefore make not yourselves like them: for your Father knows of what things ye have need before ye ask him.
{6:9} Therefore so do ye pray: Our Father which in the heavens, Let thy name be declared holy.
{6:10} Let thy kingdom come. Let thy will be as in heaven also upon the earth.
{6:11} Give us this day our bread sufficient for sustenance.
{6:12} And let go to us our debts, as we let go to our debtors.
{6:13} And thou shouldst not lead us into temptation, but deliver thou us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.
{6:14} For if ye let go to men their faults, your Father which in the heavens will also let go to you.
{6:15} But if ye should not let go to men their faults, neither will your Father let go your faults.
{6:16} And when ye fast, be not, as hypocrites, of gloomy aspect: for they conceal their faces that they might appear to men fasting. Verily I say to you, That they have their reward.
{6:17} And thou fasting, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;
{6:18} That thou mightest not appear to men fasting, but to thy Father which in secret; and thy Father which in secret, will give back to thee openly.
{6:19} Treasure not up to you treasures upon earth, where moth and gnawing destroy, and thieves dig through and steal:
{6:20} But treasure to you treasures in heaven, where neither moth, nor gnawing destroy; and where thieves dig not through, nor steal.
{6:21} For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
{6:22} The light of the body is the eye; if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be light.
{6:23} But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be dark. If therefore the light which in thee is darkness, how much the darkness.
{6:24} None can serve two lords: for either he will hate one and love the other; or hold firmly to one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
{6:25} For this I say to you, Be not anxious about your soul, what ye eat, and what ye drink; nor about your body, what ye put on. Is not the soul more than food, and the body than dress?
{6:26} Look ye upon the fowls of heaven; for they neither sow, nor reap, nor collect into stores; and your heavenly Father nourishes them. Do ye not rather differ from them.
{6:27} Which of you, being anxious, can add one cubit to his size?
{6:28} And about dress, why are ye anxious? Consider the white lilies of the field, how they grow; they are not wearied, neither do they spin:
{6:29} And I say to you, that neither Solomon in all his glory was surrounded as one of these.
{6:30} And if the grass of the field, being this day, and to morrow cast into the furnace, God so clothes much rather you, ye of little faith!
{6:31} Therefore be ye not anxious, saying: What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, What shall we put round us?
{6:32} For all these the nations seek for; for your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these.
{6:33} But seek first the kingdom of God and his justice, and all these shall be added to you.
{6:34} Therefore should ye not be anxious about the morrow: for the morrow shall be anxious about the things of itself. Sufficient for the day its evil.
{7:1} Judge not, that ye be not judged.
{7:2} For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye measure, it shall be repaid to you.
{7:3} And why seest thou the mote which is in thy brother's eye, and the beam in thine eye thou observest not?
{7:4} Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let go I will cast out the mote from thine eye: and behold a beam in thine eye.
{7:5} Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam from thine eye, and thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote from thy brother's eye.
{7:6} Ye should not give the holy thing to dogs neither should ye cast your pearls before swine, lest they tread them down with their feet, and having turned, should rend you.
{7:7} Ask, and it shall be given you. Seek, and ye shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened to you.
{7:8} For everyone asking, receives and he seeking, finds; and to him knocking shall be opened.
{7:9} Or what man is of you, which, if his son ask bread, he will not give him a stone?
{7:10} And if he ask a fish, he will not give him a serpent?
{7:11} If ye, therefore, being evil, know to give good gifts to your children how much more will your Father which is in the heavens give good things to those asking him?
{7:12} Therefore all whatever ye would that men should do to you, so also do ye to them; for this is the law and the prophets.
{7:13} Enter ye in through the strait gate, for broad the gate and spacious the way leading to destruction, and many are they coming in through it.
{7:14} For strait the gate and afflicted the way leading into life, and few are they finding it.
{7:15} And hold from false prophets which come in to you in sheep's dresses, but within they are rapacious wolves.
{7:16} By their fruits shall ye know them. Far from it, do they gather grapes from thorns, or figs from caltrops.
{7:17} So every good tree makes good fruits; but the rotten tree makes evil fruits.
{7:18} A good tree cannot make evil fruits, nor a rotten tree make good fruits.
{7:19} Every tree not making good fruit is cut off, and cast into fire.
{7:20} Wherefore from their fruits shall ye know them.
{7:21} Not every one saying to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens; but he doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens.
{7:22} Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have we cast out evil spirits, and in thy name done many powers?
{7:23} And then shall I confess to them that I never knew you. Go away from me, ye working iniquity.
{7:24} Therefore, every one which hears these my words and does them, I will liken him to a discerning man which built his house upon the rock.
{7:25} And the rain descended, and rivers came, and winds blew, and fell upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon the rock.
{7:26} And every one hearing these my words and doing them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, which built his house upon sand.
{7:27} And the rain descended, and rivers came, and winds blew and struck upon that house, and it fell, and great was its fall.
{7:28} And it was when Jesus finished these words, the crowds were struck with amazement at his teaching:
{7:29} For he was teaching them as having power, and not as the scribes.
{8:1} And having come down from the mountain, great crowds followed him.
{8:2} And, behold, a leper, having come, worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt thou canst cleanse me.
{8:3} And having stretched forth the hand, Jesus touched him, saying, I will; be thou cleansed and instantly his leprosy was cleansed.
{8:4} And Jesus says to him, See thou tell no one; but retire, show thyself to the priest, and bring near the gift which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
{8:5} And Jesus having entered into Capernaum, a captain of a hundred came to him, and beseeching him,
{8:6} And saying, Lord, my servant has been laid up in the house a paralytic, being grievously tormented.
{8:7} And Jesus says to him, I, having come, will cure him.
{8:8} And the captain of a hundred having answered said, Lord, I am not fit that thou shouldest enter in under my roof: but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed.
{8:9} For I also am a man under power, having soldiers under me: and I say to this, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does.
{8:10} And Jesus having heard, admired, and said to those following; Verily I say to you, not in Israel have I found such faith.
{8:11} And I say to you, That many shall come from the sunrising and the descents, and shall recline with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens.
{8:12} But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness; weeping shall be there, and gnashing of teeth.
{8:13} And Jesus said to the captain of a hundred, Retire; as thou hast believed, let it be to thee. And his servant was healed in that hour.
{8:14} And Jesus, having come into Peter's house, saw his mother-in-law having been laid up, and affected with fever.
{8:15} And he touched her hand, and the fever let her go: and she arose, and served them.
{8:16} And evening being come, they brought him many possessed with evil spirits: and he east out the spirits by the word, and cured all having evils:
{8:17} So that that spoken by Esaias the prophet was completed, saying. He took our weakness, and lifted up diseases.
{8:18} And Jesus seeing many crowds about him, encouraged to go away beyond.
{8:19} And one scribe, coming near, said to him, Teacher, I will follow thee wherever thou goest.
{8:20} And Jesus says to him, The foxes have dens, and the fowls of heaven occupy nests; but the Son of man has not where he might recline the head.
{8:21} And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, permit me first to go and inter my father.
{8:22} But Jesus said to him, Follow me; and let the dead inter the dead.
{8:23} And he having gone into a ship, his disciples followed him.
{8:24} And, behold, a great shaking was in the sea, so that the ship was covered by the waves: and be slept.
{8:25} And his disciples, having come near, awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we are lost.
{8:26} And he says to them, Why are ye timorous, ye of little faith? Then having risen, he censured the winds and sea; and there was a great calm.
{8:27} And the men admired, saying, of what race is this for the winds and the sea listen to him.
{8:28} And he having come beyond the country of the Gergesenes, two possessed with evil spirits, coming out of the tombs, met him, very rough, so that not any could pass by that way.
{8:29} And, behold, they cried out, saying, What to us and thee, Jesus, Son of God? hast thou come here to torture us before the time.
{8:30} And far off from them was a herd of many swine grazing.
{8:31} And the evil spirits besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine.
{8:32} And he said to them, Retire. And having gone, they went away into the herd of swine: and, behold, all the herd of swine rushed down the precipice into the sea, and died in the water.
{8:33} And they feeding fled; and having come into the city, they announced all things, and those of the possessed with evil spirits.
{8:34} And, behold, all the city came forth to the meeting to Jesus: and seeing him, they besought that he would go away from their boundaries.
{9:1} And having entered into a ship, he passed over and came into his own city.
{9:2} And, behold, they brought him a paralytic, laid upon a bed; and Jesus seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Take courage, child thy sins are let go to thee.
{9:3} And behold, certain of the scribes said in themselves, This defames.
{9:4} And Jesus seeing their reflections, said, Why reflect ye within your hearts?
{9:5} For why is it easier to say, Sins are let go to thee; or say, Arise and walk?
{9:6} But that ye might know that the Son of man has power upon earth to let go sins, (then he says to the paralytic), Having risen, take up thy bed and retire to thy house.
{9:7} And having risen, he went away into his house.
{9:8} And the crowds, seeing, admired, and praised God, giving such power to men.
{9:9} And Jesus, passing away from thence, saw a man sitting by the custom-house, being called Matthew, and he says to him, Follow me; and having risen he followed him.
{9:10} And it was he sitting at table in the house, and behold, many tax collectors and sinful, having come, sat at table with Jesus and his disciples.
{9:11} And the Pharisees, seeing, said to his disciples, Wherefore does your teacher eat with tax collectors and the sinful?
{9:12} And Jesus having heard, said to them, They being strong have no need of a physician, but they having evils.
{9:13} And having gone, learn what is this, I wish mercy, and not sacrifice: for I came not to call the just, but the sinful to repentance.
{9:14} Then came to him the disciples of John; saying, Wherefore do we and the Pharisees fast much, and thy disciples fast not?
{9:15} And Jesus said to them, The sons of the nuptial chamber cannot mourn inasmuch as the bridegroom is with them; but the days shall come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast.
{9:16} And no one puts on a cover of uncombed fragment upon an old garment, for its filling takes away from the garment, and the division is Worse.
{9:17} Neither do they cast new wine into old wine-skins: but if otherwise, the wine-skins burst, and the wine is poured out, and the wine-skins are destroyed; but they cast new wine into new wine-skins, and they are both preserved.
{9:18} He speaking these things to them, behold, a ruler, having come, worshipped him, saying; That my daughter has just now died: but having come, put thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
{9:19} And Jesus having risen, followed him: also his disciples.
{9:20} And behold, a woman discharging blood twelve years, having come near behind, touched the hem of his garment:
{9:21} For she said in herself, If I should only touch the hem of his garment, I shall be saved.
{9:22} And Jesus having turned round, and seeing her, said, Take courage, daughter; thy faith has saved thee. And the woman was saved from that hour.
{9:23} And Jesus having come into the ruler's house, and seeing the flute players and the crowd making an uproar,
{9:24} He says to them, Give way; for the girl is not dead but sleeps; and they mocked him.
{9:25} But when the crowd was driven forth, having entered, he seized her hand, and the little girl was awakened.
{9:26} And this report went forth into that whole land.
{9:27} And Jesus passing from thence, two blind ones followed him, crying out and saying, Commiserate us, O son of David.
{9:28} And having come into the house, the blind came to him: and Jesus says to them, Believe ye that I can do this? They say to him, Yes, Lord.
{9:29} Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it to you.
{9:30} And their eyes were opened; and Jesus threatened them, saying, See, let none know.
{9:31} But they, having gone out, divulged it in that, whole land.
{9:32} And they having gone, behold they brought to him a man dumb, possessed with an evil spirit.
{9:33} And the demon being cast out, the dumb, spake, and the crowd admired, saying, It was never so brought to light in Israel.
{9:34} But the Pharisees said, By the chief of demons he casts out demons.
{9:35} And Jesus went about all the cities and towns, teaching in their assemblies, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every disease and every weakness in the people.
{9:36} And having seen the crowds, he felt compassion for them, for they were relaxed and dispersed, as sheep not having a shepherd.
{9:37} Then he says to his disciples, Truly the harvest much, but the laborers few.
{9:38} Implore therefore the Lord of the harvest, so that he might draw forth laborers into his harvest.
{10:1} And having called his twelve disciples, he gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to cure every disease and every weakness.
{10:2} And the names of the twelve sent are these: first, Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James, he of Zebedee and John his brother;
{10:3} Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James, he of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, he surnamed Thaddeus;
{10:4} Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, he also having delivered him up.
{10:5} These twelve Jesus sent, having announced to them, saying, Go not in the way of the nations, and into the city of the Samaritans enter ye not.
{10:6} But rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
{10:7} And going, proclaim, saying, That the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.
{10:8} Cure the sick, cleanse the leprous, rouse the dead, cast out demons; as a gift ye have received, as a gift give.
{10:9} Provide not gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses;
{10:10} Nor wallet for the way, nor two coats, nor shoes, nor rod: for the laborer is worthy of his food.
{10:11} And to whatever city or town ye should come in, examine who in it is worthy; and there remain till ye go forth.
{10:12} And entering into a house, do ye greet it.
{10:13} And if the house should be worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you.
{10:14} And whoever should not receive you, nor hear your words, coming out of that house or that city, shake off the cloud of the dust of your feet.
{10:15} Verily I say to you, it shall be more supportable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
{10:16} Behold I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves; be ye therefore discerning as serpents, and pure as doves.
{10:17} And hold ye from men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their assemblies will they scourge you.
{10:18} And ye shalt be brought before leaders and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.
{10:19} And when they deliver you up, have no care how or what ye should speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak.
{10:20} For ye yourselves are not speaking, but the spirit of your father speaking in you.
{10:21} And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and father child: and children shall rise up in revolt against parents, and kill them.
{10:22} And ye shall be hated by all for my name: and he having remained to the end shall be saved.
{10:23} And when they drive you out in this city, flee ye to another; for verily I say to you, Ye shall not finish the cities of Israel till the Son of man come.
{10:24} The disciple is not above the teacher, nor the servant above his lord.
{10:25} Sufficient to the disciple that he be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzeboul, how much more those pertaining to his household?
{10:26} Therefore fear them not; for nothing has been covered, which shall not be revealed; and concealed, that shall not be known.
{10:27} What I say to you in darkness, speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the houses.
{10:28} And fear not from those killing the body, and not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him able to destroy also soul and body in hell.
{10:29} Are not two little sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall to the earth without your Father.
{10:30} And also the hairs of your head are all numbered.
{10:31} Fear not therefore; ye have the preeminence over many sparrows.
{10:32} Every one therefore who shall agree with me before men, I also will agree with him before my Father, him in the heavens.
{10:33} But whoever should deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father, him in the heavens.
{10:34} Think not that I came to cast peace upon earth; I came not to cast peace, but a sword.
{10:35} For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the bride against her mother-in-law.
{10:36} And a man's enemies, they pertaining to his household.
{10:37} He loving father or mother above me, is not worthy of me; and he loving son or daughter above me, is not worthy of me.
{10:38} And whoever takes not his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me.
{10:39} He finding his soul shall lose it; and he having lost his soul for my sake shall find it.
{10:40} He receiving you, receives me; and he receiving me, receives him sending me.
{10:41} He receiving a prophet in a prophet's name, shall receive a prophet's reward; and he receiving the just in the name of the just, shall take the reward of the just.
{10:42} And whoever should give to drink one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.
{11:1} And it was when Jesus finished ordering his twelve disciples, he went away from thence to teach and proclaim in all their cities.
{11:2} And John having heard in prison the works of Christ, having sent two of his disciples,
{11:3} He said to him, Art thou he coming, or should we look for another?
{11:4} And Jesus having answered said to them, Having gone, announce to John what ye hear and see:
{11:5} The blind receive sight, and the lame walk, the leprous are cleansed, and the deaf bear, the dead are roused, and the poor have good news announced.
{11:6} And happy is he who shall not give cause of offence in me.
{11:7} And these going forth, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, What went ye forth into the desert to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
{11:8} But what went ye out to see? A man clad in soft garments? but they having soft things are in king's houses.
{11:9} But what went ye out to see? A prophet? yes, I say to you, and more eminent than a prophet.
{11:10} For this is he for whom it was Written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
{11:11} Verily I say to you, in the begotten of women has there not risen a greater than John the Immerser; but the less in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.
{11:12} From the days of John the Immerser till now the kingdom of the heavens is achieved by force, and they committing violence seize it eagerly.
{11:13} For all the prophets, And the law prophesied till John.
{11:14} And if ye will receive, this is Elias he about to come.
{11:15} He having ears to hear, let him hear.
{11:16} To what shall I liken this generation I it is like little boys sitting in market-places, and calling to their companions,
{11:17} And saying, We played the flute to you, and ye moved not; we lamented to you and ye lamented not.
{11:18} For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has an evil spirit.
{11:19} The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man a glutton, and wine drinker, a friend of publicans and sinful; and wisdom has been justified from her children.
{11:20} Then began he to blame the cities in which were his greatest powers, because they repented not.
{11:21} Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if in Tyre and Sidon had been the powers being in you, long since had they repented in sackcloth and ashes.
{11:22} But I say to you, To Tyre and Sidon shall it be more supportable in the day of judgment, than to you.
{11:23} And thou, Capernaum, lifted up even to heaven, thou shalt he brought down to hades: for if in the people of Sodom had been the powers being in thee, they had remained till this day.
{11:24} But I say to you, That to the land of Sodom it shall be more supportable in the day of judgment, than to you.
{11:25} In that time Jesus having answered, said, I acknowledge to thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for thou hast hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to children.
{11:26} Yes, Father: for so was it benevolence before thee.
{11:27} All things were delivered to me by my Father; and none knows the Son, except the Father; nor knows any one the Father, except the Son, and to whom the Son will reveal.
{11:28} Come to me, all ye wearied and loaded, and I will cause you to rest.
{11:29} Lift up my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and humble in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls.
{11:30} For my yoke is useful, and my load is light.
{12:1} In that time Jesus went in the sabbaths through the standing corn and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears, end eat.
{12:2} And the Pharisees, seeing, said to him, Behold, thy disciples do what is not lawful to do in the sabbath.
{12:3} And he said to them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they with him;
{12:4} How he went into the house of God, and ate the loaves of setting up, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor those with him, but for the priests alone?
{12:5} Or have ye not read in the law, that in the sabbaths, the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are innocent?
{12:6} But I say to you, That he here is greater than the temple.
{12:7} And if ye knew what it is, I will mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the innocent.
{12:8} For the Lord of the sabbath is also the Son of man.
{12:9} And having passed from thence, he went into their assembly;
{12:10} And, behold, there was a man having the hand withered. And they asked him saying, Is it lawful to cure in the sabbaths? that they might expose him.
{12:11} And he said to them, Which of you shall be the man who shall have one sheep, and if this should fall into a pit in the sabbaths, will he not take hold of it, and raise it up?
{12:12} How much then does a man surpass a sheep? So that it is lawful to do well in the sabbaths.
{12:13} Then says he to the man, Stretch out thy hand; and he stretched it out; and it was restored, sound as the other.
{12:14} And the Pharisees took counsel against him, having gone out, that they might kill him.
{12:15} And Jesus having known, withdrew from thence; and many crowds followed him, and he cured them all;
{12:16} And he rebuked them that they should not make him known:
{12:17} So that that spoken by the prophet Esaias might be completed, saying,
{12:18} Behold my servant, which I have chosen: my dearly beloved, in whom my soul was contented; I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall proclaim judgment to the nations.
{12:19} He shall not contend, nor cry; nor shall any hear his voice in the streets.
{12:20} He shall not break a bruised reed, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he should draw forth judgment to victory.
{12:21} And in his name shall the nations hope.
{12:22} Then he possessed with a demon, blind, and dumb, was brought to him; and he cured him, so that the blind and dumb spake and saw also.
{12:23} And all the crowds were affected, and said, Is not this the son of David?
{12:24} But the Pharisees, having heard, said, He casts not out demons, but by Beelzebub, ruler of demons.
{12:25} And Jesus knowing their reflections, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.
{12:26} And if Satan casts out Satan, he was divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
{12:27} And I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast out? for this shall they be your judges.
{12:28} But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out demons, the kingdom of God has come before hand upon you.
{12:29} Or how can any one come into the house of the strong, and plunder his goods, except be first bind the strong? and then he will plunder his house.
{12:30} He not being with me is against me; and he not gathering with me; scatters.
{12:31} For this I say to you, All sin and blasphemy shall be let go to men; but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be let go to men.
{12:32} And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be remitted to him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be let go to him, neither in this time, nor that about to be.
{12:33} Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree rotten, and its fruit rotten; for the tree is known by its fruit.
{12:34} O generation of vipers! how can ye speak good things, being evil? for out of the abundance of the heart the month speaks.
{12:35} The good man, out of the good treasure of the heart, casts forth good things: and the evil man, out of the evil treasure, casts forth evil things.
{12:36} And I say to you, That every idle word which men speak, they shill return word for it in the day of judgment.
{12:37} For by thy words shalt thou be justified, and by thy words shalt thou be condemned.
{12:38} Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, Teacher, we wish to see a sign from thee.
{12:39} And he having answered, said to them, An evil generation and an adulteress seeks a sign; and no sign shall be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.
{12:40} For as Jonas was in the whale's belly three days and three nights; so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
{12:41} The Ninevite men shall rise up in judgment with this generation, and condemn it: for they repented at the proclamation of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas here.
{12:42} The queen of the South shall be raised up in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for she came from the end of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon here.
{12:43} And when the unclean spirit has gone out from a man, he passes through sterile places, seeking rest, and finds not.
{12:44} Then says he, I will return into my house, whence I came out; and having come, he finds vacant; having been swept, and put in order.
{12:45} Then he goes, and takes with himself seven other spirits, worse than he, and having come in, they dwell there: and the last things of that man are worse than the first. So also shall it be to this evil generation.
{12:46} And he yet speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.
{12:47} And a certain one said to him, Behold, thy mother, and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee.
{12:48} And he having answered, said to him speaking to him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
{12:49} And having stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
{12:50} For whoever should do the will of my Father, him in the heavens, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
{13:1} And in that day Jesus, having come out of the house, sat by the sea.
{13:2} And many crowds were assembled together to him; therefore having entered into the ship, he sat down, and all the crowd stood upon the sea-shore.
{13:3} And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, he, the sower, went forth to sow.
{13:4} And in his sowing some truly fell by the way, and the flying things came and swallowed them down.
{13:5} And others fell upon rocky places where it had not much earth, and quickly it sprang forth, for it had no depth of earth.
{13:6} And the sun having risen, it was parched up; and for the not having a root, it was dried up.
{13:7} And others fell among thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them.
{13:8} And others fell upon good earth and gave fruit, some truly a hundred, and some sixty, and some thirty.
{13:9} He having ears to hear let him hear.
{13:10} And the disciples having come near, said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?
{13:11} And having answered, he said to them, For to you it was given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it was not given.
{13:12} For whoever has shall be given to him, and he shall have in excess; and whoever has not, also what he has shall be taken away from him.
{13:13} For this I speak to them in parables: for seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
{13:14} And the prophecy of Esaias is filled up in them, saying, In hearing shall ye hear, and not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive.
{13:15} For the heart of this people has been thickened, and with their ears have they heard heavily, and their eyes have they closed; lest perhaps they should see with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and turn back, and I should heal them.
{13:16} But happy your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.
{13:17} For verily I say to you, that many prophets and just desired eagerly to see what ye see, and saw not; and to hear what ye hear, and heard not.
{13:18} Therefore hear ye the parable of him sowing.
{13:19} Every one hearing, and not understanding, the evil one comes, and carries off that sown in his heart. This is he having sown by the way.
{13:20} And he having sown upon rocky places, this is he hearing the word, and quickly with joy receiving it;
{13:21} And has no root in himself, but is for a time; and there being pressure or expulsion for the word, straightly is he offended.
{13:22} And he having sown among thorns, this is he hearing the word; and the care of this time, and the deceit of riches, choke the word, and it is unfruitful.
{13:23} But he having sown upon good earth is he hearing the word, and understanding; who indeed bears fruit, and who makes truly a hundred, and who sixty, and who thirty.
{13:24} Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens was made like a man sowing good seed in his field:
{13:25} And in men's sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat, and went away.
{13:26} And when the grass sprouted up and made fruit, then appeared the tares also.
{13:27} And the servants of the master of the house having come, said to him, Lord, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field whence therefore has it tares?
{13:28} And he said to them, A man, an enemy, has done this: and his servants said to him, Wilt thou therefore we, having departed, should gather them.
{13:29} And he said, No; lest gathering the tares, ye root up the wheat together with them.
{13:30} Suffer both to grow together till harvest; and in time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; and gather the wheat into my barn.
{13:31} Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a kernel of mustard, which a man taking, sowed in his field:
{13:32} Which truly is less than all seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than vegetables, and becomes a tree, so that the flying things of heaven come and lodge in its young shoots.
{13:33} Another parable spake he to them; The kingdom of the heavens is like to leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three measures of wheaten flour, till the whole was leavened.
{13:34} All these things spake Jesus in parables to the crowds; and without a parable spake he not to them.
{13:35} So that that spoken by the prophet might be filled up; saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will declare things having been hid from the foundation of the world.
{13:36} Then Jesus having dismissed the crowds, went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.
{13:37} And he having answered, said to them, He sowing the good seed is the Son of man:
{13:38} And the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one;
{13:39} And the enemy having sowed them is the devil; and the harvest is the end of time; and the reapers are the messengers.
{13:40} As therefore the tares are gathered together and burnt in fire; so shall it be in the end of this time.
{13:41} The Son of man shall send forth his messengers, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all scandals, and those doing iniquity;
{13:42} And they shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall there be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
{13:43} Then shall the just emit a brilliant light as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He having ears to hear, let him hear.
{13:44} Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like to a treasure hid in the field; which a man finding, concealed, and from his joy, he retires, and all things which he has he sells, and he purchases that field.
{13:45} Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like to a man, a wholesale merchant, seeking beautiful pearls:
{13:46} Who, finding one pearl of great value, having departed, he sold all things which he had, and purchased it.
{13:47} Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like to a large sweep-net, cast into the sea, and having gathered of every kind:
{13:48} Which when it was filled, having raised up upon the shore, and having set down, they gathered the good things into vessels, and the rotten things they cast without.
{13:49} So shall it be in the end of time; the messengers shall come forth, and separate the evil from the midst of the just,
{13:50} And they shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall there be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
{13:51} Jesus says to them, Have ye understood all these? They say to him, Yes, Lord.
{13:52} And he said to them, Therefore every scribe, having been a disciple in the kingdom of the heavens, is like to a man, master of a house, who casts out from his treasure new things and old.
{13:53} And it was when Jesus finished these parables, he removed thence.
{13:54} And having come into his native land, he taught them in their assembly, so that they were struck with amazement, and said, Whence to him this wisdom, and powers?
{13:55} Is not this the son of the carpenter? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
{13:56} And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then to him all these?
{13:57} And they were scandalized in him. And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not unhonoured, except in his native land, and in his house.
{13:58} And he did not many powers there, because of their unbelief.
{14:1} In that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report of Jesus,
{14:2} And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; be was aroused from the dead; and for this, powers are energetic in him.
{14:3} For Herod, having seized John, bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias, his brother Philip's wife:
{14:4} For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her:
{14:5} And wishing to kill him, he was afraid of the crowd, because they held John as a prophet.
{14:6} The festivities of Herod's birthday being celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.
{14:7} Wherefore, with an oath, he agreed to give her whatever she should ask.
{14:8} And having been urged on by her mother, Give me, she says, here upon a board, the head of John the Baptist.
{14:9} And the king was grieved: but for his oath, and those reclining together at the table, he ordered to be given.
{14:10} And having sent, he beheaded John in the prison.
{14:11} And his head was brought upon a board, and given to the girl, and she brought to her mother.
{14:12} And his disciples having come near, took away the body, and interred it; and having come, they announced to Jesus.
{14:13} And Jesus having heard, withdrew from thence into a desert place apart: and the crowds, having heard, followed him on foot from the cities.
{14:14} And Jesus having come, saw a great crowd: and he felt compassion for them, and he cured their sick.
{14:15} And being evening, his disciples came to him, saying, It is a desert place, and the time has passed already; loose the crowds, that, having gone into towns, they might purchase food for themselves.
{14:16} But Jesus said to them, They have no need to depart; give ye them to eat.
{14:17} And they say to him, We have not here but five loaves, and two fishes.
{14:18} And he said, Bring them here to me.
{14:19} And having encouraged the crowds to recline upon the grass, and having taken the five loaves, and two fishes, and having looked up to heaven, he praised; and having broken, gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.
{14:20} And they all ate, and were satisfied; and they took up the remaining of fragments, twelve baskets full.
{14:21} And they eating were five thousand men, besides women and children.
{14:22} And quickly Jesus constrained his disciples to go into the ship, and to go before him to the other side, till he should loose the crowds.
{14:23} And having loosed the crowds, he went up into a mount apart to pray: and being evening, he was there alone.
{14:24} And the ship was already in the midst of the sea, overcharged by waves: for the wind was contrary.
{14:25} And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them, walking upon the sea.
{14:26} And the disciples seeing him walking upon the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition; and they cried out for fear.
{14:27} And quickly Jesus spake to them, saying, Take courage; I am; be not afraid.
{14:28} And Peter having answered him, said, Lord, if thou art, encourage me to come upon the waters.
{14:29} And he said, Come. And Peter having gone down from the ship, walked upon the waters, to go to Jesus.
{14:30} And seeing the wind strong, he was afraid: and beginning to sink, he cried out, Lord, save me.
{14:31} And quickly Jesus, having stretched out the hand, laid hold of him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, for what didst thou doubt?
{14:32} And having gone into the ship, the wind ceased.
{14:33} And they in the ship, having come, worshipped him, saying, Thou art truly the Son of God.
{14:34} And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
{14:35} And the men of the place, having known him, sent into the whole country round about, and brought to him all those having evils:
{14:36} And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were saved from danger.
{15:1} Then came to Jesus from Jerusalem the scribes and Pharisees, saying,
{15:2} Wherefore do thy disciples pass by the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
{15:3} And he, having answered, said to them, Wherefore do ye also pass by the command of God by your tradition.
{15:4} For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, he calumniating father or mother, in death let him die.
{15:5} And ye say, Whoever should say to father or mother, A gift, whatever thou shouldest be profited by me;
{15:6} And should not honour his father or his mother. And ye have annulled the command of God by your tradition.
{15:7} Hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
{15:8} This people draw near me with their mouth, and honour me with their lips; but their heart keeps off far from me.
{15:9} But they worship me in vain, teaching doctrines the commands of men.
{15:10} And having called the crowd, he said to them, Hear ye, and understand.
{15:11} Not that coming into the mouth pollutes the man; but that going forth out of the mouth, this pollutes the man.
{15:12} Then his disciples having come near, said to him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees, having heard the word, were scandalized?
{15:13} And having answered, he said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up.
{15:14} Let them go: they are blind guides of the blind. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
{15:15} And Peter, having answered, said to him, Explain to us this parable.
{15:16} And Jesus said, Are ye also yet destitute of understanding?
{15:17} Do ye not yet understand, that everything going into the mouth proceeds to the belly, and is cast out in the privy?
{15:18} But the things going forth out of the mouth come from the heart, and these pollute the man.
{15:19} For from the heart come forth evil reflections, slaughters, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, defamations:
{15:20} These are the things polluting a man: but to eat with unwashed hands pollutes not a man.
{15:21} And Jesus, having gone forth from thence, withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.
{15:22} And, behold, a woman, a Canaanite, having come forth from those boundaries, cried out to him, saying, Pity me, Lord, son of David; my daughter is badly possessed with an evil spirit.
{15:23} And he answered her not a word. And his disciples, having come, asked him, saying, Loose her; for she cries out after us.
{15:24} And he, having answered, said, I was not sent except to the sheep having been lost, of the house of Israel.
{15:25} And she, having come, worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
{15:26} And he, having answered, said, It is not good to take the children's bread, and cast it to the little dogs.
{15:27} And she said, Yes, Lord; for the little dogs also eat from the crumbs falling from the table of their lord.
{15:28} Then Jesus, having answered, said to her, O woman, great thy faith: let it be to thee as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.
{15:29} And having passed from thence, Jesus came to the sea of Galilee; and having gone up into a mountain, he sat there.
{15:30} And many crowds came to him, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them at the feet of Jesus; and he cured them:
{15:31} So that the crowds wondered, seeing the dumb speaking, the maimed sound, the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they praised the God of Israel.
{15:32} And Jesus having called his disciples, said, I feel compassion for the crowd, for already they remain with me three days, and they have nothing they could eat: and I will not leave them fasting, lest they be relaxed in the way.
{15:33} And his disciples say to him, Whence to us, in a lonely place, so many loaves, to satisfy such a crowd?
{15:34} And he says to them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
{15:35} And he encouraged the crowd to recline upon the earth.
{15:36} And having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, having returned thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.
{15:37} And all ate, and were satisfied: and they took up that remaining of the fragments seven wicker baskets full.
{15:38} And they eating were four thousand men, besides women and children.
{15:39} And having loosed the crowds, he went into a ship, and came into the bounds of Magdala.
{16:1} And the Pharisees and Sadducees having come, tempting, asked him to shew them a sign from heaven.
{16:2} And he having answered, said to them, It being evening, ye say, Calm weather: for the heaven is fiery red.
{16:3} And in the morning, Today, wintry weather: for heaven, being sad, is fiery red. Hypocrites, truly ye know to decide the face of heaven, but the signs of the times ye cannot.
{16:4} An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; and no sign shall be given her, except the sign of Jonas the prophet. And having left them, he departed.
{16:5} And his disciples having come to the other side, forgot to take loaves.
{16:6} And Jesus said to them, Attend and keep from the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
{16:7} And they reasoned among themselves, saying, Because we took no loaves.
{16:8} And Jesus having known, said to them, Why reason ye among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye have taken no loaves.
{16:9} Do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of five thousand, and how many baskets ye took?
{16:10} Nor the seven loaves of four thousand, and how many wicker baskets ye took?
{16:11} How do ye not understand that I spake not to you concerning bread, to keep from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?
{16:12} Then understood they that he spake, not to keep from the leaven of bread, but from the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
{16:13} And Jesus, having come into the parts of Caesarea of Philippi, asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say me to be, the Son of Man?
{16:14} And they said, Some, truly, John the Baptist: and others, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
{16:15} And he says to them, But whom say ye me to be?
{16:16} And Simon Peter having answered, said, Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.
{16:17} And Jesus, having answered, said to him, Happy art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed to thee, but my Father, he in the heavens.
{16:18} And I say to thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my church; and the gates of hell shall not overcome her.
{16:19} And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens: and whatever thou shalt bind upon earth shall be bound in the heavens: and whatever thou shalt loose upon earth shall be loosed in the heavens.
{16:20} Then he enjoined his disciples that they say to none that he is Jesus Christ.
{16:21} From then Jesus began to shew to his disciples, that he must depart to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised in the third day.
{16:22} And Peter having taken him, began to reproach him, saying, Be propitious to thyself, Lord: this shall not be to thee.
{16:23} And having turned, he said to Peter, Retire behind me, Satan: thou art an offence, to me: for thou hast not in mind the things of God, but the things of men.
{16:24} Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any wish to come after me, let him deny himself absolutely, and lift up his cross, and follow me.
{16:25} For whoever should wish to save his life shall lose it: and whoever shall lose his soul for my sake shall find it.
{16:26} For what is a man profited, if he should gain the whole world, and injure his soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
{16:27} For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his messengers; and then he will give back to each according to his deed.
{16:28} Verily I say to you, Some are standing here, who should not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
{17:1} And after six days Jesus takes Peter, James, and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart.
{17:2} And he was transformed before them: and his face shone as the sun, and his garments were white as the light.
{17:3} And, behold, Moses and Elias were seen to them, conversing with him.
{17:4} And Peter, having answered, said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: let us make here three tents; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
{17:5} He yet speaking, behold, a shining cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son, in whom I was contented; hear ye him.
{17:6} And the disciples, having heard, fell upon their face, and were greatly afraid.
{17:7} And Jesus, having come, touched them, and said, Be raised, and be not afraid.
{17:8} And having lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus alone.
{17:9} And they, coming down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the sight to none, even till the Son of man rises from the dead.
{17:10} And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?
{17:11} And Jesus having answered, said to them, Elias truly comes first and will re-establish all things.
{17:12} And I say to you, That Elias has already come, and they knew him not, but did by him whatever they would. So also the Son of man is about to suffer by them.
{17:13} Then understood the disciples that he told them of John the Baptist.
{17:14} And they having come to the crowd, there came to him a man, supplicating on his knees to him, and saying,
{17:15} Lord, pity my son: for he is a lunatic, and suffers badly: for many times he falls into the fire, and many times into the water.
{17:16} And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
{17:17} And Jesus, having answered, said, O faithless and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you how long shall I endure you? bring him here to me.
{17:18} And Jesus censured him; and the demon went forth out of him: and the child was cured from that hour.
{17:19} Then the disciples having come to Jesus apart, said, Why could not we cast it out?
{17:20} And Jesus said to them, For your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If ye have faith as a kernel of mustard, ye shall say to this mount, Go away from thence, and it shall go away; and nothing shall be impossible to you.
{17:21} But this kind goes not forth but by prayer and fasting.
{17:22} And they having returned into Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men:
{17:23} And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised. And they were greatly grieved.
{17:24} And they having come to Capernaum, they taking double drachmas came to Peter and said, Does not your teacher pay double drachmas?
{17:25} He says, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What seems to thee, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth take taxes or census? from their sons, or from strangers?
{17:26} Peter says to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then are the children free.
{17:27} But that we should not scandalize them, having gone to the sea, cast a fish hook, and lift up the fish coming up first, and having opened its mouth, thou shalt find a gold coin: having taken that, give to them for me and thee.
{18:1} In that hour came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is the greater in the kingdom of the heavens?
{18:2} And Jesus, having called a young child, set it in the midst of them,
{18:3} And said, Truly I say to you, Except ye be turned, and become as young children, ye should not come into the kingdom of the heavens.
{18:4} Whoever, therefore, should be humbled as this young child, the same is the greater in the kingdom of the heavens.
{18:5} And whoever shall receive such a young child in my name, receives me.
{18:6} And whoever should offend one of these little ones believing in me, it is profitable for him that the millstone of an ass be hung upon his neck, and he be sunk in the midst of the sea.
{18:7} Woe to the world for offences I for there is necessity for offences to come; but woe to that man by whom the offence comes!
{18:8} And if thy hand or thy foot give thee cause of offence, cut them off, and cast from thee: it is good for thee to come into life lame or maimed, than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire.
{18:9} And if thine eye give thee cause of offence, take it out, and east from thee: it is good for thee, one-eyed, to enter into life, than having two eyes to be cast into a hell of fire.
{18:10} See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, That their messengers in the heavens always behold the face of my Father which is in the heavens.
{18:11} For the Son of man has come to save the lost.
{18:12} What does it seem to you? if there be to any man a hundred sheep, and one of them have been led astray, does he not, having left the ninety-nine upon the mountains, having gone, seek the one led astray?
{18:13} And if it be found, truly I say to you, he rejoices more over it, than over the ninety-nine not led astray.
{18:14} So is not the will of your Father, he in the heavens, that one of these little ones be lost.
{18:15} And if thy brother sin against thee, retire, and refute him between thee and him alone; if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
{18:16} But if he hear thee not, take with thee yet one or two, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word might stand.
{18:17} And if he refuse hearing them, speak to the church: and if he refuse hearing the church, let him be to thee as of the nations and a publican.
{18:18} Truly I say to you, Whatever things ye should bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever things ye should loose upon earth shall be loosed in heaven.
{18:19} Again, I say to you, That if two of you agree in opinion for everything which they ask, it shall be to them of my Father, he in the heavens.
{18:20} For where two or three are assembled in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
{18:21} Then Peter, having come to him, said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I let him go? Till seven times?
{18:22} And Jesus says to him, I say not to thee, till seven times; but till seventy times seven.
{18:23} Therefore the kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man, the king, who wished to lift up the word together with his servants.
{18:24} And he having begun to settle accounts, one was brought him, a debtor of ten thousand talents.
{18:25} And he not having to give back, his lord ordered him to be sold, and his wife and his children, and all which he had also to be given back.
{18:26} Then the servant, having fallen, worshipped him, saying, Lord, be slow to anger towards me, and I will give back all to thee.
{18:27} And the lord of that servant, having felt compassion, loosed him, and let go to him the money lent.
{18:28} But that servant having come, found one of his fellow-servants who owed him one hundred drachmas, and having seized, he choked him, saying, Give back to me what thou owest.
{18:29} Then his fellow-servant having fallen at his feet besought him, saying, Be slow to anger towards me, and I will give back all to thee.
{18:30} And he would not; but having departed he cast him into prison till he should give back that being owed.
{18:31} And his fellow-servants having seen the thing done, were greatly grieved, and having come, made known to their lord all things done.
{18:32} Then his lord, having called him, said unto him, O thou evil servant, I let go to you all that debt since thou besoughtest me:
{18:33} Oughtest thou not also to pity thy fellow-servant, as I also pitied thee.
{18:34} And his lord having become angry, delivered him to the torturers even till he should give back all being owed to him.
{18:35} So also will my heavenly Father do to you, if ye let not go each to his brother from your hearts their falls.
{19:1} And it was when Jesus finished these words he removed from Galilee, and came from the bounds of Judea beyond Jordan;
{19:2} And many crowds followed him; and he cured them there.
{19:3} And the Pharisees came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to loose his wife for every cause.
{19:4} And having answered, he said to them, Have ye not read, that he having made from the beginning, made them male and female,
{19:5} And said, For this shall a man leave father and mother, and be joined to his wife: and they two shall be one flesh?
{19:6} So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has yoked together, let not man separate.
{19:7} They say to him, Why then did Moses charge to give a writing of divorce, and loose her?
{19:8} He says to them that Moses for your hard heart permitted you to loose your wives: and from the beginning it was not so.
{19:9} And I say to you, That whoever should loose his wife, except for fornication, and marry another, commits adultery; and he having married the one loosed commits adultery.
{19:10} His disciples say to him, If the cause of a man is so with the woman, it is not profitable to marry.
{19:11} And he said to them, All have not room for this word, but to whom it is given.
{19:12} For there are eunuchs, who were born so from the mother's belly: and there are eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of the heavens. He being able to receive, let him receive.
{19:13} Then young children were brought to him, that he might put hands upon them and pray: and the disciples censured them.
{19:14} But Jesus said, Let go the young children, and hinder them not, to come to me: for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.
{19:15} And having put hands upon them, he went out from thence.
{19:16} And, behold, one having come said to him, Good teacher, what good shall I do, that I might have eternal life?
{19:17} And he said to him, Why sayest thou me good? None is good except one, God; but if thou wouldst come into life, keep the commands.
{19:18} He says to him, Which? And Jesus said, thus: Thou shalt not murder; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness;
{19:19} Honour thy father and mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
{19:20} The young man says to him, All these have I watched from my youth; what yet do I want?
{19:21} Jesus said to him, If thou wished to be perfected, retire, sell thy possessions, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
{19:22} And the young man having heard the word, departed, being grieved: for he was holding many possessions.
{19:23} And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly I say to you, That with difficulty shall a rich one come into the kingdom of the heavens.
{19:24} And again I say to you, It is of easier labor for a camel to pass through the hole of a needle, than for a rich one to come into the kingdom of God.
{19:25} And his disciples were greatly struck with amazement, saying, Who then can be saved?
{19:26} And Jesus having looked up said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
{19:27} Then Peter having answered, said to him, Behold, we have let go all things, and have followed thee; what therefore shall be to us?
{19:28} And Jesus said to them, Verily I say to you, That ye having followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man should sit upon the throne of his glory, shall be seated ye also upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
{19:29} And every one who lets go houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for the sake of my name, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.
{19:30} And many first shall be last, and the last first.
{20:1} For the kingdom of the heavens is like to a man, master of a house, who went out as soon as morning to hire workmen for his vineyard.
{20:2} And having agreed for a drachma a day, he sent them to his vineyard.
{20:3} And having gone out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the market-place,
{20:4} And he says to them, Retire ye also into the vineyard, and whatever should be just I will give you: and they departed.
{20:5} Again, having gone out about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.
{20:6} And about the eleventh hour, having gone out, he found others standing idle, and he says to them, Why stand ye here idle the whole day?
{20:7} They say to him, That none has hired us. He says to them, Retire also to the vineyard; and whatever be just, ye shall receive.
{20:8} And it being evening, the lord of the vineyard says to his steward, Call the workmen, and give back to them the wages, beginning from the last even to the first.
{20:9} And they of the eleventh hour having come, thereupon received a drachma.
{20:10} And the first, having come, thought that they will receive more; and they also received thereupon a drachma.
{20:11} And having received, they murmured against the master of the house,
{20:12} Saying, That these last worked one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, having borne the burden and heat of the day.
{20:13} And he, having answered, said to one of them, Friend, I injure thee not; didst not thou agree with me for a drachma?
{20:14} Take thine and retire: and I will to give to this last, as also to thee.
{20:15} Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my things? Or is thine eye evil because I am good.
{20:16} So shall the last be first, and the first last; for many are called, but few chosen.
{20:17} And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and he said to them,
{20:18} Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,
{20:19} And they shall deliver him to the nations to mock, and scourge, and crucify: and he shall be raised the third day.
{20:20} Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, worshipping, and asking something of him.
{20:21} And he said to her, What wilt thou? She says to him, Say that these my two sons might sit, the one on thy right hand, and one on thy left, in thy kingdom.
{20:22} And Jesus having answered, said, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink the cup which I am about to drink, and be immersed with the immersion which I am immersed? They say to him, We can.
{20:23} And he says to them, Truly my cup shall ye drink, and with the immersion which I am immersed shall ye be immersed; but to sit on my right, and on my left, is not mine to give, but to those it was prepared for by my Father.
{20:24} And the ten having heard, felt pain about the two brethren.
{20:25} But Jesus, having called them, said, Ye know that the rulers rule over their nations, and the great exercise authority over them.
{20:26} But it shall not be so among you; but whoever should wish to be great among you, let him be your attendant;
{20:27} And whoever would be first among you, let him be your servant:
{20:28} As the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his soul a ransom for many.
{20:29} And they going out from Jericho, a great crowd followed him.
{20:30} And, behold, two blind sitting by the way, having heard that Jesus passes by, cried out, saying, Pity us, O Lord, son of David.
{20:31} And the crowd censured them that they should be silent: but they cried the more, saying, Pity us, O Lord, son of David.
{20:32} And Jesus having stood, called them, and said, What will ye I shall do to you?
{20:33} They say to him, Lord, that our eyes might be opened.
{20:34} And Jesus, having felt compassion, touched their eyes: and quickly their eyes looked up, and they followed him.
{21:1} And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, to the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, saying to them,
{21:2} Go ye into the town opposite to us, and quickly shall ye find an ass bound, and a colt with her; having loosed, bring to me.
{21:3} And if any one say to you, Why? ye shall say, That the Lord has need of them; and quickly will he send them.
{21:4} And the whole of this was, that that spoken by the prophet be completed; saying,
{21:5} Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy king comes to thee, meek, and mounted upon an ass, and a colt, son of a beast of burden.
{21:6} And the disciples, having gone and done as Jesus commanded them,
{21:7} Brought the ass, and colt, and put on them their garments, and he sat over them.
{21:8} And a very great crowd strewed their garments in the way; and others cut down young shoots from the trees, and strewed in the way.
{21:9} And the crowds leading before, and following, cried, saying, Osanna to the son of David: he coming in the name of the Lord being praised; Osanna in the highest ones.
{21:10} And he having come to Jerusalem, all the city was shaken, saying, Who is this?
{21:11} And the crowds said, This is Jesus, the prophet, from Nazareth of Galilee.
{21:12} And Jesus came into the temple of God, and cast out all those selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the money-changers tables, and the seats of those selling doves,
{21:13} And he says to them, It was written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; and ye have made it a den of robbers.
{21:14} And the blind and lame came to him in the temple; and he cured them.
{21:15} And the chief priests and scribes, seeing the wonderful things which he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Osanna to the son of David; they felt pain.
{21:16} And they said to him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus says to them, Yes; have ye never read, That out of the mouths of young children and sucklings thou hast adjusted praise?
{21:17} And leaving them, he went without the city, to Bethany; and lodged there.
{21:18} And in the morn, having returned into the city, he hungered.
{21:19} And having seen one fig tree by the way, he came to it, and found nothing on it, except leaves only; and he says to it, Let no more fruit be from thee forever. And instantly the fig tree was dried up.
{21:20} And the disciples, seeing, wondered, saying, How suddenly was the fig tree dried up!
{21:21} And Jesus, having answered, said to them, Truly I say to you, if ye have faith, and be not removed, ye shall do not only that of the fig tree, but also to this mountain, if ye should say, Be thou lifted up, and cast into the sea, it shall be.
{21:22} And all things, whatever ye ask in prayer, believing, shall ye receive.
{21:23} And to him, having come into the temple to him teaching, came the chief priests and elders of the people, saying, By what authority doest thou these? and who gave thee this authority?
{21:24} And Jesus, having answered, said to them, I will also ask you one word, which if ye tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these.
{21:25} The baptism of John, whence was it of heaven or of men And they reasoned by themselves, saying, If we say, of heaven; he will say to us, Why, then, believed ye him not?
{21:26} But if we say, of men; we fear the crowd; for all hold John as a prophet.
{21:27} And having answered Jesus, they said, We know not. And he said to them, Neither do I say to you, by what authority I do these.
{21:28} But what seems to you A man had two children; and having come to the first, he said, Child, retire today, work in my vineyard.
{21:29} And he, having answered, said, I will not; but afterward, having felt regret, he departed.
{21:30} And having come to the second, he said likewise. And he, having answered, said, I, Lord: and he departed not.
{21:31} Which of the two did the father's will? They say to him, The first. Jesus says to them, Truly I say to you, that publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
{21:32} For John came to you in the way of justice, and ye believed him not: and the publicans and harlots believed him; and ye, seeing, repented not afterwards, to believe him.
{21:33} Hear another parable: A certain man was master of a house, who planted a vineyard, and put a hedge around it, and digged in it a winepress, and let it out to farmers, and went abroad:
{21:34} And when the time of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his parts.
{21:35} And the farmers having taken his servants, truly one they stripped, and one they killed, and one they stoned.
{21:36} Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did to them likewise.
{21:37} And afterwards he sent to them his son, saying, They will be changed by my son.
{21:38} And the farmers, seeing the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and possess his inheritance.
{21:39} And having taken, they cast out of the vineyard, and killed.
{21:40} When, therefore, the lord of the vineyard should come, what will he do to those farmers?
{21:41} They say to him, He will miserably destroy these wicked, and let out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give back to him the fruits in their seasons.
{21:42} Jesus says to them, Have ye never read in the writings, The stone which the builders disapproved of, this was for the head of the corner? This was from the Lord, and it was wonderful in your eyes.
{21:43} For this I say to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a nation doing its fruits.
{21:44} And he falling upon this stone shall be crushed: but upon whomsoever it should fall, it shall winnow him.
{21:45} And the chief priests and Pharisees, having heard his parable, knew that he spake of them.
{21:46} And seeking to lay hold on him, they feared the crowd, since they held him as a prophet.
{22:1} And Jesus, having answered, spake to them in parables, saying,
{22:2} The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who made a nuptial feast for his son.
{22:3} And he sent his servants to those having been called to the nuptial feast: and they would not come.
{22:4} And again, he sent other servants, saying, Say to the called: Behold, I have prepared my supper; my bulls and stall-fed killed, and all prepared: come to the nuptials.
{22:5} And they, not having heeded, departed, one truly to his own field, and one to his traffic:
{22:6} And the rest, having seized his servants, were insolent, and killed them.
{22:7} And the king, having heard, was angry, and having sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.
{22:8} Then says he to his servants, Truly the nuptial feast is prepared, and those called were not worthy.
{22:9} Go ye, therefore, to the passages of the ways, and as many as ye should find, call to the nuptial feast.
{22:10} And those servants, having come to the ways, gathered together all, as many as they found, also both the evil and good, and the nuptial feast was filled with the reclining.
{22:11} And the king, having come in to behold the reclining, saw there a man not clad with the garment of the wedding:
{22:12} And he says to him, Friend, how camest thou in here, not having a garment of the nuptial feast? And he was muzzled.
{22:13} Then said the king to his servants, Having bound his feet and hands, take him away, and cast ye him into outer darkness; weeping shall be there, and gnashing of teeth.
{22:14} For many are called, and few chosen.
{22:15} Then the Pharisees, having gone, took counsel how they might ensnare him in word.
{22:16} And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and care is to thee for none; for thou lookest not to the face of men.
{22:17} Therefore say to us, What seems to thee Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
{22:18} But Jesus, having known their evil, said, Why tempt ye me, hypocrites?
{22:19} Show me the piece of money of tribute. And they brought him a drachma.
{22:20} And he says to them, Whose is this image and inscription?
{22:21} They say to him, Caesar's. Then says he to them, Give back then to Caesar the things of Caesar; and the things of God to God.
{22:22} And having heard, they wondered, and having left him, they departed.
{22:23} In that day the Sadducees came to him, they saying there is to be no rising up: and they asked him,
{22:24} Saying, Teacher, Moses said, If any one die, not having children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
{22:25} And with us were seven brethren: and the first, having married, died; and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother.
{22:26} And likewise the second, and third, even till the seven.
{22:27} And after all died also the woman.
{22:28} Therefore in the rising up whose of the seven shall the woman be? for they all had her.
{22:29} And Jesus, having answered, said to them, Ye are led astray, not having known the writings, nor the power of God.
{22:30} For in the rising up they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the messengers of God in heaven.
{22:31} And for the rising up of the dead, read ye not that spoken by God, saying,
{22:32} I am God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
{22:33} And the crowds having heard, were astonished at his teaching.
{22:34} And the Pharisees having heard that he muzzled the Sadducees, were gathered upon the same.
{22:35} And one of them, skilled in the law, asked, tempting him, and saying,
{22:36} Teacher, which the great command in the law?
{22:37} And Jesus said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind.
{22:38} This is the first and the great command.
{22:39} And the second like it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
{22:40} In these two commands hang the whole law and the prophets.
{22:41} And the Pharisees having been gathered together, Jesus asked them,
{22:42} Saying, What seems to you about Christ? Whose son is he They say to him, David's.
{22:43} He says to them, How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
{22:44} The Lord said to my Lord, Sit by my right, till I make thine enemies the footstool of my feet.
{22:45} If, therefore, David calls him Lord, how is he his son.
{22:46} And none could answer him a word, nor dared any one from that day to ask him any more.
{23:1} Then spake Jesus to the crowds and to his disciples,
{23:2} Saying, Upon Moses' seat sat the scribes and Pharisees.
{23:3} Therefore all whatever they say to you to keep, keep and do; and according to their works do not, for they say and do not.
{23:4} For they bind loads heavy and difficult to carry, and put upon men's shoulders; and with their fingers will they not move them.
{23:5} And all their works do they, to be seen by men: and make broad their preservatives, and enlarge the border of their garments.
{23:6} And love the first place at suppers, and the first seat in the assemblies,
{23:7} And greetings in the markets, and to be called by men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
{23:8} And be ye not called Rabbi: for one is your guide, Christ; and all ye are brethren.
{23:9} And call not your father upon earth: for one is your Father, which in the heavens.
{23:10} Nor be ye called leaders, for one is your Leader, Christ.
{23:11} And the greater of you shall be your servant.
{23:12} And whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and whoever shall humble himself, shall be exalted.
{23:13} Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye lock up the kingdom of the heavens before men: for ye come not in yourselves, neither those coming in, permit ye to come in.
{23:14} Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for pretence, praying at great lengths; for this shall ye receive more distinguished judgment.
{23:15} Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! for ye go about sea and dry land to make one proselyte, and when he should become, ye make him the son of hell, twofold more than you.
{23:16} Woe to you blind guides, saying, Whoever should swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever should swear by the gold of the temple, he is indebted!
{23:17} Foolish and blind; for which is the greater, the gold, or the temple consecrating the gold?
{23:18} And, Whoever should swear by the altar, it is nothing; and whoever should swear by the gift above it, he is indebted.
{23:19} Foolish and blind: for which is the greater, the gift, or the altar, consecrating the gifts?
{23:20} Therefore, he having sworn by the altar, swears by it, and by all above it.
{23:21} And he having sworn by the temple, swears by it, and by him dwelling in it.
{23:22} And he having sworn by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him sitting above it.
{23:23} Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye exact tenths and dill and cummin, and ye have left the weightier things of the law, judgment, and mercy, and faith: these it was necessary to do, and not to let go those.
{23:24} Blind guides, straining a gnat, and swallowing down a camel.
{23:25} Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup, and the side dish of sweet-meats, and within they are full of pillage and bad mixture.
{23:26} O blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup, and side dish of sweetmeats, that also their outside might be clean.
{23:27} Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like whitewashed tombs, which without indeed appear beautiful, but within are full of the bones of the dead, and of all uncleanness.
{23:28} So also ye without truly appear just to men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
{23:29} Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and deck the monuments of the just,
{23:30} And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we had not been their partakers in the blood of the prophets,
{23:31} Wherefore ye bear testimony to yourselves, that ye are the sons of those having slain the prophets.
{23:32} And fill ye up yourselves the measure of your fathers.
{23:33} Serpents, generations of vipers, how would ye flee from the judgment of hell?
{23:34} Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets, and the wise, and scribes: and of them shall ye kill and crucify; and of them shall ye chastise in your assemblies, and drive out from city to city,
{23:35} So that all the just blood shed upon the earth might come upon you, from the blood of just Abel to the blood of Zacharias, son of Barachias, whom ye killed between the temple and altar.
{23:36} Truly I say to you, All these shall come upon this generation.
{23:37} Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets, and stoning those sent to her; how often did I wish to gather thy children together, which manner a bird gathers together her young broods under the wings, and ye would not!
{23:38} Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
{23:39} For I say to you, Ye should not see me from henceforth, till ye should say, Praised be he coming in the name of the Lord.
{24:1} And Jesus having gone out, went out of the temple: and his disciples came near to shew him the buildings of the temple.
{24:2} And Jesus said to them, See ye not all these? truly I say to you, Stone upon stone shall not be left here, which shall not be loosened.
{24:3} And sitting upon the mount of Olives, his disciples came to him apart, saying, Say to us when these shall be, and what the sign of thy arrival, and the termination of the time.
{24:4} And Jesus having answered, said to them, See lest any lead you astray.
{24:5} For many shall come upon my name, saying, I am Christ; and deceive many.
{24:6} And ye will be about to hear of wars and rumors of war: see, be not terrified; for all must be, but the end is not yet.
{24:7} For nation shall be raised up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and plagues, and shakings in places.
{24:8} And all these the beginning of anguish.
{24:9} Then shall they deliver you to pressure, and they shall kill you: and ye shall be hated by all nations, for my name.
{24:10} And then shall many be offended, and they shall deliver up one another, and they shall hate one another.
{24:11} And many false prophets shall be raised up, and deceive many.
{24:12} And because anxiety shall increase, the love of many shall be cooled.
{24:13} But he having persevered to the end, this shall be saved.
{24:14} And this good news of the kingdom shall be proclaimed in the whole habitable globe for a witness to all nations: and then shall the end come.
{24:15} Therefore, when ye see the abomination of devastation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, (let him reading, understand:)
{24:16} Then let them in Judea flee to the mountain;
{24:17} He upon the house-tops, let him not come down to take away anything out of his house:
{24:18} And he in the field, let him not turn back to take up his garments:
{24:19} And woe to those having in the womb, and to those giving suck, in those days!
{24:20} And pray that your flight be not in winter, nor in the sabbath.
{24:21} For then shall be great pressure, such as has not been from the beginning of the world till now, nor should be.
{24:22} And except those days had been shortened, no flesh should be saved: but for the chosen, those days shall be shortened.
{24:23} Then if any say to you, Behold, here Christ, or there; believe ye not.
{24:24} For false Christs, and false prophets, shall be raised up, and give great signs and wonders; so as to deceive, if possible, also the chosen.
{24:25} Behold, I have told you beforehand.
{24:26} If therefore they should say to you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth; Behold, in the store-houses, believe ye not.
{24:27} For as the lightning comes forth from the sunrisings, and shines to the descents; so also shall be the arrival of the Son of man.
{24:28} For wherever be the fall, there will the eagles be gathered together.
{24:29} And quickly after the pressure of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from the heavens, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken;
{24:30} And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then shall the tribes of the earth lament bitterly, and they shall see the Son of man coming upon the clouds of heaven with power and much glory.
{24:31} And he shall send his messengers, with the great voice of the trumpet, and they shall bring together his chosen from the four winds, from the extremities of the heavens to the extremities.
{24:32} And from the fig tree learn a parable; When already her young shoot should be tender, and the leaves should spring forth, ye know that summer is near:
{24:33} So also ye, when ye should see all these things, know ye that it is near at the doors.
{24:34} Truly I say to you, That this generation should not pass away, till all these things should be.
{24:35} The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words should not pass away.
{24:36} And concerning that day and hour, none know, nor the messengers of the heavens, except my Father only.
{24:37} And as the days of Noe, so shall be the arrival of the Son of man.
{24:38} For as they were in the days of the inundation, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noe came into the ark,
{24:39} And knew not till the inundation came, and took them all away; so also shall be the arrival of the Son of man.
{24:40} Then shall be two in the field; one shall be taken, and one is let go;
{24:41} Two grinding in the mill; one shall be taken, and one let go.
{24:42} Watch therefore; for ye know not what hour your Lord comes.
{24:43} But know this, that if the master of the house had known what watch the thief comes, he had watched, and would not have suffered his house to be undermined.
{24:44} Therefore be ye also prepared: for what hour ye think not, the Son of man comes.
{24:45} Who then is the faithful and discerning servant, which his lord set over his attendance, to give them food in due season.
{24:46} Happy that servant which his lord, having come, shall find doing thus.
{24:47} Truly I say to you, That he shall set him over all his possessions.
{24:48} But if that servant say in his heart, My lord delays to come;
{24:49} And he should begin to strike the fellow-servants, and to eat and drink with those intoxicated;
{24:50} The lord of that servant shall come in a day that he expects not, and in an hour which he knows not,
{24:51} And he shall cut him in two equal parts, and he shall set his portion with the hypocrites: and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
{25:1} Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins, who having taken their lanterns, went forth to the meeting of the bridegroom.
{25:2} And five of them were discerning, and five foolish.
{25:3} Those foolish having taken their lanterns, took no oil with them.
{25:4} And the discerning took oil in their vessels with their lanterns.
{25:5} And the bridegroom delaying, they all slumbered and slept.
{25:6} And in the middle of the night there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom comes; go ye forth to his meeting.
{25:7} Then all these virgins were aroused, and put their lanterns in order.
{25:8} And the foolish said to the discerning, Give us of your oil; for our lights are quenched.
{25:9} And the discerning answered, saying, Lest it should not suffice us and you: but go ye rather to those selling, and buy for yourselves.
{25:10} And they, going to buy, the bridegroom came; and they prepared, went in with him to the nuptials; and the door was locked.
{25:11} And afterwards came also the rest of the virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
{25:12} And he having answered said, Truly I say to you, I know you not.
{25:13} Watch, therefore, for ye know not the day, neither the hour, in which the Son of man comes.
{25:14} For as a man going abroad, called his own servants, and delivered them his possessions:
{25:15} And to one he truly gave five talents, and to one, two, and to one, one; to each according to his own power; and he quickly went abroad.
{25:16} And he having received five talents, having gone, worked with them, and he made other five talents.
{25:17} Likewise he having the two also, gained he also other two.
{25:18} And he having received one, having departed, dug in the earth, and concealed his lord's silver.
{25:19} And after much time the lord of these servants comes, and lifts up the word with them.
{25:20} And he having received the five talents, having come near, brought the other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst me five talents: and I have gained other five talents.
{25:21} And his lord said to him, Well, good and faithful servant: thou west faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many; enter into the joy of thy lord.
{25:22} And he also having received the two talents, having come near said, Lord, thou deliveredst me two talents; see, I gained two other talents to them.
{25:23} His lord said to him, Well, good and faithful servant; thou wast faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many; enter into the joy of thy lord.
{25:24} And he also having received one talent, having come near, said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou sowedst not, and gathering where thou scatteredst not:
{25:25} And having been afraid, having gone away, I concealed thy talent in the earth; see, thou hast thine own.
{25:26} And his lord having answered, said to him, O evil and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I scattered not:
{25:27} Thou therefore oughtest to have cast my silver to the money-changers, and I having come, had received mine own, with interest.
{25:28} Therefore take the talent away from him, and give him having ten talents.
{25:29} For to every one having shall be given, and he shall be in abundance: and from him not having, also what he has shall be taken away from him.
{25:30} And cast ye the useless servant into darkness without; weeping shall be there, and gnashing of teeth.
{25:31} And when the Son of man should come in his glory, and all his holy messengers with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
{25:32} And all nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall separate them from one another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the kids.
{25:33} And he shall set the sheep from his right, and the kids from his left.
{25:34} Then shall the king say to them from his right, Come, the praised of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
{25:35} For I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and ye brought me in:
{25:36} Naked, and ye put around me: I was sick, and ye reviewed me: I was in prison, and ye came to me.
{25:37} Then shall the just answer him saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungering, and nourished or thirsting, and gave to drink.
{25:38} And when saw we thee a stranger, and brought in or naked, and put around.
{25:39} And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came to thee?
{25:40} And the king having answered, will say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as ye did to one of the least of my brethren, ye did to me.
{25:41} Then shall he say to them from the left, Go away from me, the cursed, into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his messengers:
{25:42} For I was hungry, and ye gave me not to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;
{25:43} I was a stranger and ye brought me not in; naked, and ye put not around me; sick, and in prison, and ye took not a view of me.
{25:44} Then shall they answer him, they also saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and attended not to thee?
{25:45} Then shall he answer them saying, Inasmuch as ye did not to one of the least of these, ye did not to me.
{25:46} And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: and the just into eternal life.
{26:1} And it was when Jesus finished all the words, he said to his disciples.
{26:2} Ye know that after two days is the passover, and the Son of man shall be delivered to be crucified.
{26:3} Then were gathered together the chief priests, and scribes, and the more ancient of the people, into the court-yard of the chief priest, called Caiaphas,
{26:4} And they counselled together, that they might obtain Jesus by stratagem, and might kill.
{26:5} And they said, Not in the festival, lest there should be an uproar among the people.
{26:6} And Jesus having been in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leprous,
{26:7} There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of costly perfumed ointment, and she poured upon the head of him, reclining at table.
{26:8} And his disciples seeing, felt pain, saying, For what this loss?
{26:9} For this perfumed oil could have been sold for much, and have been given to the poor.
{26:10} And Jesus having known, said to them, Why offer ye toils to the woman? for a good work has she worked upon me.
{26:11} For always the poor ye have with you, but me ye have not always.
{26:12} For she, casting this perfumed oil upon my body, did to prepare me for interment,
{26:13} Truly I say to you, Wheresoever this good news be proclaimed in the whole world, shall it also be spoken what she did, for a remembrance of her.
{26:14} Then one of the twelve having gone forth, he being called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests,
{26:15} Said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him to you? and they placed to him thirty silver coins.
{26:16} And from then he sought opportunity, that he might deliver him.
{26:17} And in the first of the unleavened loaves, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where wilt thou we should prepare for thee to eat the pascha?
{26:18} And he said, Retire ye into the city, to a certain person, and say to him, The teacher says, My time is near; with thee do I the pascha with my disciples.
{26:19} And the disciples did as Jesus commanded them: and they prepared the passover.
{26:20} And it being evening, he reclined at table with the twelve.
{26:21} And they eating, he said, Truly I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.
{26:22} And they being greatly grieved, began each of them to say to him, Far from it am I, O Lord:
{26:23} And he having answered, said, He having dipped with me the hand in the small dish, the same shall deliver me up.
{26:24} Truly the Son of man retires as has been written concerning him; and woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up! it was good for him if that man had not been born.
{26:25} And Judas delivering him up, having answered, said, Far from it, am I, Rabbi? He said to him, Thou hast said.
{26:26} And they eating, Jesus, having taken the bread and praised, brake and gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
{26:27} And having taken the cup, and given thanks, he gave to them, saying, Drink of it all ye.
{26:28} For this is my blood, that of the new covenant, having been poured out for many, for the remission of sins.
{26:29} And I say to you, that I drink not from henceforth of this fruit of the vine, even till that day when I drink it new with you, in the kingdom of my Father.
{26:30} And having sung, they went forth to the mount of Olives.
{26:31} Then says Jesus to them, All ye shall be scandalized in me this night; for it has been written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered up and down.
{26:32} And after I be raised, I will lead before you into Galilee.
{26:33} And Peter having answered, said to him, And if all men shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized.
{26:34} Jesus says to him, Truly I say to thee that in this night, before the cock utters a sound, thou shalt deny me thrice.
{26:35} Peter says to him, Though it should be necessary for me to die with thee, I will not deny thee: likewise also said all the disciples.
{26:36} Then comes Jesus with them into the place called Gethsemane, and says to the disciples, Sit here, till I, having gone, shall pray.
{26:37} And having taken Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be grieved, and to be dejected.
{26:38} Then says he to them, My soul is sorely grieved, even to death: remain here, and watch ye with me.
{26:39} And having gone forward a little, he fell upon his face, praying, and saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me: but not as I will, but as thou.
{26:40} And he comes to his disciples, and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, So were ye not able to watch with me one hour?
{26:41} Watch and pray, lest ye come into temptation: truly the spirit of a ready will, and the flesh weak.
{26:42} Again of a second time, having gone away, he prayed, saying, My Father if this cup cannot pass away from me except I drink it, let thy will be.
{26:43} And having gone he finds them again sleeping: for their eyes were loaded.
{26:44} And having left them, having gone away again, he prayed of the third time, speaking the same word.
{26:45} Then comes he to his disciples, and says to them, Sleep for the remaining time, and take rest: behold, the hour has drawn near, and the Son of man is delivered into the hands of the sinful.
{26:46} Be aroused, let us lead forth; behold, he delivering me up, has drawn near.
{26:47} And he yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd, with swords, and sticks, from the chief priests, and the more ancient of the people.
{26:48} And he delivering him up, gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, the same is he: hold him firmly.
{26:49} And quickly having come to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi! and kissed him.
{26:50} And Jesus said to him, Friend, for what comest thou? Then having come near, they put hands upon Jesus, and held him firmly.
{26:51} And, behold, one of them with Jesus, having stretched out the hand, pulled out his sword, having struck the chief priest's servant, took away his ear.
{26:52} Then says Jesus to him, Turn back thy sword to its place: for all they having taken the sword, shall perish by the sword.
{26:53} Thinkest thou that I am not able to call to my Father for aid, and he will set before me more than twelve legions of messengers?
{26:54} How then would the writings be filled up, that so it must be?
{26:55} In that hour, Jesus said to the crowds, As against a robber came ye out, with swords and sticks, to take me? In the day I sat down with you, teaching, and ye took not hold of me.
{26:56} But this has been wholly that the writings of the prophets might be filled up. Then all the disciples, having left him, fled.
{26:57} And they having held Jesus, brought to Caiaphas the chief priest, where the scribes and elders were gathered together.
{26:58} And Peter followed him from far, even to the court-yard of the chief priest, and having entered within, he sat with the attendants, to see the end.
{26:59} And the chief priests, and the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death;
{26:60} And they found not: and many false witnesses having come near, they found not.
{26:61} And afterwards two false witnesses, having come near, said, This said, I can loosen the temple of God, and after three days build it.
{26:62} And the chief priest, having risen, said to him, Answerest thou nothing? what do these witness against thee?
{26:63} But Jesus was silent. And the chief priest having answered, said to him, I cause thee to swear by the living God, that thou tell us, if thou art Christ, the Son of God.
{26:64} And Jesus says to him, Thou hast said: but I say to you, from henceforth ye shall see the Son of man, sitting from the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
{26:65} Then the chief priest tore his garments, saying, That he blasphemed: what further need have we of witnesses? see, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
{26:66} What seems to you? And they having answered, said, He is liable to the penalty of death.
{26:67} Then did they spit in his face, and cuffed him, and struck him with a rod:
{26:68} Saying, Prophesy to us, O Christ, Who is he having struck thee.
{26:69} And Peter sat without in the court-yard, and one young girl came to him saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
{26:70} And he denied before all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
{26:71} And he having gone out into the gate, another saw him, and she says to them there, This also was with Jesus the Nazarite.
{26:72} And again he denied with an oath, That I know not the man.
{26:73} And a little after, those standing, having come near, said to Peter, Truly thou also art of them; for also thy speech makes thee manifest.
{26:74} Then began he to anathematize, and to swear, That I know not the man: and quickly the cock uttered a sound.
{26:75} And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, having said to him, That before the cock utter a sound, thou shalt deny me thrice. And having gone forth without, he wept bitterly.
{27:1} And having been morning, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, to kill him:
{27:2} And having bound they brought him away, and they delivered him to Pontius Pilate, the leader.
{27:3} Then Judas, he delivering him up, having seen that he was condemned, having felt regret, returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests, and the more ancient,
{27:4} Saying, I have sinned, having delivered up guiltless blood. And they said, What to us? thou shalt see.
{27:5} And having cast down the silver coins in the temple, he withdrew and having gone away, he strangled him self.
{27:6} And the chief priests, having taken the silver coins, said, It is not lawful to cast them for an offering, since it is the price of blood.
{27:7} And having taken counsel, they purchased with them the potter's field, for the interment to strangers.
{27:8} Wherefore, that field was called, The field of blood, even to this day.
{27:9} Then was completed that having been spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty silver coins, the price of him prized, whom they from the sons of Israel prized;
{27:10} And they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.
{27:11} And Jesus stood before the leader: and the leader asked him, saying, Art thou King of the Jews? Jesus said to him, Thou sayest.
{27:12} And in the accusing him by the chief priests and the more ancient, he answered nothing.
{27:13} Then says Pilate to him, Hearest thou not what they witness against thee?
{27:14} And he answered him not to one word: so that the leader wondered greatly.
{27:15} And in the festival the leader was accustomed to loose one imprisoned to the crowd, which they desired.
{27:16} And they had then an imprisoned distinguished, called Barabbas.
{27:17} Therefore they assembled together, Pilate laid to them, Whom will ye I shall loose to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, called Christ?
{27:18} For he knew that through envy, they had delivered him, up.
{27:19} And he sitting upon the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Nothing to thee and that just one: for I have suffered this day many things in a dream, on his account.
{27:20} And the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
{27:21} And the leader having answered, said to them, Which of the two will ye I shall loose to you? And they said, Barabbas.
{27:22} Pilate says to them, What then shall I do with Jesus, called Christ? They all say to him, Let him be crucified.
{27:23} And the leader said, For what evil hath he done? and they cried excessively, saying, Let him be crucified.
{27:24} And Pilate, seeing that it profits nothing, but there is rather an uproar, having taken water, he washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am guiltless of the blood of this just one: ye shall see yourselves.
{27:25} And all the people having answered, said, His blood upon us, and upon our children.
{27:26} Then he loosed to them Barabbas: and having scourged Jesus, delivered him up, that, he might be crucified.
{27:27} Then the soldiers of the leader, having taken Jesus to the Pretorium, gathered together the whole band against him.
{27:28} And having unclothed him, they put round him a scarlet, loose, warm cloak.
{27:29} And having twined a crown of thorns, they put upon, his head: and a reed upon his right hand: and having fallen upon the knees before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
{27:30} And having spit upon him, they took the reed, and struck upon his head.
{27:31} And when they mocked him, they put off from him the loose, warm cloak, and put on him his garments, and brought him away to crucify.
{27:32} And coming, they found a man, a Cyrenian, Simon by name; they compelled him that he should lift up his cross.
{27:33} And having come, to the place called Golgotha, which is called the place of the skull,
{27:34} They gave him vinegar to drink. (mingled with bile: and having tasted, he would not drink.
{27:35} And having crucified him, they divided his garments among them, casting lot: that that spoken by the prophet might be filled up: They divided among them my garments, and upon my clothing they cast lot.
{27:36} And sitting down, they observed him there.
{27:37} And they set above his head his accusation, having been written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
{27:38} Then were crucified with him two robbers; one from the right hand, and the other from the left.
{27:39} And they coming near, blasphemed him, shaking their heads,
{27:40} And saying, He loosing the temple, and building in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.
{27:41} And likewise also the chief priests mocking, with the scribes and elders, said,
{27:42} Others he saved; himself he cannot save. If he is King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him:
{27:43} He trusted upon God; let him now deliver him, if he desires him: for he said, That I am the Son of God.
{27:44} And the robbers crucified with him, reproached him with the same.
{27:45} And from the sixth hour, darkness was upon all the earth, even to the ninth hour.
{27:46} And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a great voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani I this is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
{27:47} And some of them standing there, having heard, said, That he calls Elias.
{27:48} And quickly one of them, having run, and taken a sponge, and filled with vinegar, and put upon a reed, gave him to drink.
{27:49} And the rest said, Let go: we should see if Elias comes, going to save him.
{27:50} And Jesus, again having cried with a great voice, let go the spirit.
{27:51} And, behold, the covering of the temple was cleft in two, from above to below; and the earth was shaken; and the rocks were cleft:
{27:52} And the tombs were opened: and many bodies of the holy ones, having been set to sleep, were raised,
{27:53} And having come forth from the tombs, after his arising, went into the holy city, and were exhibited to many.
{27:54} And the centurion, and they with him, observing Jesus, having seen the shaking, and the things having been, were greatly afraid, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
{27:55} And many women were there, beholding from far off, who followed Jesus out of Galilee, serving him:
{27:56} Among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
{27:57} And being evening, then there came a rich man from Arimathea, Joseph by name, who also himself was a disciple to Jesus:
{27:58} He having come to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered the body to be given back.
{27:59} And Joseph having taken the body, inwrapped it in clean fine linen:
{27:60} And put it in his new tomb, which he quarried in the rock: and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, he departed.
{27:61} And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.
{27:62} And in the morrow, which is after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate.
{27:63} Saying, Lord, we remember that that impostor said, yet living, After three days, I arise.
{27:64} Order therefore, the tomb to be rendered secure till the third day, lest his disciples, having come by night, should steal him, and say to the people, He was raised from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first.
{27:65} And Pilate said to them, Ye have a watch: retire, render secure as ye know.
{27:66} And they, having gone, rendered the tomb secure, having sealed the stone with the watch.
{28:1} And after the sabbaths, in the shining forth to one of the sabbaths, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to behold the tomb.
{28:2} And, behold, there was a great shaking; for a messenger of the Lord, having come down out of heaven, having come near, rolled away the stone from the door, and sat above it.
{28:3} And his aspect was as lightning, and his garment white as snow.
{28:4} And from fear of him the keepers were shaken, and were as dead.
{28:5} And the messenger, having answered, said to the women, Be ye not afraid; for I know that ye seek Jesus, having been crucified.
{28:6} He is not here: for he was raised, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
{28:7} And having gone quickly, say ye to his disciples, that he was raised from the dead; and, behold, he leads before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him: behold I have said to you.
{28:8} And they having come quickly from the tomb, with fear and great joy, ran to announce to his disciples.
{28:9} And as they were going to announce to his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, Rejoice ye. And they having come, held his feet firmly, and worshipped him.
{28:10} Then says Jesus to them, Be ye not afraid: retire, and announce to my brethren that they should go away into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
{28:11} And they going, behold certain of the watch having come to the city, announced to the chief priests all having been done.
{28:12} And having been gathered together with the elders, and having taken counsel, they gave sufficient silver coins to the soldiers,
{28:13} Saying, Say ye, That his disciples having come by night, stole him, we being asleep.
{28:14} And if this should be beard by the leader, we will persuade him, and we will make you undisturbed.
{28:15} And they having received the silver coins, did as they were taught; and this word was spread a report by the Jews till this day.
{28:16} And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, into a mountain, where Jesus commanded them:
{28:17} And having seen him, they worshipped him; and some doubted.
{28:18} And Jesus, having come near, spake to them, saying, All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth:
{28:19} Therefore, having gone, disciple all nations; immersing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit:
{28:20} Teaching them to keep all things whatever I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you all the days, even to the end of time. Amen.
